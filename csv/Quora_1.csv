Squid Game,"Who is your favourite Squid game character, and why?","Many may disagree with my take on this question, but for me it is Cho Sang-Woo who is my favourite character. He is the most realistic character in squid game and although he may have been cruel, he did what he had to survive. Sang-Woo graduated from Seoul National University which is the most prestigious university in Korea. There is a misconception that everyone who graduates from such a university will succeed in life. However, Sang-Woo is in deep debt and even tries resorting to alcohol and suicide.  This shows that anyone can fail in life by making wrong decisions regardless of who they are and what education they receive. The narrative that Sang-Woo is an evil, cold hearted murderer is simply false. All he wants to do is live life and make his mother proud. He is a good guy in the outside world but once his life is on the line in the squid game, he throws all of this away to survive. In the honeycomb game, he purposely makes Gi-hun choose the hardest one in order for him to be eliminated. This plan fails but the audience is left knowing that Sang-Woo will do whatever to win. In the next game which is tug of war, Sang-Woo is obviously displeased as his team is at a huge disadvantage having 3 women and an elderly man. Gi-hun let them into his team out of sympathy. This is where Sang-Woo differs from the other main characters. He doesn‚Äôt care about pity or others. He cares about one thing and one thing alone: being the winner Through the power of Plot Armour, Gi-Hun and his team pull off the win. The next game is marbles and Sang-Woo picks a man called Ali to be his partner. Ali is a poor foreigner who needs the money for his family. Sang-Woo won his trust and respect early on when he gave him bus fare money. Ali trusts Sang-Woo the entire series but when they realise that they are playing against the partner they chose, both are shocked. Squid game is based off Korean children‚Äôs games and Ali being a foreigner is not familiar with them. Sang-Woo plays a game of chance expecting to easily win but is curbstomped by Ali. If Ali wins one more time, Sang-Woo dies. He begs Ali to play a different game and accuses him of cheating. Ali reluctantly agrees due to the trust he built with Sang-Woo. Sang-Woo assures him that they will both survive and gives him a bag of stones and keeps the marbles for himself.  He then walks out as Ali is left in utter despair when he realises what Sang-Woo did. Ali is killed and Sang-Woo flinches, knowing he killed an innocent man who had full trust in him. But he moves on, knowing there can only be one winner. The next game is stepping stones. There are multiple panes of glass and half of them are tempered glass while the other half is normal glass. The characters have to jump onto the tempered glass or fall to their death. With a few second remaining, Sang-Woo pushes the person in front of him to their death and jumps through to clear the challenge. Gi-Hun later angrily confronts him about this saying that he did not have to kill him. However, Sang-Woo was once again doing anything he could to win. Before the final game, the remaining contestants: Sang-Woo, Gi-Hun and Saebyeok are given time to sleep. Gi-Hun and Saebyeok form an alliance to defeat Sang-Woo. However, Saebyeok is critically injured from the last challenge and needs immediate medical assistance. In the few moments that Gi-Hun uses to ask for help, Sang-Woo brutally murders Saebyeok. This was actually the rational thing to do as he had just made the chances of him winning much higher. Gi-Hun is enraged and swears to avenge Saebyeok. The final game is the squid game. A game where one person defends while the other attacks.  The purpose of the game is for the attacker to step foot in the triangular shape in the circle at the left. The attacker has to go through the small opening on the right while the defender stands in that gap to stop them using any force necessary. Both characters are given knifes and this is where Gi-Hun makes yet another mistake. He lets his emotion overcome him. He chooses offence when the clear advantage is with the defender. The attacker cannot get through the gap without being injured by the knife, Gi-Hun only chose offence so that he could attack to avenge Saebyeok. Due to plot induced stupidity, Gi-Hun somehow ends up winning but still manages to be stupid enough to spare Sang-Woo‚Äôs life. Luckily for him, Sang-Woo decides to kill himself thus declaring Gi-Hun the winner. Throughout the entire Kdrama, Sang-Woo did everything he could do secure victory. He threw away all emotion and relationships with his allies and friends. If squid game was in real life, Sang-Woo would easily have been the winner. Even though he had to murder, lie and betray to win, he still won. There can only be one winner and the right mindset in this situation is to put yourself first before anyone else. Sang-Woo is not a bad guy. He just needs the money just as everyone else participating did and he used all his effort to try and win. That‚Äôs why he is my favourite character",https://www.quora.com/Who-is-your-favourite-Squid-game-character-and-why,Just finished this series last night. What an ending‚Ä¶how I didn‚Äôt see that coming is beyond me. Great series.

Squid Game,What's your opinion about the new series on Netflix called Squid Game?,"One word Deabak !!!!Loved it‚Ä¶. To start with I didn't watch trailer nor spoliers ( saw few photo's but again that didn't reveal anything) and to be honest that helped me a lot cause I watched it as a blind audience.... All I knew was there was some kind of game going on. Reasons  : I loved first episode .It was clear from the start and gave us an idea of what kind of life participants were Living on .That felt real and ofcourse gong yoo was just there to make me sure I watching something good , ( I was literally shocked cause I didn't see him act after goblin ). When I said clear I meant it was well explained ..Who he is , how he got into the game ,why he got in to the game and wasn't like he Just randomly got in to it . Next thing what I liked About the series was the concept.It shows how far human can go to survive .I was literally thinking of myself in that situation and was would just think even I would have done that.It was more of human versus human . Acting , They lived the character . Every character leaves a mark and the portrayal of emotion , the helplessness , those greed etc was realastic ‚Ä¶loved it ‚Ä¶ Games : All the games in it were of kids .Who knew kids game could kill someone .And ofcourse it would have just refreshed some memories of Koreans and would have caught attention of teens growing in digital era. Clear story : It gave us clear idea of the game ‚Ä¶It showed us what happens when someone breaks the rules ,what happens when participants wants to quit by majority .It showed us there was something beyond the games at the back . Twist : Marble game needs a shoutout .That game was so hard to watch .It shows how a person can betray against someone in a minute ‚Ä¶I mean all the twist and turn in the series were good . specially the last one . Set and costumes : No comments too good . Some of the things that hit me : I felt bad when Ali died .He was too innocent and also when female leads partner died in marble game . She had less lines but her character made such a huge impact. I felt bad when old man died too, I mean I felt bad for everyone except that thug but again he was just surviving there as well . I think main female lead didn't deserve that death .I mean she just cleared the round ,why did they had to explode thise glasses post that bridge game üò≠.She came too far and just died just like that . Atleast she trusted 456 .. that was an improvement but still ‚Ä¶. I felt bad for that annoying lady too ( I don't remember her name or number ,but you will get it ) .She was again trying to survive but she was too quick in changing sides .That was her survival trick but it show how showed her thr consequences of it in marble game. And ofcourse last but not least felt bad for that police.He went through all these just to let to get shot by his brother. I personally liked how they showed us the post life of 456 after winning money and didn't just stop with winning scenes. I felt bad for both the parents and that North Korean boy . And loved this line by old man ‚Äú do you still believe in humanity after going through all these"". Why I need season 2 : I want to know how front man ended up working for them .He was the winner of 2015 game ,he could have lived a good life but he was still renting room ‚Ä¶so there's more to it for sure . I wants to know what happened to the police since front man shot him on arm and I am sure he is alive . I want to know who is that person operating the cctv .He/she was removing the traces of that organ smuggling.If front man knew about it why delete it? I want to know who is gong yoo .He doesn't look like someone who is being controlled. I want to know how guards are trained ? They are few more thing that they blew mind .Post watching the show I was looking at some youtube comments and this particular details blew my mind .  Overall This shows us how human turn based on situation and are not trust worthy . It showed us how no one can live a life with guilt‚Ä¶ no matter how rich he is . It showed us all are having their share of sorrow . Whether it is rich or poor.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-your-opinion-about-the-new-series-on-Netflix-called-Squid-Game,"Squid Game' is a wonderfully violent Netflix binge-ride from hell. The brilliant idea of this survival K-drama shocks, but the razor-sharp script and engaging ensemble cast keep viewers interested.
Avoiding reading or viewing anything connected to Netflix's most current sensation Squid Game is the best approach to get started watching the smash-hit programme. If you've come to this page, it's a little ironic, but don't worry: this will be a spoiler-free review. Squid Game, which Netflix has dubbed ""perhaps their biggest programme ever,"" has blown the minds of millions of fans across the world since its debut. The internet is presently a minefield of spoilers; there are memes, conspiracy theories, rants, and ecstatic conversations about the Korean programme on every available online forum, and rightfully so. The nine episodes, written and directed by Hwang Dong-Hyuk, manage to leave viewers terrified but involved in the programme, owing to the show's razor-sharp script and riveting performances by its ensemble cast. In a nutshell, what is the concept of the survival K-drama? We follow 456 indebted competitors as they play in a variety of kid's games for a huge financial reward. The participants, on the other hand, quickly learn that the stakes are high, and that when the organizers say ""elimination,"" they mean it literally.

Squid Game,What message do you think Squid Game tries to teach?,"First, a warning. This answer contains strong spoilers. And it's a little bit difficult. The drama's key message is a soft warning to financiers. A dramatized version of ""Capital in the 21st Century"" by Thomas Piketty.  When the old man O-Il-Nam spoke ‚Äògame buddy‚Äô, he meant that he had never cooperated or trusted anyone, regardless of interest, since he set off on his path to financial success. The old man must have been a man who ran only for money after suffering the unfair loss of his son and wife for money as a young man. The three figures (‚óã‚ñ≥‚ñ°) that appear frequently are related to ants. Pink operatives are divided into workers, soldiers, and managers, which are the ranks in the ant or bee society. If we arrange the three figures in a line like this, ‚óã
‚ñ≥
‚ñ°  It symbolizes the ant's torso. I think that director Hwang puts a critical sense of the culture that emphasizes diligence in that he portrays the pink facilitators as an ant society. I think it contains his view that 'it is a culture induced by financiers' or that workers will live like ants by financiers and eventually lose humanity. Sung Ki-hoon is assumed as a laid-off worker at Ssangyong Motors.  The Ssangyong Motors case was the first major case of mass layoffs of workers, done by financiers in South Korea. The director who wrote the script said that the first draft was written in 2009, and, the strike and dismissal of Ssangyong Motors occurred that year. In Dalgona game, Sung Ki-hoon saves many people. Those who were at risk of dropping out because it was also the slowest. how? It was hard licking. But first, he saw it through the sun light. The important thing is that he lifted his head and looked at the sky and tried to get the sun's help. This behavior means that he is not ordinary, especially in the East Asia and many ancient civilization as the sun is a sacred symbol of justice, so it is a setting that shows that he has not lost his orientation to justice for humanity and really important things.  Sung Ki-hoon's participant number is 456. 456 is middle position number of 123456789, and order is plain. This means that Sung Ki-hoon is ""nothing special, just an ordinary person"". Sang-woo's number is 218. It can be read in many ways in Korean, but it can be read in two-eighteen. In Korean, it is same sound with ‚ÄòThis fuxxing‚Äô. (‚ÄòEe sipal/ssibal‚Äô). Yes, it is a number that contains the intention of calling ‚Äòthis (inhumane) bastard‚Äô.  Sung Ki-hoon says this after being able to walk on two legs in the last squid game. ‚ÄúThere was a saying when we were able to walk. It was, Am-haeng-eo-sa‚Äô. This suggests that he will be the executor of justice from his former sloppy look. Am-haeng-eo-sa is an official sent by the king in the Joseon Dynasty to find and punish local corrupt and harassing officials. When the official revealed that he was Am-haeng-eo-sa(a secret investigator), he was given tremendous authority(Yes, in game, player can start to walk with all legs.), and bad officials and aides were terrified. This suggests that he will be the executor of justice from his previous sloppy look.  At the end of drama, Ki-hoon's saying, furious with ""How do you do that to people..."" suggests that in Season 2 will he severely punish those involved in the game. (He even gives up the road to reclaiming his daughter his all.) With this part, the game in Season 1 is consequently characterized as a snuff movie. A snuff movie is a movie that involves killing people. Situation which is similar with Nicholas Cage's '8mm' will depicted in Season 2. Actually, on the surface, this movie reminds me of 'Eyes Wide Shut' directed by Stanley Kubrick. But.. Squid Game is better in my view. Perhaps Sung Ki-hoon is not the main character as in season 2, but he will still play an important role. His declaring (‚Äú(I changed into) Am-hang-eosa.‚Äù) in last squid game, and dyeing his hair with a stimulating red hair meant 'Awakening' as an executor. And director Hwang was definitely influenced by '8mm', and the motive for collecting and watching the killing scenes there was also 'the unbearable boredom of a rich man'.  To Seong-Gi-hun, An ordinary person who worries about a sick Saebyeok (It means ‚Äòdawn‚Äô.) and warmly approaches her, Sang-woo mocked him as an idiot, and in the end, shows the direction to take advantage of himself by killing weak girl mercilessly. The girl character implies North Korea, and it depicts the relationship between those who have sympathy for the pitiful people of North Korea and the part of South Korea that want to ‚Äúremove‚Äù them or let them die in starvation to pursue interests.  The infiltrating detective did not die. It will play an important role in season 2. (Some say that the Saebyeok is not dead, but that's probably not the case.)  The death scene of the old man is like looking at the dolls and their set. This is connected to the 'Fly me to the Moon' scene in which the puppets perform, which the frontman hears in between. The intention of the director about that is still unclear to me yet. (Add. It means ‚ÄúYou may be another VIP.‚Äù) ",https://www.quora.com/What-message-do-you-think-Squid-Game-tries-to-teach,FOR SQUƒ∞D GAME PRODUCTS https://dw-gear.creator-spring.com/,,,,
Squid Game,Is the Korean drama Squid Game (2021) worth watching?,"Yes . This thriller/action survival competition kdrama has recently taken Netflix by storm and it does live up to its hype. I am proud of this Korean show for becoming the most streamed show in Netflix US where English shows usually dominate. It really goes to prove Bong Joon-ho‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄúOnce you overcome the one-inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.‚Äù  Squid Game  is definitely worth watching for the following reasons: Underlying Message: Similar to  Parasite , the drama contains plenty of satirical messages upon closer look. The rich and bored people controlling the helpless and poor game participants can be reflected in today‚Äôs society. We see the rich using their power to control the powerless and unfortunate. The contrasting green and red colors also create a power dynamic. It also shows how the poor are left to fight among themselves while the rich are seemingly unbothered, almost as if they live in a whole other world. Near the end of the drama, the old man‚Äôs (Oh Il-Nam/Player 001) true identity is revealed. When he bets with the protagonist on whether anyone will help the homeless man struggling, the old man loses the bet as people come to assist. This final age old question of whether humanity is good or bad is touched upon. Then, we are reminded by all the greed and betrayal that cost contestants their lives throughout the game. It is ultimately left to us viewers to decide. Many of the actions and consequences in the drama make you think deeper into what the writer and producer is actually trying to convey.  Characterization: The characters are all very diverse. Some evil. Some kind hearted. One thing the contestants have in common is that they have little to live for and are in need of money. You would not expect such people to collide but when they do, the dynamic is quite interesting. When certain characters are killed off, it is hard to not feel sorry for them. Even the people in red jumpsuits have personalities. They do not simply comply with orders in a rigid manner. The writers put the perfect number of twists for each of the characters.  Mood Juxtaposition: The intentional brightly colored set and nostalgic games juxtaposes with the cruel deaths for a majority of participants. This creates a creepy feeling of never ending suspense. Throughout the show, the setting is always bright pastel or neon. The incorporation of childhood Korean games such as red light, green light, eating honeycomb/dalgona, tug of war, and marbles provide a sense of comfort. However, the contestants are really anything but safe.  *On a side note, the acting in this drama was phenomenal. When it comes to non-idol dramas, the actors tend to be very underrated. I wish Gong Yoo (game invitation giver) had a bigger part especially considering how popular he is/was. He would bring even more attention to the show, which has so many characters to the point where it is difficult to focus on a single person. Without a doubt, Gong Yoo would also be of great help in terms of promotions. I know many people are busy with testing right now. If you are in a time crunch, I recommend reading this  summary  or watching this  YouTube video  as a last resort.  Squid Game  is truly a kdrama that cannot be missed.",https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Korean-drama-Squid-Game-2021-worth-watching,"""The incorporation of childhood Korean games such as red light, green light, eating honeycomb/dalgona, tug of war, and marbles provide a sense of comfort. However, the contestants are really anything but safe."" I totally agree. The irony of people being killed over trivial things such as playing child games is the reason why the movie feels incredibly suspenseful.","Are HyperCube, The Platform, and Black Mirror much better than the Squid Game?","Train to Busan: great movie. There‚Äôs another Korean zombie film, teenager in high rise apartment, trapped by himself and contacts a female from across the complex. They manage to get out. Both great films.",*deep breath* ALI DID NOT DESERVE TO DIE!,"On subtitles: I can‚Äôt be sure about the USA, but in the UK it was available with English, French, Hindi and Polish dubbing - no subtitles needed."
Squid Game,Why is the Korean drama Squid Game very popular?,üö® SPOILER ALERT üö® Squid game became very popular global wide in just two weeks after releasing in Netflix. There are many reasons why this series is such a hit. The basic connection everyone could feel is the financial problems we have and what we could do to win some money. The cruelty of the games is definitely one of the reasons but there important detail is that the cruelty comes from the childhood games we played. This is not just for Korean kids the games are similar worldwide. I‚Äôm from india and we had played similar games. The well executed screenplay with no confusion in the simple storyline the director wrote. The scenes are crisp and does not feel boring at any point. The characters are written very well that every single one has different stories and attitude. Takeaway from this is different people act in different number of ways to survive or to get the money. Games made it easy for us to watch the series without getting bored. The majority of the run time is about the games and the survival which created a tension in the viewers. Sentimental and emotional connection. The story of each main lead is shown and everyone has a valid reason which makes us feel that ‚ÄúYeah He/She should be winning‚Äù. Even for that thug in the players he might acted cruel but he‚Äôs no different to others. In real i think 350/500 would be cruel anyway at some point. There are some more details and stories to be addressed in the show which I‚Äôm hoping will be cleared in the next season like Why did the front man come back to manage the games after winning 2015 games? How are the staff selected and trained? Who are the VIPs and why and how are they involved? What happened to police? (He was shot in the arm he‚Äôs definitely alive) Did the backup come to the place and busted the whole place? Did they find out and stopped the cruelty or will the games continue in the future?,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Korean-drama-Squid-Game-very-popular,For the last question the backup didn‚Äôt come or they probably did and got killed because the game by the end was still ‚Äúgoing‚Äù also about the question ‚Äúhow are the staff selected‚Äù my theory is when the people pick a card and they pick blue they probably were choose to be staff but the reds were players. I‚Äôm not sure tho these are theories. üòáüëç,,,,
Squid Game,What does the Squid Game ending mean?,"In order to understand the ending to  Squid Game  you have to keep one important incident in mind that happened a few episodes earlier. Several guards were running a black market organ selling ring, taking the organs of deceased players and selling them by boat. In order to facilitate this, they were using a doctor who participated in the game. And to make sure the doctor survived, they would tell him what the upcoming games were. However the scheme was uncovered and all of its participants were executed for giving one player an unfair advantage. This incident is vital to understanding the ending of the show.  At the end of the game player 456 receives a card asking him to meet at a penthouse where he discovers his best friend in the game, player 001, is still alive. Player 001 was supposed to have died in round 4, the marble game. It immediately becomes apparent that Player 001 was, in fact, the host of the game. Player 001 explains that he and his friends were simply bored and wanted to have some fun. And so they created the game. From their perspective there is nothing deeper to it than that. A game where hundreds of people are slaughtered was just a way to amuse themselves. It is monstrously sociopathic. As I have said elsewhere  Squid Game  is about capitalism. And the show‚Äôs ending is where we get the full, unmasked perspective of the capitalist class. The wealthy are just bored monsters playing with people‚Äôs lives. Player 001 justifies his monstrous actions two different ways. The first is that the players could, technically, quit any time they wanted to. This ignores that the players were specifically chosen because they actually didn‚Äôt have the option to quit. Their lives were so unlivable that the almost all chose to return. They could not quit any more than we can just quit capitalism. Capitalism will justify everything from labor violations to poisoning children‚Äôs toys with the concept that no one is holding a gun to people‚Äôs heads. Except they actually are. Food, shelter, heat, clothes, healthcare‚Ä¶ everything that we need just to live is tied to our ability to get money. Yes, there is, in fact, a gun to all of our heads and in America 54% of the population is living paycheck-to-paycheck. Or, as a more accurate summation, two weeks from death. No, the players couldn‚Äôt quit and neither can you.  The second is that humans are just bad people. What he did is no different than what everyone else does every day. To prove this point he makes one final bet with Player 456. There is a homeless man sitting on the street in the snow, and if no one stops to help him before midnight, then Player 001 wins. No one will help the homeless man because he is trash, beneath contempt. Just like the players in the game. Player 001 doesn‚Äôt believe the game is any different than what everyone does all day all the time. The career with the highest proportion of psychopathy is CEO. The wealthy are, in fact, not okay. Player 001 is projecting his own, very flawed, worldview onto society at large. And then, due to his wealth and power, created a miniature world were everyone is forced to act in ways as demented as his own thought processes. But  Squid Game  expressly refutes his base assumptions. As the minutes count down to midnight, someone does, in fact, come over and help the homeless man. When we are not operating in a system that forces us into sociopathy, we actually are kind, generous, considerate and altruistic. But Player 001 dies before seeing this happen. He is literally incapable of seeing human decency.  Remember what I said about the Doctor being executed for having an unfair advantage?  Squid Game  explicitly tells us the rules do not apply to the wealthy. The things you and I would be killed for are not even minor inconveniences for them. Player 001 knew every single game before the games even started. He could practice. He could research. And he was never going to die in any of them. Internet sleuths have uncovered he was never targeted by the Red Light Green Light computer. The guards who brutally executed every other player were never going to kill him, not in the honeycomb game nor in the marble game. The only game that carried a risk to him was the tug of war. The game where gave his team the optimal strategy. And even if they had really started to lose, something would have happened to save him. Player 001 was engaged in grandstanding poverty tourism. Playing a lethal game, but as the only one who doesn‚Äôt have to accept deadly consequences. The Doctor was killed for cheating, Player 001 cheated in the exact same manor but to a far more grand degree. But he‚Äôs a wealthy elite. So instead of death‚Ä¶ he just has his fun. And then when it is over he gets to peacefully die in his bed, under his expensive sheets. And never has to pay for his crimes, which is again, the murder of hundreds of people. The rules do not apply to the wealthy. But hey, he‚Äôs dead. The monster is dead. And that‚Äôs a good thing right?  When Player 456 is leaving for his flight to America, he sees the exact same man who inducted him into the game playing the same introductory game with another man. The game continues, despite the death of the game‚Äôs creator. Generally speaking social problems are painted as being the result of bad people. To fix everything we just have to get rid of the bad people. With the bad people gone, we can live exactly as we do now, only everything will be fine. The great lie of capitalism is individualism. Yes, we should get rid of the bad people. But the bad people were the product of a system that created them and gave them the power to be bad in the first place. Getting rid of any individual bad person, while not changing the system that let them be bad, is only going to result in a new group of bad people. The game continues, despite the death of the game‚Äôs creator. Player 001 was absolutely a monster, but he was simply a minor and replaceable part of a larger system. One that will continue on without him.  The ending of  Squid Game  is about the hell we are all trapped in. We are all at the mercy of a group of bored sociopaths, ones who think the whole world is a rotten as their own diseased souls. We follow rules that they would never subject themselves to. We listen to them whine as they justify the monstrous system they created that almost exclusively benefits them. And even when they are finally gone‚Ä¶ everything continues on exactly the same.",https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-Squid-Game-ending-mean,"Ah. Greek theatre, then. The point of Greek theatre was that it was a religious rite. The goal was to achieve catharsis. That was a little hard for us to understand, as Greek tragedies don‚Äôt seem cathartic in the sense we would understand. They just show a world where human beings are ultimately just food for powerful gods. What‚Äôs cathartic about that? Nothing, if you live in a better world. But perhaps those who get catharsis from  Squid Game  understand something about that world. That world‚Äôs experiencing something of a renaissance, I think.","If your country pays you to go to war, do you get judged as a war criminal? If your daughter is too good-looking, is it her fault if people take advantage of her? If money is reward of the evil deed, would you accept the full responsibility if you committed the crime, or do you fault a nameless group of people? To act unconsciously, is to be weak-willed! People who missed the point are in fact highly likely to be just the same. To lure out an evil in everyday unassuming people is this. It has happened since the first ever civilisation‚Ä¶ not just in today's world! Imagine how much evil there is in your world‚Ä¶ their evil is not obvious only because opportunities are not avail yet. This is why humans can be potentially dangerous until their morals are completely aligned with reasonable thinking.","In the tug of war game, he was the only player that didn‚Äôt have padlocks on his handcuffs. He could‚Äôve taken his handcuffs off anytime he wanted to- he wasn‚Äôt at risk of death in that game either.  Squid Game Viewers Have Spotted A Big Clue In The Tug Of War Game","Personally I found the ending unsatisfying, he hasn't seen his daughter for a year and in an instant decides- Ahh screw this meeting with my daughter, I'm gonna throw myself back into that maelstrom of slaughter where I have a tiny chance of survival just so I can ‚Äòstick it to the man‚Äô. Episode one established that 456 was a good, if flawed, man who truly loved his daughter. Yet in the final episode he decides in an instant to let her down, it just doesn't add up to me.","In virtually all of human history people lived ‚Äúfrom paycheck to paycheck‚Äù, having to starve themselves if the ‚Äúpaycheck‚Äù wasn‚Äôt good enough - and to push the argument further, the same rule applies in the animal kingdom. Linking that to capitalism seems excessive. I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre claiming that the players could not quit the game because their lives were too ‚Äúunlivable‚Äù either; not all players came back after the first stoppage of the game (they even gave the percentage of people who left in the dialogue), and the variety of backgrounds the characters had defeats that idea. Hardened criminals were there due to greed, others came out of necessity, others for fun... There‚Äôs a bit more complexity to it than ‚Äúthese poor guys had no choice‚Äù. Amusingly, ‚Äúchoice‚Äù is a theme in almost all of the games. I also think you‚Äôre over-interpreting the signification of the host, the prisoner 001. He was the oldest and physically the weakest prisoner, he wasn‚Äôt protected by the guards during the night fights, he helped his team succeed in the tug-o-war game (he didn‚Äôt have to) and he let the main character live despite having the possibility to let him die in the fourth game (he didn‚Äôt have to, either). Simplifying his character into ‚Äúthe rich are above law‚Äù is a bit inappropriate."
Squid Game,Is the Squid Game appropriate for kids age 12-15?,"From what I understand reading about this, seems ""not appropriate "" for adults, either! Maybe needs rating change to X? In addition to the EXTREME VIOLENCE!!!, the other huge problem is it seems to preach to viewers that society's storyline of ""you can work hard and get ahead"", or ""with education you get ahead faster"" or ""you can work smart, follow strategies of the rich and get ahead faster and successfully""‚Äî- these are all an illusion and the watching of people try these methods are mere sport for the wealthy. That is a very depressing point to sell teens show after show who may be university -bound in 1‚Äì3 years! WARNING: Watching a show like this may lead to depressed kids and teens, and possibly by preaching ""hopelessness"", may encourage suicides! Kids and teen brains do not have the life experience to fully process this content. Do adults even? In uncertain economic times, during a global pandemic, this might not be the best time to preach ""hopelessness."" Is there ever a good time? Garbage in = garbage out. What people see affects them subconsciously. I am not a fan of ""desensitizing"" kids and teens to violence, or preaching at them ""your life will suck no matter what you try, and then you die"". Both are brainwashing. Frontal cortex of brains, the part responsible for smart decision making and function, does not fully develop until 23‚Äì25 years old. Females brains ""grow up"" faster than males. Depressed, disillusioned people are easier for dictator ""saviors"" to falsely influence people, take over government and countries. Study pre-Hitler Germany or look at the mass followers of Trump who thought he would rescue them from depressing lives.

Squid Game,"Is the Korean drama ""Squid Game"" overrated?","  I watched Squid Game, and I have to say, I‚Äôm actually impressed with how they did it. It‚Äôs not anything new in particular; however, they did a great job re-making an already made concept, by adding their own twists and turns to it. It‚Äôs really well-made, the writing is great, and the character arcs as also amazing. But I have to say, it‚Äôs sudden popularity has got me wondering; ‚ÄúWhat does Squid Game have that no other tv series have??‚Äù Netflix‚Äôs CEO said that Squid Game might be their most-watched tv show, and in international Netflix shows, it takes Money Heist‚Äôs crown for first place. which is completely astounding to me. It‚Äôs a good show. Not bad at all. However, yeah, the hype for it is pretty strange, especially to me. But you should watch it if you haven‚Äôt. It isn‚Äôt inappropriate, except for this one scene, and there is quite a bit of violence and gore. However, it‚Äôs a good series nonetheless.",https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Korean-drama-Squid-Game-overrated,I still haven‚Äôt watched this. As you said the concept has been done to death so I haven‚Äôt exactly rushed out to watch it. I will eventually check it out I guess.,"I have watched it and was good, but now I moved on to other movies. I do not understand the hype it is receiving. Like people never saw horror movies, but there are so much better once. (Can this be classified as horror? )","I‚Äôm also shocked about the insane amount of hype it‚Äôs received. It‚Äôs also literally everywhere. Literally every type of YouTuber I watch (vloggers, gamers, reviewers, commentators, etc.) mention it in one way or another. Not to mention how the games seem to be trends now. About the concept through, they did start writing the script back in 2008 so I‚Äôd give it a pass.","I wasn‚Äôt interested at all with the hype, yet I still couldn‚Äôt ignore it when partner was watching it in the background. It is an overdone premise, but considering its script was written more than 10 years ago (2009 if I got it right) I‚Äôd give it a big pass. The music, tension and end twist is what made it really compelling for me.",I am half way through the show. Yay! But why is it called a Squid game?
Squid Game,Should I let my 10-year-old son watch Squid Games?,"It is a very violent show. All I have to say is when you hear in the news about kids anywhere from 7 yrs old to as young as 1 1/2 yrs old, 18 months, who get their hands on a loaded gun in the house and pull the trigger they are overwhelmingly boys. Like 98% (guessing). There have been 4 or 5 cases recently and all boys. This is something I have noticed for yrs. And I don‚Äôt think it is a genetic defect. It is being fed a constant diet of males pulling the trigger. There was a case, 5 kids, 4 of them girls, one boy, 3 loaded guns stash around the apt. all the kids knew where they were. Guess what gendered took the gun and shot? I‚Äôm saying the visuals of male violence has an impact And video games! Hrs days, with little brothers looking on.

Squid Game,Can a 12 year old watch Squid Game?,"IMDB parent guide or the website common sense media can be useful when trying to know if a child of a specific age should watch this or that.  There is a lot of series that are rated for older than 12 but depends on the maturity of the kid.
Squid game is different though, too graphic in violence and sex to be ok for a 12yo to watch (even one advanced in maturity). 
I understand the interest though, at their age I wanted to watch Battle Royale (wanted to read the manga too) there‚Äôs is something attractive about these concepts of Battle Royale. Hence Fortnite being attractive for this age range as well because they‚Äôre using this same concept. And Squid game or Alice in borderland, are attractive because of that",https://www.quora.com/Can-a-12-year-old-watch-Squid-Game,,,,,
Squid Game,Why is the squid game so popular outside of South Korea?,"Well, I think the actors did a good job and that's probably why viewers didn't press the change button in the first few minutes. But, of course, it takes quite a while to feel the acting, so there must be a reason why it binds capricious viewers to TV set more than that. This is my very minority opinion, but I think it's because their face shape is unique.   The face shapes of the actors/actresses are typical Korean faces and are different from the typical face shapes viewers see on Netflix. As you know, Europeans, North Americans, South Americans, Indians and West Asians all have double eyelids and high noses, but the actors in Squid Game don't. If you watch it for a few minutes with such freshness, you will feel that the actors are good at acting. After that, you will fall into the story itself. Yes, but this is a superficial reason after all. The director, Donghyuk Hwang, is a director who always makes very moving films well about a social issue. ‚ÄòSilenced‚Äô, a film that dramatized the human rights violations that take place in an orphanage, has already caused a big sensation in South Korea, and across Asia in some level. The movie shook the legislative branch, the judiciary, and the government, in South Korean society, and even the lead actor Gong Yoo (the actor who appeared as a cameo at the beginning of the Squid Game and plays the game by slap the lead actor) said that it was painful because he thought his career would end as the main character of the movie because the movie was too influential. (Gong Yoo is descendant of Confucius.)   In the end, it's like a combination of the director's ability and the actors' acting skills. Oh, I should mention the art and design of set, and the good camera work. (+ And music. Music director of ‚ÄòSquid Game‚Äô is the person of ‚ÄòParasite‚Äô.)",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-squid-game-so-popular-outside-of-South-Korea,,,,,
Squid Game,What do you think of the Squid game?,"The central theme of the show is a very simple question:  how far will you go for 45.6 billion won? That‚Äôs little over  38 million USD . You know how much money the average person with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree makes in an entire  lifetime?   1.8 million USD . You know how much money it cost to send Jeff Bezos to space for just 4 minutes?  5.5 billion USD . You know how much Evergrande owes its creditors?  300 billion USD . Which is still  less than half  of what Lehman Brothers owed prior to its bankruptcy. When you look at these figures from a calm, rational position, you could see the futility of joining the Squid Game. It's all hopeless. But sometimes life doesn't give you a choice. Either you join the rat race, or go back to a pathetic, meagre existence running from debt collectors, without any purpose or dignity, ashamed to even show yourself to your family and friends.  Out of all the characters in the show, this guy (forgot his name) is the one I could most relate to. Like him, I was once the pride of my small, grassroots community. Like him, I graduated from the best university in my area. Like him, I fell on hard times, and had to pretend I was happy and financially stable so as to not worry my parents. I took on all kinds of jobs to get by, and worked hard at every single one, at a great cost to my physical and mental health. I still suffer from gut problems to this day as a result of chronic stress, but at least I‚Äôm not one of the  745,000 people who die every year due to overwork . Dying for a salary that barely covers rent - I guess the Squid Game with its promise of 38 mil for the last man standing doesn't seem so bad after all. Overall, the show is another fine addition to the collection of class-conscious media that we've been seeing more of in recent years.  It's well-paced, extremely well-acted, and still believable in spite of some of its more ridiculous premises. The plot is similar to a lot of other ""Battle Royale"" type movies, but the bizarre setting and the characters themselves are more than enough to keep you entertained throughout the season. Absolutely enjoyable, even if leftist thoughts are not your thing. I highly recommend it. A2A  Cherry Chow (Âë®Ê∑≥Èà∫)",https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-the-Squid-game,"While I understand why you would relate to Sang-Woon, you‚Äôre forgetting a key nuance:  He ended up in the game  solely  due to his own corruption. Cho Sang-Woo did  not  lose his job, have his salary withheld, get crippled in an accident or sickened by illness, much less be saddled with children and parents to provide for. Rather, he embezzled and lost money, becoming a wanted man for white-collar crimes. As Seong Gi-Hun said, while he himself was always just a loser, Sang-Woo was supposed to be the golden boy of his neighbourhood, only to end up in shit all the same. His ruthlessness was  not  a human being‚Äôs survival instinct pushed to the extremes, it was the same greed and selfishness that got him into this mess  in the first place.  As far as we know, he had  zero  extenuating circumstances or reasons-Like the gangster, he‚Äôs just a bad man.

Squid Game,Should I let my 12-year-old watch the Squid game?,"Depends a lot on the kid. It‚Äôs a horrifying series built around an evil premise and full of extreme violence and death. That worries me a lot more than the predatory gay scene turn-around. I watched it. I‚Äôm 79, a clinical psychologist and former hospital priest and parish pastor and I‚Äôve seen a  lot , and I‚Äôm still disturbed by the series, even as I type this. Still, it‚Äôs an important piece of literature, in line to be Netflix‚Äô biggest ever, with dubbing and subtitles in 37 languages. I‚Äôd have to say watch it yourself, alone, all the way through, and if you think it‚Äôs going to be good for your kid in some way, watch it again, with them, and be sure to discuss it after each episode. That‚Äôs a lot of effort for you just so your kid and see the series, but I can‚Äôt think of any easy way to do it.",https://www.quora.com/Should-I-let-my-12-year-old-watch-the-Squid-game,"I (late sixties female religious) have been trying to decide to watch it or not, and I really don‚Äôt know which way to go.

Is there a particular social or artistic reason in favor of an adult watching it?","Yea‚Ä¶ not knowing how graphic the content was, I watched it with my 12-year-old sibling. Of course, had to skip a few scenes as well. Strangely enough, Dr. McPhee, it wasn‚Äôt all that of a shock to her; turns out, many people her age are watching it (by themselves, even); they would talk about it in class and all found it grimly entertaining.","I would personally say, hell, no! Let me start by saying I LOVE Squid Games! I have 2 episodes left to go and I can‚Äôt wait - I think it‚Äôs a fantastic series. But it‚Äôs for adults - it deals with adult themes and there are a lot of scenes of people getting killed in very cold blooded ways. Among other things there are scenes of rich people getting a kick out of seeing people die (though not quite as gory as Hostel). I would say this really isn‚Äôt a series for 12 year olds to be watching. I have a ten year old and she certainly won‚Äôt be allowed to watch it until she‚Äôs old enough for it not to give her nightmares, which could take a few years.",Totally depends on your child.

Squid Game,Who is the frontman in ‚ÄúSquid Game‚Äù?,"[Disclaimer. It contains spoilers.] He was a participant six years ago. (The current time in the squid game is 2020.) And he won the game that year. Each year, the game lasts only about 10 days, except for that period, where he lives in a collective house in Seoul. The house he lives in is a characteristic Korean collective house called Gosiwon. It is home to the people who want to cut off from society to prepare for certain difficult exams mainly, and office workers who are temporarily on long-term business trips, and the poorest single living. The room is about 2 meters wide on one side and there are often no windows. He is not interested in spending wealth though he is not poor man. He spends most of his time reading philosophy books. Jacques Lacan a French Neo-Freud theorist, F. Nietzsche a German philosopher who insisted human‚Äôs will over God, etc. In his room there is a painting of Rene Magritte, a famous surrealism Danish painter. (And painting book of Dutch Van Gogh also placed.)  After winning the contest, he became the chief facilitator, either at offer to him or at his own will. Astonishingly, his former occupation was a police officer. And he was a sincere policemen who influenced to his younger brother, and his younger brother also became a policemen. It wasn't revealed in Season 1 as to why he changed so much, or why he was forced to join the game as a person who was a cop. This season's director Hwang Dong-hyuk said story of frontman and the suit guy of subway platform, will be revealed in season two. From the books he read in his room and from his actions, it is highly probable that he is a psycho. However, given the appearance he saw when he shot his loving younger brother, he is most likely normal, and perhaps he is an individual with a motive to infiltrate the organization, uncover structure and motivation, and destroy it.

Squid Game,What could season 2 of the Squid Game look like?,Probably. Since the Protag appeared to want to challenge the game makers again. It ended on that cliff hanger. Some people felt the doctor character was unnecessary. But his death gave the writers to propose a false narrative. That the games were about equality and egalitarianism. People succeed based on their abilities and luck. So they killed him to teach everyone that lesson. This explanation may or may not be true. And if it is true. Its not the only reason why the games are being held. We eventually meet the organizer of the games. And he explains his reasoning and rationale. He argues that excessively rich people and poor people have one thing in common. That they are bored and have little reason to keep living. That when you become as rich as him. You purchase everything you want and having enjoyed everything. You have nothing left to desire. Making the world very dull. So thats why he introduced the games. Because the only thing left that could entertain him was watching people snuff each other out. The protag clearly hates this answer. And intended to kill him. Another thing about the game developer was that he claimed the funnest time he ever had in his life was when he was a little kid playing games with friends. He never felt that same kind of excitement again. Which is why he decided to participate in the games himself before he died. To play a death game with all of the contestants. Im not sure if death was ever a possibility for him though. Since he was the game‚Äôs organizer. Id imagine there was orders to make sure. He would never be a target. Its hard to say. He clears his own conscious by giving everyone a choice. He gives everyone the choice to play by having them consent to the games. When people tried to revoke. He even voted to free everyone from the games when there was a split consensus. But he lures them back in by promising them huge riches if they try to complete the games. He targets the dregs of society. People who feel like they have nothing to lose. Usually those who are incredibly in debt. And need money for various reasons. Personally. No amount of money is worth your life. But if there was anyone who felt different about that. He lures them into his games.  ,https://www.quora.com/What-could-season-2-of-the-Squid-Game-look-like,,,,,

Squid Game,"Which K-pop idols would win in the ""Squid Game"" Korean drama?","Realistically: none of them. 456 people played that game, and almost all of them died. However, if any idol could survive the squid games, I‚Äôd put my money on: RM (BTS):  Strengths : This man is smart,  extremely  smart. He has a tested IQ of 148. That might not translate directly into survival skills, but he‚Äôd be one of the people most likely to stay calm during an intense situation, or think his way out of a problem. In addition, he‚Äôs quite physically strong as well. In hand-to-hand combat, he has an advantage because of his height. (he‚Äôs also got arms as well) Weaknesses : He‚Äôs too compassionate. No, seriously. To survive the games, you have to be ruthless. You have to be willing to let other people die, or even kill other competitors. I honestly couldn‚Äôt see Namjoon killing anyone in cold blood. He‚Äôs way too empathetic; he‚Äôd start feeling guilt even before hurting them. Maybe he could kill someone to defend a person he cared a lot about, but otherwise, he won‚Äôt. He‚Äôs also super clumsy. He‚Äôd probably break the honeycomb by accident in the second game, and die.  Somi (I.O.I):  Strengths: Somi has a 3rd degree black belt in taekwondo. She‚Äôs pretty badass. Just look:  She‚Äôs really athletic, and could take out other competitors easily. Plus, she would be able to survive the more physically demanding games, especially the ending. In addition, I think that people might underestimate Somi because of her face and the aura that she gives off. She‚Äôs not outwardly intimidating, so I think she might slip by a lot of people‚Äôs attention. Weaknesses: Since she said she can be scared by creepy things, I think she might get really shaken if someone got killed in front of her. She also has the potential to be manipulated or tricked.  In conclusion:  none of the idols would be in Squid Game purely because they wouldn‚Äôt fit the criteria to be a candidate in the first place.

The rules are simple. Children are divided into two groups, the offense and the defense. Once the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet in bounds, while the offense outside the lines are only allowed to hop on one foot. But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid past the defense, they are given the freedom to use both feet. [...] We called that ‚Äòinspector royale.‚Äô When we were ready for the final battle, the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid. In order to win, the attackers must tap the small closed off space on the squid‚Äôs head with their foot. But if someone on the defense manages to push you outside the squid‚Äôs boundary, you die. [...] Once you tap the squid‚Äôs head, you win and yell out, ‚ÄòVictory.‚Äô Of course, the game isn‚Äôt really played like this in the series. It‚Äôs just a tad bit more murdery there.

At each step the panes are randomized, and the players have no way of knowing which is which until they jump on one. Each step is essentially a 50/50 guess, and all 18 steps must be crossed in order. It's not all luck though. The 16 players must cross the bridge one at a time, and they get to choose what order they play in. Each player gets to observe the progress of all those who went before them, meaning they can memorize which panes have been stepped on and which ones broke. However you don't necessarily want to go last either. The game has a time limit shared by all players and if you haven't crossed by the end of the timer you will still lose. Ideally you'd want to be the first one across. (In the show they can also push each other, but for the purposes of math let's ignore that) Given this knowledge, what's the best position to choose in order to have the best chances of being the first one to safely cross the bridge?",https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-beat-the-squid-game,"That‚Äôs not the ‚Äúsquid game.‚Äù It‚Äôs one of the games in the story, but the Squid game was explained in the first two minutes and was the final game played by two players at the end.",,,,
Squid Game,How would each 16 MBTI type fare in the Squid Game?,"If you're in Squid Game, we can assume you're an unhealthy version of your type; so, we can reference every negative stereotype of each type to see how they'd fare in Squid Game. IMO, Unhealthy ENTJs, ENTPs, INTJs, ENFJs and ESTPs probably stand the best chance. Manipulation, Intimidation, Strategizing, and Impulse Thinking (the skills I feel give you an advantage in the game) come more naturally to these types. (Strategizing for the TJ types; Manipulation for the ENFJs and tertiary Fe users; Intimidation for the ENTJ, INTJ, and ESTP.)",https://thembti.quora.com/How-would-each-16-MBTI-type-fare-in-the-Squid-Game,"What about an unhealthy Infj? Yes we have feeling in front of thinking but if we‚Äôre unhealthy the feeling (at least for me) will get thrown out the window ü™ü. With infjs we‚Äôre really 50/50 with feeling and thinking. I think we would observe everyone, and see how each player is and choose the best of the best to acquire what we need. Our manipulation game is quite strong üòÖü§£",,,,

Squid Game,Is Squid Game a real game?,"Yes, Squid Game is a real children‚Äôs game that was played in Korea during the 1970s and 1980s. Squid Game is described as a type of game similar to Capture the Flag or Red Rover, where the opposing attack and defense teams play within a squid-shaped board which is usually drawn in the dirt. The official rules from the show were outlined at the beginning by Seong: ‚ÄúIn my town, we had a game called the ‚ÄúSquid Game.‚Äù We called it that because it‚Äôs played in a court shaped like a squid. The rules are simple. Children are divided into two groups, the offense, and the defense. Once the game starts, the defense can run around on two feet in bounds, while the offense outside the lines is only allowed to hop on one foot. But if an attacker cuts through the waist of the squid past the defense, they are given the freedom to use both feet. [‚Ä¶] We called that ‚Äòinspector royale.‚Äô When we were ready for the final battle, the attackers gathered at the entrance to the squid. In order to win, the attackers must tap the small closed-off space on the squid‚Äôs head with their foot. But if someone on the defense manages to push you outside the squid‚Äôs boundary, you die. [‚Ä¶] Once you tap the squid‚Äôs head, you win and yell out, ‚ÄòVictory.‚Äù . . <3",https://www.quora.com/Is-Squid-Game-a-real-game,,,,,

I can endure less food üç≤ because eating is not a hobby of mine and i would have survived anyways because they were providing enough for ones survival. About the team making , i would have chosen the good ones. In the tug of war , it would have been based on teamwork so i would have given it my best :) the marble one ( I am Hella good at playing marbles , we used to play with them as kids). Now( I forgot ) the midnight fight (ughhhhhhhhh) the only chance for me to survive through this one is either I stay with my teammates or hide somewhere among the dead :( and that would kind of suck so now 50% chance of survival stepping on the glass - I would have chosen the last second position my luck really helps me out but can‚Äôt say . so now 25% chances of survival.

Squid Game,Would you join The Squid Game if invited?,"If I got the invitation for going into the Squid Games, I would definitely go there as those games seem really easy to be honest. JUst use your brain and try to cheat. The only difference between the childhood games and the actual squid games is the consequences as well as the rewards are exponentially higher. Game 1 - I would stick to the rules and try not to panic when the others are dying. I know its different hypothetically and on field, but its very easy if you can control. Game 2 - Assuming none of the crap happens like the vent crawling and Seong Gi-Hun licking the shape, I would go for the easiest shape (i.e triangle) and observe how other people got the shape out and just follow them. ez Game 3 - Well its just basic tug-of-war. I can also use some techniques like :   Game 4 - Depends on my Partner, if it were someone like Ali or The Old Man, I would definitely try to pull of tricks and cheat with them. (ik this sounds rude but you gotta do what you gotta do for survival) Game 5 - Stick to your group - I could make friends with the glass maker and just follow his lead the whole game. And take the last vest because you are guranteed to win if you take the last one. Also I have a knowledge of glass and light so I‚Äôd try checking the reflections aswell. One more Big Brain tactic : Just get some shoes in your Jacket and throw them at the glass in front of you, as this game doesn‚Äôt have any rules, we can use any trick without the risk of elimination. Last Game : Well, this one sounds difficult but it requires strength and agility to pass, so I would choose the defender side, and just try to stab the attacker whenever he/she tries to get it.",https://www.quora.com/Would-you-join-The-Squid-Game-if-invited,"Just saying, while they might seem easy, it‚Äôs not that easy. Your life is on the line. One mess up, and you die. That puts a whole lot of pressure on you. Imagine playing something as easy as Rock Paper Scissors. Normally you just play it, and sometimes you could ‚Äútrick‚Äù your opponent and force them to play a certain hand and win. It‚Äôs all for fun. Now what if you lose, you die? You‚Äôre not going to be thinking straight. It‚Äôs not going to be a walk in the park because guess what, if you mess up, you die. Although we as viewers know what games they play, the actual players don‚Äôt. They went into everything fresh. Yes they played them as children in some form, but for the most part, when they arrived, they had no idea what games they were playing and what twists there were. So if a realistic sense, Itd make more sense if we as the viewers went, we would all have different games we weren‚Äôt aware of beforehand. About half the games are dependent on you to winning, and the other half is either teamwork, or going against another person. Let‚Äôs just say for example we use the current games from the show. Red Light, you can win that by yourself, granted no one pushes you or anything like that. Cookie game, again, it‚Äôs mostly dependent on you alone. Another ‚Äúgame‚Äù was the fact they allowed murder, unless you‚Äôre skilled against 50 other people, in the dark with flickering lights, good luck surviving. Games like tug of war is dependent on your team, not just you. You might be strong, but if the other team is stronger overall, or your team messes up even a little, you all die. Glass bridge, unless you‚Äôre a glass expert, you have a 50/50, per tile. And even if you are a glass expert, we saw what they did to counter that. All I‚Äôm saying is, it‚Äôs not that easy as you‚Äôre making it out to be.",,,,
Squid Game,Should I watch Squid game in English dub or Korean dub?,"TEENS TAKE ON WATCHING SQUID GAME IN ENGLISH DUB OR KOREAN DUB Honestly, I think you should watch it in korean dub. Since it isn‚Äôt like anime were you can watch it in dub and their mouths line up with what they are saying. It may annoy you if that‚Äôs something that you don‚Äôt like. Watching it in the korean dub will be a better experience since the actors will express more emotions since they are acting while the dub the VA‚Äôs are probably in a booth and won‚Äôt add that much emotion as the actual actors (it‚Äôs a possibility). Also since it was filmed in korean and it‚Äôs originally in korean, I just think it‚Äôs better to watch it in korean. I personally watched the first 3 episodes in dubbed and I wasn‚Äôt paying attention bcs it wasn‚Äôt that interesting but when I watched it in subbed it just seemed more interesting and I was paying more attention (it just got different somehow) but that could just be me.

Squid Game,Is Squid Game overrated?,"No. It has some very good story telling. The main character development is mainly well done where you invest and merge with an emotional connection. Other characters could have been developed slightly better and given a bit more back story. There are some powerfully disturbing scenes of dehumanisation where fiction meets a too real possibility‚Ä¶The What If it is true factor is well portrayed. The Tug o war scene and the marbles scene were the best‚Ä¶ such great content and the twists keeps you engaged in every moment. You want to know what happens all the way to the end. The ending sucked. It was rushed and not well developed compared to the rest of the episodes. Tying up loose ends could have been so much better, especially between the cop and his brother ‚Äî poorly done. The winner and his friend could have been so much better where you would care to have both live, but it was too rainbows and lollipops which was disappointing. The old man and the winner ‚Äî poorly done. The winner and his aftermath ‚Äî poorly done. The very ending ‚Äî poorly done. What was the meaning of the ending? Well this is how I see it‚Ä¶ The system in which they all live in takes advantage of the most vulnerable. Who are those vulnerable? It shows they come from all walks of life‚Ä¶ where the decisions they made saw them all in heavy debt. Elitist who make so much money their life becomes a bore without a dramatic heightened feeling of aliveness to get their kicks, there is a game devised that helps one billionaire try to re-create feeling so alive. As he shares it with other fellow elitist who don't want to be in it but to watch the realness of dehumanisation and feel alive because of it, he makes himself feel like he is more noble because he played in the game and has a deeper appreciation for how intricate it is. Of course it's such an expensive buy in exclusive novelty they really show just how fuckedup they all are, and end up just wanting to fuck the waiter and banter each other with so much emotional immaturity you wish someone put them in the game. The workers show a level of corruption, it's better to be a worker than a participant‚Ä¶and some take advantage of the bodies that are killed. Of course the moral of the story is ‚Äúit's rigged"" ‚Ä¶ the billionaire is never going to be mowed done with the rest of them. And he kept his ‚Äúhumanistic‚Äù qualities since he let them all vote and majority either stayed or could leave. When they came back they all knew what they were getting into. They are blamed for the impossible position they are in. Never the Elitist who placed them in the position through grooming them in their vulnerability using it against them, giving them a taste of what financial freedom could look like for one of them, knowing everyone else would die bar the old man himself. The old man's not fearing for his life, although there is some risk for him, it's very calculated. He is not in any Vulnerable position like the rest of them. He is protected the whole entire time, even when he is sick. Yet the relationship he develops with a group of underdogs gives him the fascade he is ‚Äúequal"" and it's a fair play ground of rules. When it isn't at all. But they get fed into this thinking. The ending where the brothers see each other shows how much a person can turn when they want to be a part of what an elitist has. They become cold hearted, Narcissitic just like them, however he isn't fully turned, and shows a reminesce of his humanity as he shoots his brother knowing the only chance of survival he will have is if he falls backwards into the sea. A way that he stays in power, and trys to give his brother a way out. You don't see a body come to the surface so you don't know if he's dead or alive. When the winner is led to the old man, the old man tries to reclaim his human dignity that he did right by the people, when clearly he's a cunt who used people as pawns to make his own live game that gave him the feelings of being alive ‚Äî oh poor lost billionaire, who can't think of any better ways to do it. His last breath is meant to give the winner some last wisdom of advice, to find meaning in everyone's death and make the money count. What Fucken irony huh. When the winner finally gets his wish to go to America and be reunited with his daughter who he hasn't seen for a long while and fulfil his promise to his belated mother, he instead gets a pang of rage and decides he wants to compete in the next games and go after those who create it. ‚ÄúWe are in the elitist SIM Game. Just because he won his physical and financial freedom, he did not win his psychological freedom ‚Äî it's a fallacy. He's tormented by the deaths of his peers and his good friend and what he had to do to win. He wants revenge which is unrealistic, especially on his own. The very wealthy will always have the position of power and continue to seek out and use the most Vulnerable. They are psychological labrats. Whatever the elitist say is worth the shit on their shoes, for it is them who have projected their loss of morals and values for humanity and sense of aliveness in those who have someone or something to keep living for, even though they are in a debt they can't get out of. The old man billionaire has everything and yet covets what the most Vulnerable bring to their table. Not even his fellow elitist can bring him what he needs to feel so alive. Many of us relate to the under dog‚Ä¶ and can see it's going to be a hopeless revenge, even though you want it so much, he will never be able to do it on his own. This is what is close to reality. This is why Squid game is number one in many countries on Netflix‚Ä¶and why I think it's not over rated.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Squid-Game-overrated,"I read it well. Thank you. I agree with everything, but I'm pointing out one point. Contrary to your view, there is no justification for billionaires, including the elderly. This is revealed in the sixth episode. Ji-yeong, who yields her life to North Korean defector Sae-byeok, said hosts took advantage of her despite her extremely miserable past. Specifically, she paid prison sentence for murdering her father who used to assault her mother and ‚óã‚óã‚óãed her, she said, and organizers came to her after her release.

Squid Game,How did the popularity of BTS pave the way for Netflix‚Äôs Squid Game?,"The idea that BTS paved the way for Squid Game' seems to be a minority opinion even among ARMYs. I‚Äôm thinking someone saw a twit implying it and it has a thousand likes and that person ran around carrying that narrative thinking that a thousand likes is representative of the roughly 40 Million fans/ followers of BTS in twt. Problem with locals are they are not used with how huge the ARMY fanbase is, and opinions of minority are often projected to the whole group. A twt with 1 million likes claiming BTS paved way for squid game may look huge but thats a small percentage of ARMYs only. I don't think BTS paved the way for Squid Game, but  maybe  some people think that way because in Korea BTS is considered the ‚Äòcenter' of the Hallyu Wave. Koreans are proud of how BTS is at the forefront of spreading Korean culture and media across the world. Even government officials claim that BTS contribution to spreading Korean culture is greater than any diplomat. Everyday there are news regarding economic studies showing that exportation of some products increased because a BTS member used it. There are studies that global interest towards hangul is increasing because of BTS, and before covid there are studies showing BTS accounts for a large portion of South Korea's tourism. BTS and Squid Game are both part of thebhallyu wave but they are very diverse. Maybe an ARMY who learned hangul and knows a bit about Korean culture will appreciate Squid Game more than a viewer who only relies on subtitles. Or maybe an ARMY who is interested with Korean culture will be more likely to watch it as compared to someone who doesn't want to watch a foreign series. Other than that we should realize Squid Game‚Äôs is a really good series that deserves worldwide recognition.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-popularity-of-BTS-pave-the-way-for-Netflix-s-Squid-Game,"BTS is the center of Korea.

Squid Game,"Why is the Netflix series ""The Squid Game"" so controversial?","Why is the Netflix series ""The Squid Game"" so controversial? I‚Äôve only heard of one specific controversy concerning the translations of the series, but I can imagine there are more out there. Some points about the show (spoilers ahead)‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about poor people playing games with their lives for the entertainment of rich people. It‚Äôs violent and gory The players are given an out, and actually leave the game after they realize what‚Äôs at stake, yet they return because they realize their lives are still as bleak as before. The amount of prize money depends on how many survivors there are. It pits family against family. In one case it‚Äôs a husband vs wife. In another, it‚Äôs brothers. The founder of the Squid Games gleefully plays the games as people around him are dying. He has a very real risk while playing, but is still spared when his time comes. While the game is supposed to be fair to all, a ‚Äúspecial game‚Äù is introduced outside of the normal, inciting and encouraging a free for all murder spree. Since this isn‚Äôt a game the players signed up for, it should have been just as illegal as some of the players getting advance notice of the next game. The founder even mentions this wasn‚Äôt his intention. The games requiring teams have very different reasons for those teams. In one, it‚Äôs the team working together, while in the next, it‚Äôs PvP. These team ups are required before knowing what the game is, and the players team up under certain assumptions. Some of the staff are harvesting organs from dead players to make extra money, but when the management finds out, their issue is with the fact they‚Äôve given the doctor player advance notice, not that they‚Äôre selling organs. The show depicts both a cynical view of human nature as well as a hopeful one. The message seems to be a bit muddled. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I really enjoyed the show. While it was reminiscent of ‚ÄúThe Hunger Games‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattle Royale‚Äù, there are some very important differences‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not strictly PvP, at least not for most of the games, although some players decide to be more proactive against their competition later on. The staff do most of the killing. Each player understands the consequences. They sign a contract freely, and are explained the rules quite clearly prior to the start of each game. In general, the games have very simple goals. Even before the first game, one of the players could simply have asked what ‚Äúelimination‚Äù meant. If you play the game by the rules, you win. Period. There are no hidden traps or surprises. They‚Äôre kids games, so the rules are simple. After the first game, the players decide to quit as per the rules given in the contracts they signed. They are sent home, but told they can start up the games again if they want. They want. The staff are held to a higher standard when dealing with the players. If they cheat or break the rules, they forfeit their lives also. There can be multiple winners who would split the prize evenly. However, there‚Äôs rarely any more than one survivor. When set beside ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù and ‚ÄúBattle Royal‚Äù, the morals are more ambiguous, while the plot makes a whole lot more sense (even if hundreds of desperately poor can disappear every year without raising SOME concern, or that some poor schmuck suddenly has nearly 40 million dollars in their bank account overnight). The controversy may lie in the fact that the morals of the story are ambiguous. On the one hand, you have a spectacle for the rich which involves the killing of the poor, but on the other hand, the players are given several options to opt out. They aren‚Äôt forced to play like the other two franchises (Battle Royale had a sequel). One last point of controversy may also be that some of the translations are not very accurate. I‚Äôve read several complaints on Reddit about how the subtitles were ‚Äúwatered down‚Äù and didn‚Äôt give the same meaning as the Korean. This was mostly noticed in the closed captioning, the system for those with hearing impairments, but also to a smaller degree in the Netflix subs and dubs. This would potentially decrease the impact, or make some scenes not as clear as intended. But, damn, that giant doll was freaky.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Netflix-series-The-Squid-Game-so-controversial,"It is a little too violent for me. I have chosen not to watch it. However, I have had at least 13 questions requested of me about Squid Games. I am just going to send them to you. Thanks for the recap.",It sounds too violent for my personal 'cup of tea'. I'm not saying it's too violent for everybody though because there are many who love those gory horror shows and get a kick out of them and I feel like they would probably like Squidd Game too. My grandson would love this show. He is thirty be and he finds these sort of stories really interesting and fun to watch. It seems to be in the Hunger Games genru. It certainly is popular right now. I like a happy ending and I don't see this one ending well at all. Lol ‚Äô,,,
Squid Game,What do people of South Korea think of the global success of ‚ÄúSquid Game‚Äù?,"It is true that we‚Äôre a little happy. And it's fun. This is because the South Korean drama, which is mainly based on our children's games, are gaining popularity. But those who have seen it in person are not so happy. Regarding the phenomenon, NBC News published the following analysis through the opinions of experts.  The gist of the article is that ""South Koreans tend to want to be number one in any field, but they're a little confused by how their dark side is portrayed."" But I think differently. In fact, we're not so embarrassed by the revealing of our dark side. If you watch it on YouTube, people who have been watching South Korea for a long time say this. ""The reason I like South Korea is that they don't mind revealing their dark side."". Yes, this observation has already come to light in the form of many questions in Quora. As South Koreans, we believe that our society can be normalized and developed only when we never stop, expose, confront it head-on and annihilate it. Popularity is short-lived, and the utility of a normalized society lasts much longer. We made this drama primarily for ourselves. The reason we feel dark after watching this drama is because it reflects reality so well. A lot of people point out the depiction of violence, but as I watched it, I felt, ""Actually, what was really terrible was the our reality itself rather than the violence."" We South Koreans are people with good empathy, and we have a shamanistic prediction ability that the situation of this drama will come in the near future. This is because we are a country where the priests of the ancient federation in the interior of Eurasia migrated in large scale when that country fell. In Eurasian shamanism, priests are people with a level of insight that appears to be mystical. From ‚ÄùTrain to Busan‚Äù, our filmmakers have asked endlessly, ‚ÄúWhat would you do in this situation?‚Äù. There are still many people like Sang-woo in our society, so we keep making films like this. Many of us will still be stuck in the pre-change phase, but it will work for some. We will continue to create stories like this until their numbers are large enough to guide our society in the right direction when it comes to make really important decisions. We are selfish. how? We made this drama for ourselves. We don't want to be another Sangwoo. If everyone behaves like him, we will perish together. Yes, some South Koreans may have been confused by the fact that they would be like Sangwoo. But that's a good sign. Because they have hope for change than those who don't feel it at all. Lastly, Gong Yoo is always present in the socially critical films of director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who made ‚ÄòSquid Game‚Äô. He is a symbol of socially critical films since director Hwang Dong-hyuk's 'Silenced', and at the same time maintains the image of a general entertainer of 'Goblin' in parallel. (He also starred in ‚ÄúTrain to Busan‚Äù.) By the way..  He is a direct descendant of the great Confucius.  I want the Chinese to improve their systems by themselves so that they can be as good as they did in ancient times. Just like their relative, Gong Yoo. Chinese brothers. Watch this drama a lot by any means, and think about how it should change.",https://www.quora.com/What-do-people-of-South-Korea-think-of-the-global-success-of-Squid-Game,The dark side aspect is silly to be mentioned by the article. It's not unique to Korea and every country will have people like that. Doesn't mean that Korea is worse off,"‚ÄúHe is a direct descendant of the great Confucius.‚Äù But how can this be? I was told by Internet Korean that no Korean shares any ties with anyone in China ever and that the two civilizations are 100% separate, and distinct that ‚ÄúLunar New Year‚Äù and ‚ÄúKorean Thanksgiving‚Äù are in no way derived directly from Chinese holidays that celebrate the same thing on the same day. Has Internet Korean been lying to me?","Most Sino-Korean last names are just ‚Äòbought‚Äô or ‚Äògiven‚Äô during the late Joseon, and that does not mean that they are related. Gong Yu is most likely not related at all, his ancestors were probably commoners who didn't have last names in Korea. This is the same for most ‚Äòforeign‚Äô last names, or very populous last names in Korea.",I don‚Äôt think he is a direct descendent. The Kong family has a well made family tree and the current descendent is a ping pong champion.,Are you talking about the Chinese government?
Squid Game,"What elements of Korean culture were put into ""Squid Game"" that Western audiences may not recognize?","My answer may be below that of Andi Roselund, who knows Korea better than me, a Korean, but I will write it. (It‚Äôs joke.) First, a warning. This answer contains strong spoilers.  Sung Ki-hoon is assumed as a laid-off worker at Ssangyong Motor.  The SsangYong Motor strike and mass layoffs were the first major events in which workers became mass-disposed in the interest of financial capital. The strike took place in 2009, and it was in 2009 when the first draft scenario was written by the director of the drama. Sang-woo's number is 218. It can be read in many ways in Korean, but it can be read in twe-eighteen. In Korean, it is same sound with ‚ÄòThis (fuxxing) bastard‚Äô. (‚ÄòEe sipal/ssibal (saekki)‚Äô). Yes, it is a number that contains the intention of calling ‚Äòthis (inhumane) bastard‚Äô.  Sung Ki-hoon says this after being able to walk on two legs in the last squid game. ‚ÄúThere was a saying when we were able to walk. It was, Am-haeng-eo-sa‚Äô. This suggests that he will be the executor of justice from his former sloppy look. Am-haeng-eo-sa is an official sent by the king in the Joseon Dynasty to find and punish local corrupt and harassing officials. When they revealed that he was Am-haeng-eo-sa(a secret investigator), he was given tremendous authority(Yes, in game, player can start to walk with all legs.), and bad officials and aides were terrified. This suggests that he will be the executor of justice from his previous sloppy look. To Seong-Gi-hun, An ordinary person who worries about a sick Saebyeok (It means ‚Äòdawn‚Äô.) and warmly approaches her, Sang-woo mocked him as an idiot, and in the end, shows the direction to take advantage of himself by killing weak girl mercilessly. The girl character implies North Korea, and it depicts the relationship between those who have sympathy for the pitiful people of North Korea and the part of South Korea that want to ‚Äúremove‚Äù them or let them die in starvation to pursue interests.

Squid Game,What can we learn from Netflix's Squid Games?,"Nothing. Squid Games is one of most overrated shows in history of Netflix.

Squid Game,Did Netflix‚Äôs Squid Game copy The Hunger Games plot?,"Maybe. Or it could have copied the plot of a similar movie from before The Hunger Games. Or it could have copied the plot from a similar movie after hunger games. It‚Äôs difficult to tell a director/producer‚Äôs motives. Personally, I see very few similarities between  Hunger Games  and  Squid Games , besides the word ‚Äúgame‚Äù in the title. Hunger Games is a ‚Äúbattle royale‚Äù sort of situation, which could date back to professional wrestling or even the middle age melee tournaments. I imagine gladiators did something similar. Squid Games is a series of different games, more like an elimination triathlon or Olympics. Also, Hunger Games was government sanctioned, Squid Games was clearly an underground illegal operation. One of the other answers mentioned the Japanese movie (I think it‚Äôs Japanese)  Battle Royale  and while I haven‚Äôt seen it, that one might be closer‚Ä¶ although wikipedia is telling me that the fighting is government sanctioned in that movie too (I haven‚Äôt gotten around to watching it yet). There‚Äôs a long history of secret martial arts competitions on remote islands so I imagine those might have played some role in the inspirations for Squid Games Personally, I would place Squid Game more in the ‚Äúescape‚Äù or ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù room genre, largely because of the series of games and puzzles the contestants need to figure out. I‚Äôm not entirely certain where those trace back to‚Ä¶  Cube  (1997) is the oldest and closest I can think of in this instance. In that movie, a group of different people were kidnapped and taken to some secret facility and put inside a massive puzzle/maze with deadly traps. It‚Äôs never specified if this is a government program or a secret private research company or what, but they are certainly being watched and analyzed by someone. But there have been countless escape room movies since then (not many good enough to remember by name). There‚Äôs also  $lasher$  (2001). That might be a good bet. In $lasher$, there is a televised game show where a group of contestants compete in a maze against three professional ‚Äúserial killers‚Äù who are trying to kill them. The contestants can work together and share the prize money or kill each other to make for a bigger individual prize, there are a variety of different rooms with different opportunities and challenges for defense against the bad guys and, of course, the who thing is being watched and ratings are important. There are no games or puzzles but it‚Äôs a similar setup. I suppose I‚Äôll go with an interesting combination of $lasher$ and Cube, with maybe some Battle Royale thrown in (I suppose I should get around to watching that movie so I would know for sure). Not Hunger Games, though. 8 )",https://www.quora.com/Did-Netflix-s-Squid-Game-copy-The-Hunger-Games-plot,,,,,
Squid Game,What is squid game?," Squid Game is a Korean psychological drama. The premise is that hundreds of ‚Äúlosers‚Äù who are in hard financial debt compete in various childhood games to be the sole victor of the grand prize - over 4 billion won. The catch is that all who lose are eliminated, both figuratively and literally (in reality, terminated). It is a gripping action drama in which the games require strategy, wits, quick thinking, choosing the right partner or team, and finally, sheer luck to survive.

Squid Game,Which Blackpink member would win the Squid game in your opinion and please rank and give reasons?,"Jisoo for sure would be the first win. Teddy has already explained Jisoo is extremely smart. And she is a good strategist. Since Jisoo plays video games quite often, she probably knows how to think things out quickly and provide the best solution for a good outcome. 2. Rose has the highest IQ in blackpink, but that is in science and ethics. So I wouldn‚Äôt place her first due to the fact that Jisoo still would have an advantage. But never the less Rose would probably make the most reasonable choices through out the game. Giving her a higher chance of winning than most players. 3 . Lisa would be next in line because she is extremely athletic. She might not be the smartest at the games but she for sure she‚Äôd be the most fit. So when it comes to the games that need more physical strength and agility, Lisa would have the upper hand. 4. I would say Jennie would be third with Lisa since she has also proved she is a athletic AND thinks things out. But both categories are evened out and mellowed down when it comes to Jennie, So she would be better than a lot of players due to the balance of each, but out of blackpink she wouldn‚Äôt exactly be the first to win. Another thing Jennie has going is Charm. And she can probably charm others into trusting her and forming an alliance on her side. Giving her a good ground to stand on. Hope these explanations help!!

Squid Game,Who is the most hated character of Squid Game?,"Sang-woo  This is just my opinion- here are the reasons: 1) Sang-woo was at the Squid Game because he lied and  stole billions from his clients .

Squid Game,Behind the Squid Game movie is a real debt crisis shaking South Korea. Is it true?,"Behind the Squid Game movie is a real debt crisis shaking South Korea. Is it true? Korea suffered greatly from a dollar shortage in 1997 A certain country withdrew its capital while propagating that Korea would go bankrupt. International capital investors were also involved here. Koreans suffered a lot from these foreign exchange pranks, and the speculators who participated in these pranks earned more than $2 billion per company in a few years. Korea will never forget this experience So, even when large companies made a lot of profits, they didn't all pay dividends. Large companies kept a lot of dollars in reserve. It is estimated that at least tens of billions of dollars to hundreds of billions of dollars are held by one large Korean conglomerate. So, even in a pandemic situation, you can afford to invest in the US or other countries. And the Korean government has a huge reserve of dollars and is doing currency swaps with other countries. But even more frightening is the amount of dollars each Korean household holds. It is estimated that they hold at least hundreds of billions of dollars and nearly one trillion dollars. When the Korean people received bailout from the IMF during the 1997 financial crisis... Korean came out with all the gold they had in the house and paid off the dollar they borrowed from the IMF. They even provided rings and decorations made of gold to the nation, which should be remembered and cherished for the rest of their lives, such as the couple's wedding rings. Japan has the experience of instigating Korea's foreign exchange crisis in 1997... It is said that they will destroy Korea by withdrawing Japanese funds that have entered the Korean market. In Korea, Japanese capital accounts for only about 1%. Korea's economy has developed and grown very differently than it was back then. Contrary to the claims of the Japanese government, the Japanese financial industry that has entered Korea is paying attention to the fear that Korea will force it to withdraw. If Japanese funds are withdrawn from Korea, as Japan claims, the Japanese capital market will be destroyed. The reason is that.... Now, there are not many industries in Japan that can make money by investing. The wage level of Japanese people has also fallen, and many Japanese companies are in crisis. Natural disasters hit here, and Japan will be in a very serious situation. Now, rather than worrying about Korea, we have to worry about Japan. The fact that the infrastructure that was destroyed by natural disasters in Japan 3 or 4 years ago has not yet been restored... Japan is in a difficult economy due to a huge fiscal deficit, etc., which means that it cannot afford to rebuild. Here again, there was a lot of damage due to natural disasters, which made it more difficult. Even after a disaster 3 or 4 years ago, it has not been restored... Moreover, the Fukushima nuclear accident has not yet recovered. The demolition of nuclear power plants and the removal of radioactivity cost a lot of money. I think it is for this reason that Japan intends to dump radioactively contaminated water into the sea. Pacific countries such as Alaska, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina are thought to be severely affected. Nevertheless, Japan seems to be just dumping radioactively contaminated water into the Pacific Ocean because it is a very difficult economic situation that cannot take into account the damage of other countries. If Japan does not have the money, I think it will have to ask for help from all over the world to deal with radioactively contaminated water. I am curious and do not understand how the country of Japan will cope with the difficult economic situation in the future.",https://www.quora.com/Behind-the-Squid-Game-movie-is-a-real-debt-crisis-shaking-South-Korea-Is-it-true,,,,,

Squid Game,What is ‚ÄòSquid Game‚Äô and why do people love it?,"Because Human's Enjoy violence. The easiest answer is rooted in your primal urges. Nature itself is inherently violent. For the overwhelming majority of the history of Earth's fauna, killing is either a means to sustenance, territory, or protection. Other animals are pure prey, and will only know death in confrontation. The inhabitants of any given ecosystem understand this by instinct. After eons of this violence by design, animals are bound to develop a prey drive; whereby even if they don't  need  to eat or defend against prey, they will revert to their instinct to give chase or attack. It's why your dog goes apeshit when he sees squirrels. They're not natural prey, but he still has the instinct to nab smaller, weaker creatures. Humans are no different. We are arguably the most proficient hunters ever, and unarguably the most versatile. We settle disputes with mutual combat much like a young lion looking to take over the old lion's pride. We fight directly in wars to protect our packs. For tens of thousands of years, we've killed and fought for a variety of reasons. Everything we do in life is either pertinent to our survival or practice for what might be pertinent in the future.

Squid Game,What is the moral of Netflix's Squid Game television show?,"I believe it is something to do with maintaining a sense of humanity, and recognizing the humanity of others, even when the world is set up for people to greedily only seek their own interest.

At the same time, we see other players constantly turning against each other. We come to pity many of them, despite their ruthless actions toward each other. When people lose their sense of humanity, like the Front Man, we see it as a tragedy from his brother's perspective and we are left wanting to see a resolution. Gi-hun entered the games with a selfish mindset, but his humanity grew so much that when he finally won, he was too overcome with the trauma of losing those around him to care about spending the money; and all the money in the world could not bring back his mother. When Il-nam called him and revealed his true identity, Gi-hun was again confronted with how unjust the world was, but he was forced to make a decision about whether or not to believe that humans can still be good to each other. Il-nam bet that nobody would help the drunk outside from freezing to death, but Gi-hun bet the opposite. And at the last minute he was right. He was right to believe in human selflessness despite the bleak unfairness of the world and from this he gained the motivation to start using his money and knowledge of the games to help others.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-moral-of-Netflixs-Squid-Game-television-show,It is a great happiness as a South Korean to see people decipher the meaning of the drama correctly like you.,,,,

What should I do?","With the intake of so very few calories, your body has probably entered starvation mode. In that mode, it does all it can to conserve those calories as fat by slowing your metabolism. That works against your efforts to lose the fat. Try sticking with the healthy foods, but add more protein to your diet to where you are consuming more like about 1,200 to 1,400 calories per day in total. That will still keep your body in a calorie deficit, but will enable your metabolism to fire back up to burn your fat. Also, since you are working out, it is possible that your body composition is changing, by adding more muscle as fat cells wane. Muscle weighs more than fat, so the scale will not register the weight loss. But you WANT muscle. Get yourself a body fat percentage checker, and monitor that metric as well as body weight.

Crypto Currency,What are the hottest Bitcoin startups (e.g. crypto-currency startups such as Ripple also count)?,"Santi Subotovsky from Emergence Capital wrote a great piece highlighting the Bitcoin ecosystem:  Bitcoin Landscape: The Who's Who in the Bitcoin Ecosystem Second Market also lays out the ecosystem nicely here:  Bitcoin Ecosystem - SecondMarket I assume you would just like a list in order to go and research, but I would much rather do that at the end and explain where the large opportunities in Bitcoin fall. At Boost VC we picked Bitcoin as our sector focus, and when we chose to do so there was no sector of ""Bitcoin Startups"", there weren't enough companies in the space for there to be a sector, today that has changed with the media attention, and just the general recognition of how great the currency revolution can become. I'm just saying this so that you understand that I have dabbled with Bitcoin for a while. I am also an early investor in Coinbase, and will immediately say that it was a great decision on my part to invest in Brian Armstrong. At the foundation of Bitcoin, there is an enormous opportunity to unite the world with a global currency system. However, at this point and time most people are using Bitcoin as an investment vehicle, much like gold or a commodity, rather than the currency or even the currency protocol that it can be used for. When I was speaking with Venture firms over the last 12 months about Bitcoin, most VCs were playing with the question of whether to invest in the currency or companies, and nearly all of them chose currency, which at this time was a good call financially (BTC broke $400/BTC today), but we need a healthy number of startups to help grow the ecosystem in order to make the asset worth something.  In my research and conversations I have found a few things:
1. $USD are better for buying coffee at a coffee shop than Bitcoin
2. No one understands what is going on in the regulatory environment, but everyone has an opinion about it
3. It is one of the most passionate communities I have ever been involved with
4. There is unlimited potential for Bitcoin, it is internet big.
5. Bitcoin startups are not only overcoming the fact that they are a startup, they have to overcome the fact that banks do not wish to bank Bitcoin companies, and that there is a regulatory grey area for them to work in.
This research also lead me to the most immediate huge opportunities in the BTC space:
1. Remittance payments : This only makes sense with a global currency, it's also a 500B a year market. Western Union is f---ed, if you catch my drift.
2. Micro-transactions : Nearly no transaction fee means you can pay 5 cents for an article. If publishers and media adopt Bitcoin as a payment method, it would help get widespread adoption of BTC.
3. Inflationary economies : Argentina, Cyprus, Venezuela... all great opportunities to find uses for Bitcoin.
4. Making Bitcoin easier to use, still not simple enough for most people. Exchanges are obviously a large opportunity as well. Now that I have identified the spaces, I will list some startups in the Bitcoin space that are going after large opportunities, I will try not to be biased with only Boost companies, but its always hard not to be. These are in no particular order, and to Bitcoin companies who might read this, I apologize if I missed yours and you are creating a large opportunity. - BitPagos

Let me start with what I think we need, then explain why it is possible to create a system that‚Äôs ‚Äúonly solar‚Äù as the primary energy source. We want solar and wind, because some places have poor solar and good wind resources. But solar and or wind can provide energy only about 30‚Äì80% of the time depending on location no matter how much you install. So both solar and wind need something to fill in the gaps. Solar or wind plus batteries is now cheaper than fossils in most places. But that‚Äôs for a battery sized for about 4 hours of about 25% of the total demand. This is still helpful for a variety of reasons and they are profitable right now.  South Australia's Tesla battery on track to make back a third of cost in a year So why not just install enough batteries? One day of storage from batteries and pumped hydro is the point of diminishing returns and allows some 99% of the electricity to be supplied with solar or wind. It becomes very expensive and technically challenging to store weeks of total demand. Even one day roughly doubles the cost of solar alone even projecting 100$/KWH batteries costs. If we electrify everything that makes sense like ground vehicles, short range water and air transport, and industrial processes, we have a pretty good system. It covers about 90% of our total energy demand. That‚Äôs not enough. We still need longer term grid electricity reserve generators and they are fueled with hydrocarbons from fossils. We also will need hydrocarbons for long distance sea and air transport and chemicals. Recycling our wastes for hydrocarbons and other rare materials is the ideal solution.  It prevents dump pollution and methane emissions which are significant. It prevents plastic from escaping dumps and creating the global micro plastic pollution which is harmful to life. It recovers all the strategic materials we are in danger of running short of. The mining for new materials is expensive and environmentally damaging. We must recycle anyway so why not use the hydrocarbons? There is more than enough waste to provide all the remaining hydrocarbon demand. That is a complete global renewable, recyclable and sustainable system. Brian Donovan's answer to Can solar power become a major power source in the coming 20 years? If so, why? If not, what are your ideas? Brian Donovan's answer to If fossil fuels were banned, would crude oil still be refined for it's other products, and what would happen to the distillates that would have otherwise been refined into fuel? Note the waste recycling I am suggesting is done in a closed system. Waste comes in, and product come out. Nothing is burned, it‚Äôs run electrically, it can use excess solar and wind, and there are no emissions. Some of the wastes should be recycled using biochar which leaves charcoal that doubles the productivity of poor soils while sequestering massive amounts of carbon for 100‚Äì1000‚Äôs of years. In theory we can use ‚Äúonly solar‚Äù as the energy source. It takes a little careful defining of terms. Using solar power to recycle wastes into fuels could be considered solar. In a steady state renewable system, the waste all comes from plants which are powered with solar. No fossils involved. Just solar. *Wind and hydro reduce costs substantially in some situations. I always like to have a backup system available for the unknown. *Solar and wind are the cheapest available energy source in 75% of the world. That‚Äôs before government subsidies. Don't believe the fossil promoters. Fossils kill millions of people per year. Save millions of lives and trillions of dollars per year by going renewable ASAP. Renewable Energy Is Now The Cheapest Option - Even Without Subsidies ",https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-we-only-using-solar-power,"Full disclosure matters.

Solar Energy,How can I start a business in solar energy in india?,"People above has already answered the theoretical part, so I would like to give a practical answer to this question.
I am trying my luck into this business since last 5-6 months and if one asks me how to get in, my answer would be-""If you are starting up and do not have any sound backup(financial,political) DO NOT follow the procedure as they tell you in workshops. Just go,have a deal with some established company and work as a freelancer.""
This is because finding a real customer for solar plants is very tough. Competition is increasing every day with both new and old players entering the market to have their share of the cake.   is becoming very tough for the small companies to compete with the bigger ones. Moreover, there's no support from government side either, no matter how much they claim of Startup India. So, to conclude:
In order to enter this business, initially you don't need to incorporate any firm, you don't need to invest any big money, you don't need to get any licenses and all...Nothing. What you need is customers. If you have customer, rest of things will get done automatically.  Start freelancing, get hold on the subject as well on market and afterwards gradually roll down your own company. It is apparently   the best way to enter into any business. Good Luck.

Plantbased,My children are vegan and my mom watches my children while I‚Äôm at work. She keeps feeding them animal products. How do I tell her to stop?,"That is very strange. I think that you should have a serious discussion with her about this situation. She should respect your values and decisions and therefore not force meat or dairy products down your children‚Äôs throats. If she however does not respect this and continues this behavior, you should not let her watch the kids. I see that some of the comments are saying that someone who is a vegan and wants their children to eat fully plantbased is wrong. The argument for this is that a plantbased diet is unhealthy and not suitable for young children. However, The American Academy of Nutrition says that plantbased diets are appropriate for all stages of the life cycle. If you look at it from another perspective; a meat eater also  forces  their child to eat animal products. I find it highly unlikely that a meat eater would show their child a video of how animals are slaughtered or explain to their child how the dairy industry works. So it comes down to this; A vegan feeds their child a plant based diet and it is proven to be suitable for all stages of life. It is not illegal. If a child eats a healthy and overlooked plant based diet, there is no issue. However, I believe it is wrong for this mother to feed the children animal products. It is not her choice to do so. Think about it this way; If the grandmother was rambling on and on about how meat is disgusting and how the children are not allowed to eat it, it would also be wrong and not her choice to make that decision. The decision lies in the guardian‚Äôs hands, and as long as the children are healthy (which they can be by eating plant based) - everything should be fine.",https://www.quora.com/My-children-are-vegan-and-my-mom-watches-my-children-while-I-m-at-work-She-keeps-feeding-them-animal-products-How-do-I-tell-her-to-stop,"That's not the argument at all. The argument is that if the children have no problem eating food with animal products in it, then they aren't vegan - and there is nothing wrong with giving non-vegan food to a non-vegan.","A meateater gives their children the whole menu of things and as they grow up they can start saying no to some of them. A vegan gives their kids a restricted menu and tells them that that is all they get and they have to ‚Äúobey‚Äù. There is no decision here. If i try to convince my young kids at every turn that meat is bad then i can. Everyone can. But you take away the childrens choice. You go against their freedom so that you can impose your beliefs. It is the same with religion. Children are forced to go to church from an early age and when they're old enough the parent says that they can choose‚Ä¶ can they? They've been already indoctrinated and in most cases they wont choose but they will accept. The optimal thing would be: let them live religion free until old enough and then explain catholicism, atheism, islamism, budhism etc to them and let them choose. That is a choice. Give them alternatives and let them choose.",She is not forcing them down their throats,"I completely agree with you Viv. I cannot understand why people feel it is correct to feed their children meat and let them make a decision with regards to their diet later on .
Giving an innocent child meat without explaining where it has come from,and in most cases taking them to farms ,showing them cute farm animals in books and singing nursery rhymes like ‚ÄòOld MacDonalds had a farm ‚Äò is ,to me,wrong . They do not make the association between these animals and the corpse on their plate and when they do ,may be repulsed at what they are being asked or made to eat . Please ..particularly if you are vegetarian / vegan ..give them respect for animals from when they are babies so that they understand the association and why your choice is to give them a vegetarian/ vegan diet .",
Plantbased,What is the most common disease vegans have?,"I was a vegetarian for a few years and vegan for 6 months or so.

Plantbased,What is your story behind eating healthy and living clean? What are some of your best weightloss transformation photos as a result of this change? How are you maintaining the weight today?,"I reached my maximum weight of 96.5 kg in 2019 (around 212 pounds). I had a wake up call. At 163 cm, this was almost double my healthy weight and a bmi of 37, I was fast approaching morbid obesity. Here are some pictures of me at that weight.    In November last year, I started eating a wholefood plantbased diet (no oil, refined sugar, flour, highly processed food, meat, eggs or dairy). I have not been exercising, only changed my diet, and have lost 17kg (around 38 pounds). Here I am today.      I still have about 15kg to lose before I am at my ideal weight. But at 79.5kg, I am much healthier than at 96.5kg. My bmi is now in the overweight class and I feel so much better. I sleep better and have way more energy. Life is so much more exciting now and I cant wait to be even healthier! For those wondering what i eat, EDIT: I must say that my diet is varied and not limited at all! In replacement of milk, i drink coconut milk, rice milk, soy milk, almond milk. I eat alot of homemade curries and stirfrys (i water fry the food which just takes some getting used to) I eat smoothies and nice cream (ice cream made from ripe frozen bananas). I also enjoy making creamy smoothies by adding cashew nuts and a bit of cinnamon for that naughty yet healthy taste. I use starchy veggies like corn and potatoes. Non starchy veg like carrots, spinach, kale, mushrooms, brinjal/eggplant, lettuce, and many others. I also eat whole grains (like brown rice and quinoa) as well as legumes (beans, lentils, chickpeas, edamame beans). No bread, no pasta, no flour Fruit ranging from sweet (like dates and oranges) to savoury (such as tomato and cucumber). Some fruits are amazingly low in calories yet provide many benefits, such as berries In the mornings i like to eat a big, high fat salad. I add avocado and seeds such as sunflower seeds to the salad , but no oil. Be creative with your salad! Try adding some new things like ponegranante seeds and grapes! I like to put grilled onion for example. I prefer eating a high fat meal for breakfast because high carbs first thing in the morning may make you feel hungry.

Crypto Currency,Is crypto-currency going into a bubble?,"There seems to be a common misconception in some of the responses to your question. It is that you can ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in a currency, like bitcoin or USD. To invest in something is to purchase ownership of it in order to receive future cash flows from it. When you invest wisely, both parties win‚Äîyou, and the person who sells you the asset. You win, because you have given up current consumption in favor of a greater amount of future consumption, which you prefer. The person who sells that investment also wins, because he or she gives up future consumption in favor of current consumption which he or she prefers. Can you invest in a stock or a stock index fund? Yes, of course. You become the owner of productive enterprises, and you receive a portion of their profits, either directly as dividends, or, if the earnings are retained, in the increase in value from their increased capital. Can you invest in bonds? Yes, of course. A bond promises a future stream of cash flows. But you can‚Äôt invest in a foreign currency. Money doesn‚Äôt produce any future cash flow. In fact, money doesn‚Äôt produce anything at all. When you trade one currency for another, in the hopes that the future exchange rate will change in your favor, you are NOT investing. You are simply gambling. Unlike investing, gambling is NOT a win-win. If you buy a stock and it produces a cash flow for you (dividends plus capital gains on sale) then both you and the seller of the stock have won. When you gamble, the only way you can win X is if someone else loses X. If you like gambling, but prefer gambling on currency exchanges to lotteries or casinos, then do it. But don‚Äôt kid yourself that you are ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù. More importantly, don‚Äôt use Quora to spread the dangerous falsehood that currency speculation is investing.",https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-currency-going-into-a-bubble,"Investing in Bitcoin is similar to investing in a stock, here‚Äôs why. If you think that a larger share of future global transactions will be done in Bitcoin, and less by traditional currencies, by buying bitcoin you are investing in the future buying power of Bitcoin. A stock is the same way. An investor believes that one share, valued at $5 today, will represent the same size of a more valuable company in the future. Thus, both scenarios are betting on owning a share of an entity that increases in value.","I used to think it the same way, but now I tend to think that currency is a proxy against a nation‚Äôs productivity, so I think it is still investing, admittedly it does not give any form of direct dividend, but the fact that the currency have stronger demand sometime later, and thus increase in value is your reward","Hi, dear users of steemit!

Crypto Currency,Do other crypto-currencies have a chance or is Bitcoin too far ahead?,"The value of a fiat currency, be it in paper or in blockchain, is defined by: Primary - people desire to to accept it as payment, and Secondary - people desire to invest into it. Needless to say, ‚Äú2‚Äù is impossible without ‚Äú1‚Äù. For US$, as well as all other paper money, it is easy - you need to have US$ to buy anything in US, Government makes sure of that. That creates primary demand, and that combined with Government guarantees makes it appealing for saving. However as the examples of other countries show, when the citizens shun local currency, it is rubbished. Bitcoins are required on the dark web market, by some ransomware, and if you wish to donate to Wikileaks. That created massive primary appreciation, which triggered investments (secondary appreciation). Before that Bitcoin was just a novelty. When some pizza shop decided to sell pizzas for bitcoins, it was a sensation. The bitcoins you had to pay for pepperoni and cheese would possibly buy you a Porsche these days. However then some people realised that Bitcoins could take the operations that prior to that were cash-only, to the Internet. That created a true demand. I dare to predict (mind you, I was wrong on Bitcoin before) that to succeed, an alternative cryptocurency has to offer some superior features to a particular market segment. Would it be superior theft protection, superior confidentiality, built-in escrow for all payments, superior avoidance of US sanctions - but someone, be it a web stripper in Kyiv, an executive in NY leaking info before it is published by NYSE, a spy in Tehran, a drug dealer in Chicago, a black market speculator in Donetsk, a software developer in Crimea or an Internet musician in Cairo, should decide that they want to accept those coins because it is safer than Bitcoin (let alone their local bank). Without that, nothing makes sense. Yes, anyone (well, not anyone, any group of talented programmers) can fork Bitcoin or Ethereum code, but without people willing to trade in your coin, it is worthless. Mind you, the moment a cryptocurrency takes significant share of domestic transactions, the  Government   will step in .

Aside from that, another program that is starting to grow is generating 3D proposals for clients who would like to know how solar panels will look on their property, and which ‚Äòposition and angle‚Äô would be best for the solar system to absorb the most energy. I would highly suggest selling our partnering with a solar company to enhance their services. Financing & Leasing for Solar Systems (Recommended):  A lot of customers are unable to afford solar systems even with government subsidies, and it can be difficult for solar companies to help reduce the price of their products to make it more affordable for them. By creating a finance or leasing company in the solar energy sector, you can directly solve this problem by creating a program that makes paying of the solar system more affordable, and without placing a lien on the property. The good part about this niche is that fact that as solar becomes more widely accepted, so will your services. Sales & Marketing Agency:  By creating a sales & marketing agency you are a third party brand from a parent company, in which you are paid a commission based on every account you acquire. This allows you to promote, sell, advertise, and market your company without much liability. The only issue with this is sometimes you might be paid unfairly compared to how much the account is actually worth, which is something you will need to decide for yourself. Solar Installation Team:  By creating an agency of professional solar installers you can outsource your team to different solar providers who will contract you to complete specific projects. With the growing demand of solar projects to be completed this might be a good opportunity. Solar Manufacturing (Not recommended):  This is not recommended for anyone unless you have start-up capital and are willing to provide something so innovative that it could revolutionize the industry. If you are still persistent in moving forward as a supplier I would start-off by funding a research team that is willing to work with you on your new idea that already has connections to a supplier rather than competing against them. Simply get yourself a patent that you can license and that the supplier can mass produce for you so you can sell it to other solar companies looking to enhance their products. Solar Storage Company:  A lot of solar panels are coming from countries like China, which is currently the leader in the industry. By storing large solar systems at wholesale cost, you can resell them to other solar companies who might not have the necessary space or capital especially with the added tariffs during import. Battery System Supplier:  All solar systems during the night or at large scale require a battery backup system. If you can propose a battery backup system that will work well in the industry (or in your country) that is manufactured by organic material rather than fossil fuels. This would solve a huge problem in the industry as we are trying to move away from fossil fuels not promote it! In summary:  If you would like to start your own solar company, make sure you find your niche, and that you have created and idea that is innovative to differentiate from others. I wouldn‚Äôt advise going in it alone but building a team that has knowledge or experience in the industry already. Also be aware of any government programs that are being offered, for example look into ‚ÄúFIT or Net-Metering‚Äù in your country/area. This will greatly influence your solar business.

Solar Energy,Is solar energy sustainable?,"This point is a little aside from the main question, but it interesting (to me at least). A colleague of mine at the University of New South Wales made an interesting point about the sustainability of the growth of the PV industry based on a simple argument.* His argument was much more detailed than what I present here, but here's the jist. The energy payback time (EPBT) of of a PV module is the time required to produce enough energy to 'pay back' its embedded energy -- that is, the net sum of energy required to manufacture it, including things like aluminium for the frames, glass for the front, etc. It's typically around 2-10 years, depending on the PV module technology. The lifetime (EL) is the effective lifetime of the PV module in the field (de-rating for gradual degradation, if you like), which is typically 5-30 years, depending on the PV module technology. The sustainable growth rate of installed PV generation capacity is the rate at which we could produce new PV modules using only energy produced by existing PV modules and without requiring any new energy from non-PV sources.  So, for example, if EPBT is 4 years and EL is 20 years, then one PV module could produce 4 additional modules over it's lifetime. That's a compound annual growth rate of 7.18%, which would be the sustainable growth rate of PV electricity. Of course, the rate depends a great deal on the PV module technology, with (a) energy production (aka efficiency), (b) cost (aka energy) and (c) effective lifetime being key drivers in the equation. Incidentally, these are the same drivers in the economics of PV electricity! In some years, the installed capacity of PV electricity grows a high rate that is probably not sustainable. Thus, the need for better, cheaper, faster, more durable PV technologies. Support your local PV research lab!! *Martin Green, can't remember when/where he said it or I'd give him a proper citation.",https://www.quora.com/Is-solar-energy-sustainable,"‚Äú‚Ä¶if EPBT is 4 years and EL is 20 years, then one PV module could produce‚Ä¶‚Äù ??? 5 additional modules, right?",,,,
Solar Energy,Which country harnesses the maximum solar energy?,"Germany. Record 50% electricity of Germany Produced using Solar Renewable Energy
Germany produced a record 50 percent of its electricity needs through solar panel at the start of June, breaking a huge milestone on its march to renewable energy. The success of Germany‚Äôs solar production lies with encouraging people to install them on their roof tops Analysis from the Fraunhofer ISE research institute showed solar panels in Germany generated a record 24.24 GW of electricity between 1pm and 2pm on Friday, June 6th. And on Monday June 9th,2014  which was a national holiday, solar power production peaked at 23.1 GW, which equalled 50.6 percent of total electricity demand - setting another milestone. With this success Germany will need more storage capacities to store the solar energy  Germany is on its way clearly showing that when a country has a will it can say Bye Bye to Nuclear Energy  Why Indian Government is not interested in Solar Energy? The answer is very simple what your heart says is right  Nothing happens and nothing is done in India unless it comes with a Bag  Indian government can also bring a law which can make it a mandatory for every building and bungalow to install a solar Panels on its roofs",https://www.quora.com/Which-country-harnesses-the-maximum-solar-energy,"Just to give you the other side of the 'successful' German model, you may want to read the first answer in this post:  Should other nations follow Germany's lead on promoting solar power?  India surely will need more solar, but the costs still need to reach at parity for a general consumer to install it on their roof. Govt has successfully implemented the solar policy for large plants, which is now trickling down to smaller plants and eventually roof tops.",What was the Indian reference for?,China has more installed capacity of solar power as Germany I assume.,,
Crypto Currency,What's Elon Musk's take on Bitcoin? What is his take on crypto currencies in general?,"Elon Musk does not own any bitcoin, but he has taken it somewhat positively with caveats, that it needs more work to be done. Before I dive into more details, I would like to inspire readers to get some more essentials out of the way. As of today, bitcoin is certainly not looking unsuccessful. I would refer the readers to the history of bitcoin on Wikipedia. The landmark essentials are that in November 2008, a paper was posted on the internet under the name Satoshi Nakamoto titled  bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System . This paper detailed methods of using a  peer-to-peer  network to generate what was described as ""a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust"". In January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with the release of the first  open source  bitcoin client and the issuance of the first bitcoins, with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the first block of bitcoins ever (known as the ""genesis block""), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. The value of the first bitcoin transactions were negotiated by individuals on the  bitcointalk  forums with one notable transaction of 10,000 BTC used to indirectly purchase two pizzas delivered by  Papa John‚Äôs . On 6 August 2010, a major  vulnerability  in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "" blockchain "" which let users bypass bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins. On 15 August, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in bitcoin's history.
Since then, the trust came on line for bitcoin, but it has picked up ever since.
To put it in perspective, if you converted all your net worth into bitcoins exactly one year back, today your net worth would be twice as much.  Here is where you can read more about bitcoin. History of bitcoin - Wikipedia From this chart, bitcoin seems to be on the success pathway.  Now to the question:  Published on Feb 26, 2015 In this interview, Elon discusses his thoughts on bitcoin. Will bitcoin be more than a means of illegal transactions? Elon doesn't think so. This is not a bad thing. He does acknowledge that digital currency does need to be revolutionized, however. Here is why: For any currency, the guarantee of the securer is on the line. Think for example about United States Dollars.
As of today, anyone who carries United States Dollars can convert them into British Pound. Would ten years from now the value for both be the same?
May be not! See for example in this chart ~ that USD has gotten stronger over years.  The second thing is security. Any time something is tied up with something illegal, and there is risk of stealing by hackers, people usually want to play a conservative approach. Here is more on bitcoins for knowledge.

Crypto Currency,"Onecoin will be the biggest crypto currency in 2018, is it true?","1. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many OneCoins will be mined or transfer to OneCoin. On open market will come only Coins which are in hands of people who got OC through education packages. You are stupid if you think that 120 BLS will be pushed on open market. So stupid is nobody in company. 2. About SQL serves this is something you read on many places where your brother haters wrote and I understand you that in deficiency of better facts you can write again and again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 3. I am surprised that you said as BitCoin is decentralized cryptocurrency. This is such big shit because BitCoin is centralized 100 times stronger then OneCoin. But this centralization is like ‚Äúdeep state‚Äù in USA. Group of reach people manipulate with value every day and 99% BitCoin owners are here only to place their money which in one moment this group will take like meat on plate. This manipulation is so obvious that only blind people like you can‚Äôt see it, probably reason is that you earned some money which you never ever dream about this and now you are ready defend BitCoin with your life if it‚Äôs necessary. One day when you wake up and open computer I‚Äôm worry you will see computer screen and be in panic because somebody decide that BitCoin should drop down that millions people sell in panic their dream and of course we know who will buy it. This is thing which follow you every day before you go in bed. THIS IS REAL PONZI when millions people lost money for some on the top. 4. When you say that for OC we can‚Äôt buy nothing, you should go on DEALSHAKER and see what we can buy there. This is our internal market but people there trust in this and develop it with hart. What you can buy for BitCoin. Almost nothing. Before 600 big sales networks accept BitCoin and now only 3 or 4. Did you ask yourself why. Easy. To much speculative currency and risk for them. 5. Old story is that in 2009 BitCoin was only USD0.10. Now after only 2 years ( Forget 6 years because almost 6 years nothing happened ), when group of people decided BitCoin grown on USD4.300.00. Do you have calculator. This is rising 43.000 times for 2 years and YOU STILL THINK THAT IS NORMAL MARKET RULE. So poor and stupid. OneCoin rise from EUR0.50 to EUR12.45. This is 25 times. So OneCoin should rise more around 1.800 TIMES to match your NORMAL STOCK INCREASING. 6. Easy calculation for normal people or everybody who wants understand. All of us know that 99% people has between 0.001 to maybe 10 BitCoins. Around 900 owners has 99% of BitCoins. So, if anybody normal can think that 1% of total BitCoins, let‚Äôs say around 200.000 BitCoins can make turnover on stock over 2 billions USD every day. EVERY DAY. All of these small people just changed their money into the BitCoin in hope that they will earn some money, not to play stock games. So, who make every day 2 billions turnover. Answer is easy, who has 99% of BitCoin value. Question: Who can decide when BitCoin will go up or down. Answer is easy: Who has 99% of BitCoin value. So, question is: IS BITCOIN DECENTRLALIZED CRYPTOCURRENCY. Answer is easy: BitCoin is CENTRALIZED and MANIPULATIVE cryptocurrency, strongest then OneCooin. Why is this? Because OneCoin will never grow for 4.000 times for 2 years and inside growing got several falls just enough that small people lost money and reach people take their money and SHOW MUST GO ON.

Crypto Currency,What happens to Bitcoin/Crypto currencies if we go through a global recession in 2018?,"I‚Äôve been obsessed with this question in a way. Perhaps the best way I can answer it is, is to share some of the joint results from all the people I have asked. Bitcoin was  not  present during the last global recession. It was one of the reasons (I guess)  Satoshi Nakamoto  made it. Any model or argument we apply of money moving to gold, silver, bonds, etc. is invalidated, as the mathematical equation does not address the ‚Äúcrypto-currency‚Äù variable. It is almost like talking about physics equations and then discovering  c  (the speed of light) how that changes everything. In the same manner, I believe, Bitcoin/Crypto-currencies too will change everything. Common logic may suggest, people will withdraw their money and keep it under their mattresses. Well, that didn‚Äôt happen last time. In a global recession, unemployment goes high, people go out of work, manufacturing slows down, inflation goes high, and a host of other problems. Investment institution led logic will dictate,  move your money from bank and stocks into precious metals and XYZ . Well, not everyone is poised to just simply go and buy gold and move money without any ownership of it. Then there is crypto-currencies. Where you  seemingly  are in control of your money. Not the Dollar, nor the Rupee or the Shilling. But a crypto-currency that otherwise has no value, but people all around you - are instilling one in it. Something like the cowry shells and the yap stones. No intrinsic value, but an imaginary number tied to the fiat (or who knows, maybe with Gold). I feel, there will be a lot of flight of capital from the  fiat  world and  precious metals  world to the  crypto-world . The world is more at ease with a libertarian type system not in control with the bank or the government. Despite the government‚Äôs will and reach, parallel monetary systems has developed. Note the plurality:  systems . Bitcoin/Crypto-currencies will account for a significant increase in circulation and price increase because of the demand. It might  not  be used a currency per se, but more like a commodity for  safe-keeping one‚Äôs fiat . Bonus: Which then begs to ask the question, what happens when we come out of the recession and we want to move our money  away  from crypto into the fiat world?",https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-Bitcoin-Crypto-currencies-if-we-go-through-a-global-recession-in-2018,,,,,
Crypto Currency,Is it worth buying crypto currencies in 2018?,"It depends on these factors: Do you have money to waste? What I mean by ‚Äòwaste‚Äô is that, will you have still enough money left for your personal needs if a particular cryptocurrency you invested crashes down to 0 dollars? Are you patient enough to wait weeks, months or even years till your chosen cryptocurrency rises in price? Will you stay calm if the cryptocurrency you invested in starts falling in price very quickly and you start ‚Äòpanic-selling‚Äô ? Have you researched that particular cryptocurrency before investing in it? If you are sure that you pass all these factors, then you can start researching in what cryptocurrency you want to invest. When researching, look for a cryptocurrency that has a solid team, a solid roadmap, check price charts if it is just a pump & dump cryptocurrency, look if the community supports its cryptocurrency and has little doughts about it. Do NOT follow the hype train and do NOT believe in FUD, always make solid decision based on your research and not out of pure luck or stress. My recommendations are: DigiByte - a solid cryptocurrency with a solid team, is over 4 years old now, the community is very enthusiastic about it and welcomes new people, provides infrastructure (funds, servers) for developers if they are looking to develop an application based on DigiByte‚Äôs blockchain. Features 5 mining algorithms for pure decentralization and for protection against ASICs or a 51% attack. Transactions are blazingly fast, with an average transaction taking 15 seconds and costing less than half a cent, can be mined on ASICs and GPUs using different algorithms. Bitcoin - the original cryptocurrency, the price is down at the moment, Bitcoin is a long-term investment, has the highest chance of mainstream adoption is the most popular among the cryptocurrency enthusiasts and among the public, requires ASICs to be mined. Ethereum - a feature-rich cryptocurrency, features smart-contracts, backed by big companies, has abilities to create ICOs, popular among developers, requires beefy GPUs to mine it.
I also recommend to look into EOS. Monero - a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, has a lot of uses on the dark net, but a lot more casual people, who want to hide their identity also use it, one of the most secure cryptocurrencies, solid development, can be mined on an average PC. These are just my recommendations, remember to do your own research before actually investing and invest as much as you are comfortable with!",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-buying-crypto-currencies-in-2018,,,,,
Crypto Currency,Is there a cryptocurrency you could predict having a 100x increase in the next 2 years?,"There are some very good arguments for and against why one should or should not be predicting the next big coin. You might just want to stick with btc, instead of go all out in the speculative coin world? This is a risky game, and you only have to spend 30 seconds looking at a bitcoin chart to see the wild swings that have occurred in the last few years. This is a game not for the weak of heart and fortunes have been lost or made very quickly. You need to understand the risks before you get in this game, and I would recommend you do over 100 hours research before diving in the deep end. I can tell you that this is still the wild wild west in terms of bitcoin and crypto and its an asset that is only about 10 years old. So in technical terms bitcoin is still just a very young baby! In fact, its hard even been born. Should You Invest In Bitcoin? This is a simple question with a simple answer. Do you have disposable income? This would mean that you literally have throw away money, or money you can lose and still have not psychological attachment to. If you are struggling to pay your rent and your grocery bills each week, I would not recommend you get started in crypto until your financial conditions change. Too many times I have seen people using their rent money or grocery bill money to invest in Crypto and they become unstuck or get into serious financial strife especially if the crypto markets suddenly take a dive! You can lose up to 90% of your initial investment. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, so I do not expect the wild swings in price to simply just go away! I can assure you of that but when BAKKT goes online later in the year, many institutes will start talking, and I feel in the future bitcoin could be a part of every institutional investors' portfolio. This is just a guess, but there is lots of talk about this in 2019. Also There is now rumor that Millennials now consider bitcoin to be like a new form of ‚Äúdigital gold‚Äù. As physical gold has recently won hearts and seen a dramatic rise in the price! Recession fears have caused millennials to also consider adding digital gold or {BITCOIN} to their portfolios. Survey: 40% of Millennials Look to Crypto in the Event of Recession  CLICK HERE TO READ THE ARTICLE! REMEMBER :  Bitcoin‚Äôs network has about 100,000 nodes. SWIFT‚Äôs network has about 11,000 nodes (banks). Bitcoin‚Äôs network is almost 10x larger than SWIFT.

Crypto Currency,How can I earn passive income from crypto currency?,"It really depends on what you mean by passive income. If you are referring to receiving a recurring yield, have a look into Proof of Stake crypto, like Binance Coin (BNB)*, Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), among others. Proof of Stake crypto involves an upfront investment of that currency or token, and then you receive rewards on a regular basis. This is almost a truly passive way to invest your capital and earn passive income. Or are you thinking more along the lines of Day Trading? I am personally quite partial towards day trading, but I will tell you now, it is anything but passive. Daily research, understanding technical analysis and charting, having a vested interest in finance, experience in data analytics and mathematics, these things have given me a record of achieving about 550% returns average per quarter, but it‚Äôs highly risky and nerve wracking as hell, and I definitely don‚Äôt recommend it as a lifestyle. As I said above, if you are interested in passive income then look into anything that offers dividend yields, proof of stake yields, look into being a liquidity provider. These are much safer, and essentially guaranteed passive income after you do the leg work of research. *BNB is a hybrid of Proof of Authority (PoA) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).",https://cryptocurrency.quora.com/How-to-earn-passive-income-from-crypto-currency,,,,,

In third world countries however, a lot of people will have to do with what there is.

Fake News,What action should media outlets take to combat fake news?,"From Quoran feedback: This answer has been modified to take a unique Quoran perspective, in that it now also presents the pro-fake news position. Fake News is published for a specific purpose‚Ä¶ primarily to form public opinion‚Ä¶ therefore there is reason behind it.
‚Ä¶ and if we don‚Äôt look at the reasoning, we can‚Äôt truly understand, or make a judgement on which side of the fence that we are on‚Ä¶ and that may be any side depending upon your inherent viewpoint. IE. you might be pro Fake News when it emphasises your views
‚Ä¶ and against, when it doesn‚Äôt. So gird your loins, as this is not going to be an easy ride‚Ä¶ we are going to enter a very dark area‚Ä¶ original answer first‚Ä¶  Just read Jimmy‚Äôs answer‚Ä¶ it started well‚Ä¶ offered promise‚Ä¶ then fell flat.
Sorry Jimmy, but it just drifted away, focusing on common or garden tat. Let‚Äôs instead focus on the primary force behind Fake News.
 The need to modify public opinion (forget click bait, and bad journalism et al). Fake News has obviously been with us since the first city states formed, thousands of years ago. Typically and traditionally, this is a state, or political ‚Äòtool‚Äô Any educated person expects a substantial amount of fake news to be issued from any government, in whichever country.
It goes with the job. (We‚Äôll examine a good example below) As an aside
 What is worrying is how, at election time, Fake News is brazenly used. Brexit legitimised this, and Trump piled in‚Ä¶ say anything‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fine :(
 We can usually see through it, but it is worrying.
 Anyway‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs get back to the traditional Fake News‚Ä¶ the serious stuff! Traditional Fake News - Tested against the laws of physics With the mass availability of web access, and video cameras
‚Ä¶ traditional fake news can often be  easily discredited . In most cases, you only need an inquiring mind, and an education in what is ‚Äòphysically possible‚Äô What is interesting is that the engineers exposing Fake News‚Ä¶ themselves get discredited.  (check comments for Andrew Brown‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a beauty) Have you noticed the rise in the use of the term ‚Äòconspiracy theorists‚Äô? Always first associated with a crazy claim, and then pointed at an engineer who has stated  ‚ÄúHey guys‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a Nobel Prize on offer here if this claim is true‚Äù  :) Let‚Äôs take for Example one of the ‚Äòbest and most important‚Äô Fake News stories.
‚Ä¶ and let‚Äôs look at it from an angle of common or garden physics. IE. Everybody with a basic education can understand, and arrive at a 100% conclusion (no doubts). A Simple Airplane Crash (with full fuel load) Newtons 1st law tells us that when the aircraft makes impact‚Ä¶ when the fuel tanks burst open‚Ä¶ the fuel is released at the speed of the aircraft at impact. The fuel smashes into the ground or buildings and vapourises to engulf whatever area it can engulf. It ignites and forms an enormous fireball that burns and scorches everything within it. The explosive force rips apart the aircraft components, and blasts thousands of pieces of aluminium and steel across a wide area.
Some of those pieces will be launched skywards, and they will fall back to earth. An enormous ‚Äòdebris field is created. Within the area of the fireball‚Ä¶ blackness. All this is governed by the laws of physics‚Ä¶ we might not like it, but that‚Äôs how it is. Every time a plane with full fuel load, crashes at speed, into a solid object‚Ä¶ this is what happens. Here is what it looks like:  You can see the size of the fireball‚Ä¶ and this is just a small section of the debris field. Some big bits sort of survive‚Ä¶. most of the body is split into thousands of pieces that are scattered everywhere. Let‚Äôs apply this knowledge to a famous Fake News story ALL the News reports stated:
A fully fueled Boeing 757 crashed into a building ‚Äòhead on‚Äô. That is at least 35,000 litres of jet fuel (full load 42,000 litres) It had somehow made it to a ‚Äòhigh speed landing scenario‚Äô and hit the side of the building. Using Newton‚Äôs first law ‚Ä¶ we know that this is the worst case scenario
‚Ä¶ the fuel would have released at speed and engulfed all the buildings
‚Ä¶ and then exploded. The explosion would expand, due to the increased heat, to engulf the surrounding area. We know what to expect, when we see the crash site.
A blackened burnt out mess, with smashed aluminium covering a wide area of hundreds of meters. Let‚Äôs see what the crash site looked like:
 FBI supplied photos:  9/11 Attacks and Investigation Images  We can see:
 There is no debris field.
There was no fireball fuelled by 35,000 litres of vapourised jet fuel. We can see:
 An explosion had occurred at the front of the building.
A fire had started, and progressed along the right of the block. The block roof to the left is new, and completely clean‚Ä¶ untouched.
The blocks behind are clean and relatively untouched. Therefore, there was an explosion, and a normal building fire.
That‚Äôs all.
 (videos released show an explosion that is no different to a missile strike‚Ä¶ this would fit the visual evidence) A close up shows a similar startling view:  We can see:
 Green grass‚Ä¶ all the way to the point of explosion. ‚ÄòGreen Grass‚Äô!!!!!!! ‚Ä¶ and absolutely no debris field. With 100% certainty - we can say that this plane crash never happened There is no doubt.
No Boeing 757 crashed here‚Ä¶ with full fuel load or less. It was Fake News Yet we were told by all news agencies that this 757 had been hijacked by 5 Arab terrorists, and flown into the Pentagon on 11th September 2001 (9/11) 1 month later the western world went to war, in Afghanistan, and then Iraq. No engineer believes this story
When American engineers and architects retire‚Ä¶ their first task is to sign a petition to investigate this.
 AE911Truth Petition Signers No rational person believes this story
Airplanes, and enormous quantities of fuel, do not simply disappear. You may ‚Äòwish‚Äô to believe this story
This must be a reasonable strategy, because the alternative may be unpleasant ‚Ä¶ particularly for any person having no understanding of the history of ‚Äòforming public opinion‚Äô. How public opinion was formed in previous wars, would be useful knowledge to have‚Ä¶ it would certainly minimise the shock of the above. (please see notes below on formulating and sharing your reactions below) Senior US Army Major General‚Äôs viewpoint Major General Albert Stubblebine
Commanding General of US Army Intelligence (INSCOM) 1981‚Äì1984
32 Years service
 Albert Stubblebine - Wikipedia This video is primarily posted for those who wish to believe.
Stubblebine was in the same boat‚Ä¶ only that he knew too much‚Ä¶ he was in charge of army intelligence development before retiring.
 (just imagine his pain - you will cry, when he succeeds in not crying) For this venerable gentleman, his entry point was the above photos  (and he then proceeded as we all ultimately do) .
He made his own calculations‚Ä¶ different to mine‚Ä¶ he didn‚Äôt even look at the fuel (we assume)‚Ä¶ but he knew 100% that it wasn‚Äôt an airplane.
He also saw initial videos of the ‚Äòmissile strike‚Äô‚Ä¶ and then saw ‚Äòre-released images‚Äô showing an airplane edited in. It‚Äôs a painful video to watch for any US citizen (and all of us).  Global knowledge
 It is amazing, but true‚Ä¶ that there are still people around the world that disbelieve this fake news.
‚Ä¶ or is it? No major news organisation has accepted their error in transmitting it. For this reason‚Ä¶ I was disappointed with Jimmy‚Äôs answer.
He knows all this‚Ä¶ as everybody in the media does.
Yet they still keep quiet. That is the underlying problem of fake news It‚Äôs not silly stories, or the rush to get a story published. The simple fact is that the news organisations go with the flow.
They always have done‚Ä¶ and it looks like they always will. ‚Ä¶ at least until we teach the next generation to be critical of information that they receive.
‚Ä¶ and we should use the big examples like the one above, to show them what can happen. We can only hope that the next generation will do a better job than we did. :)  Counter argument at end, otherwise‚Ä¶ Notes for people having difficulty with the above information If you‚Äôve fallen upon this information for the first time‚Ä¶ it will be particularly shocking, whether you are rationalist or not.
If you are like me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd simply dismissed the 9/11 questions as being formed from nutters. Just one link (last year) dropped me in it
I was shocked to find that the educated class, was well aware of ‚Äòeverything‚Äô.
I was in that class, but for whatever reason, I‚Äôd refused to look. The fact that I hadn‚Äôt looked, didn‚Äôt really bother me‚Ä¶ however, for a month I was in a very dark place.
As an engineer, I had no fall back to disbelief‚Ä¶ and once each incident was examined, there was nothing that one could base any belief on (for the official story).
The entire enacted plan contradicts the laws of physics at every instance. My entry point was WTC Building 7
Apparently it is the traditional entry point, because you know the truth in around 7 seconds‚Ä¶ the rest is just the details. We all know that governments carry out ‚Äòfalse flag‚Äô operations‚Ä¶ but on this scale?
It left me‚Ä¶ ‚Äúfeeling bad‚Äù (my best description).
Others I know, have found themselves being violently ill. I spent the next month learning how it had been done
Not just the physics‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs really quick‚Ä¶ usually a few seconds or minutes.
Did a 757 and 35,000 litres of jet fuel slam into the pentagon‚Ä¶ er no.
It‚Äôs that quick, once you know what such a crash site looks like. Most of the research time was absorbed in the fantastic story of the graphics, sound tracks, and how the media played it. That‚Äôs how I dealt with it.
You may be different. I think we can say with some degree of certainty, that all the shrinks and analysts in America will be fully aware of what happened‚Ä¶ we presume that by now that they will have devised a way of helping you deal with it (at a price). What I can say, is that I don‚Äôt underestimate the pain.
It hurt me for a month, and I‚Äôm not even American. But what I do know is that the young‚Ä¶ under 25‚Ä¶ in my experience, it has no negative impact whatsoever‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just another piece of information about how the world works. Other than that‚Ä¶ if you do have any feelings about this, that might help others‚Ä¶  please add a comment below.

Please check out Andrew Browns comment below‚Ä¶ at time of writing it has 6 upvotes.
At first glance, you might think‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong with Andrew‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt he see the facts?‚Ä¶ and the 6 upvotes‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs going on? But once you step back; Andrew and his upvoters are likely well aware of the facts‚Ä¶ but they may support the Fake News objectives (in this case).
It got me thinking. Sure there is a large proportion of society that has no knowledge of what went on‚Ä¶ but once the facts are presented, few people genuinely reject them, other than out of reasons of ‚Äòself-preservation of sanity‚Äô  (entirely acceptable) . Here we are going to assume that Quorans are rational beings, and they can take the view that‚Ä¶ for the greater good‚Ä¶  the fake news scenario was a political requirement . So let‚Äôs go for it‚Ä¶  Empires come to an end Without revolution, the strong become weak.
This is 100% fact (history tells us so). But what if an empire reinvents itself , just when things are clearly going tits-up? There would be ‚Äòinsiders‚Äô that gain extraordinary financial rewards.
 (That comes with the territory) The plebiscite hates this (for obvious and correct reason), but it is what it is.
The winners are the incidental beneficiaries‚Ä¶ necessary to make the revolution happen
‚Ä¶ yet the revolutionaries themselves couldn‚Äôt care less, because they are anyway winners‚Ä¶ their ideology/goals triumph. America has created an empire It may be extremely short, in time-scale, but it is a fact.
 (change happens much quicker now - the empires throughout the ages got shorter as time progressed) We see a resurgent Russia, and an enormously powerful China (in financial terms and in population), that is increasingly beginning to flex it‚Äôs muscles. We can all see China taking over the South China Seas‚Ä¶ and from there‚Ä¶ what else?
China is cash rich.
The West is debt laden. However, Britain and America control the global financial system
 (if you don‚Äôt understand this‚Ä¶ do your research‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll understand the desire of the EU to wrestle control of the financial system from Britain) Either way‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how it is.
‚Ä¶ but to support the system‚Ä¶ it requires military might - projection of military power.
You can ask yourself‚Ä¶ why is it that britain is developing supremely advanced submarines, and why america is developing supremely advanced aircraft et al?
‚Ä¶ and why they work together in military deployment? But how to pay for it? Here‚Äôs Donald Rumsfeld explaining (and outlining the thinking behind 9/11):
The link starts with Rumsfeld giving the reasoning for the plan.
 (Note: if you watch the whole video, you‚Äôll also see the collateral winners)  So‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs It Like it or not‚Ä¶ the requirement for a new ‚ÄòPearl Harbour‚Äô was considered absolute. ‚Ä¶ and in terms of renewal of empire (military power)‚Ä¶ he was probably right. The fact that the rich are getting richer, and the plebiscite are increasingly marginalised‚Ä¶ is a function of policy. Could it have been managed another way‚Ä¶ surely it could.
But with the current ‚Äòelite at the expense of everybody‚Äô system in place‚Ä¶ the way to achieve the objectives could be easily achieved with money. You can imagine the conversation:
‚ÄúWhy not double up on your insurance‚Ä¶ and gain $6B‚Äù‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ fine! But all that is ancillary. The key issue, was to dump the old ordnance, and replace it all with high tech weaponry.
Also to get our soldiers into the field, because active service trumps training exercises  (by a country mile) . So there you have it ‚Ä¶ out of the horse‚Äôs mouth. No need to contort your brain around ridiculous scenarios that can never make physical sense. Rumsfeld is laughing at you, or with you. You are either: Unthinking person (never looked) Unthinking believer in government policy (never looked) Thinking believer in government policy (never looked) Thinking believer in government policy (looked & bought it) Thinking person that simply never looked (bought it) Thinking person that looked (it‚Äôs too much- refused) Thinking person that looked (recognises - Fake News) Judge the assessment above Splitting the population by 7‚Ä¶ we are looking at only 7 people out of 100 that actually care about 9/11. Note:
That statement is entirely casual.
Obviously I have no idea about how many people are in which category. I listed it like that, to highlight how easy it is to find that you are bizarrely alone.
You want to shout it out‚Ä¶ but every other twat is in the groups above.
:)  Suggested research methods (into this subject) Concentrate first on these incidents: Flight 77 - Pentagon Flight 93 - Shanksville World Trade Centre Building 7 These are extremely easy to understand.
We‚Äôve looked at the first two already (see comments)‚Ä¶ WT7 is also a no brainer. The twin towers is more complex, and as a result the web is full of analysis.
Some is first class, however I would recommend starting with Architects & Engineers‚Ä¶ and then the physics. AE911Truth Petition Signers  Physics  Moving to ‚Äòvideo analysis‚Äô also opens up a can of worms, in terms of theories as to how it (the video) was done, and exposing the glaring errors in the video.
Obviously there must be many errors‚Ä¶ the big ones are easy to see and often very funny - the BBC announcing the collapse of WT7 20 minutes before it collapsed is hilarious. That leaves all the theories for how it was all done‚Ä¶ building the picture. It‚Äôs a very enjoyable pastime, though quite time consuming.
I spent a month on it, and then left it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd seen enough.
This is the first time I revisited it in a year.

END  (for the moment)",https://www.quora.com/What-action-should-media-outlets-take-to-combat-fake-news,"There is one thing that you have to explain if you claim that the Pentagon was not hit by that plane. Where did that plane go? We know it took off; we know the passenger list; we know the grieving relatives - it seems to me that the conspiracy theory also needs to allow for that plane being dispensed with somewhere else - which to me is more difficult to believe than the accepted story that it hit the Pentagon. What about all the eye-witnesses in Washington that saw it hit? Are they all in the pay of whoever has conspired this conspiracy? Would the US Government really plan to fake a plane crash into the Pentagon, and kill many of its top military personnel into the bargain? I‚Äôm afraid that the simple explanation - that that plane did hit the Pentagon - is the true one. As for the physics - how did the destroyed aircraft engines and other aircraft debris get inside the Pentagon?","This answer made the hair in my neck stand up.

Fake News,How has fake news affected people in the modern world?,"There have always been newspaper gaffes, and journalists have never been error-free. But fake news is something else -- and much more dangerous: it is fictitious messages, which exploit the functional logic of social networks. Users can get upset at any time. Certain hot topics can be effortlessly instrumentalized: the fear of alienation, the abuse of power, questions of war and peace. In the German chancellery and in the parties‚Äô headquarters, fake news is among the biggest concerns. If something could negatively influence the election campaign, then most likely deliberately spread false notifications. For a society in which people are informed mainly through the media -- and form their political opinions through it ‚Äì this process is threatened when lies spread through the media. When it is no longer clear what is false and what is correct, people lose their confidence in the state. Is it true, what they tell me on TV? What I read in the newspaper? What I've heard on the net?

Crypto Currency,"If you‚Äôre supposed to buy low, why isn't everyone investing in crypto currencies right now?","Because most people don‚Äôt buy low. (Thanks for the A2A David!) Many researchers have looked into this phenomenon and they‚Äôve come up with many theories  why  this happens. I don‚Äôt know what explanation to believe, but the phenomenon itself is very well-established, and it‚Äôs been written about since ancient times. I‚Äôll elaborate in two ways‚Äîfirst, why people buy after the price goes up, and second, why people are not buying cryptocurrency right now (February 2019). Why do people buy high and sell low? It‚Äôs social and psychological. Social: you feel like an outcast or abnormal for doing something other people aren‚Äôt doing, something people tell you is a mistake, wrong, illegal, etc. On the flip side, when you buy when ‚Äúeverybody else‚Äù does, you feel connected. If you fail, so does everybody else. You have a shared bonding experience with other people. Psychological: your brain is wired to mimic other peoples‚Äô actions. This sometimes creates a feedback loop‚ÄîJohn, Jen, Jane all bought, you feel an urge to buy, too, therefore you will find a way to validate or justify my actions. Until there‚Äôs some fact or experience casting doubt on your decision, your mind can justify pretty much anything. Some chalk it up to fear and ignorance. Wall Street says it‚Äôs herd mentality. Others think it‚Äôs the notion of scarcity or fear of missing out, where you feel a sense of urgency to get yours before everybody else gets theirs. Maybe it comes from people‚Äôs craving for instant gratification, fast money that comes only when the price is at or near the top not when the price is low or falling. I‚Äôm sure all that plays a role. The bottom line is, facts have nothing to do with it. Both you and I fall into this trap all the time, often without even realizing it. We accept only those facts that confirm our feelings and ignore or rationalize opposing facts. This is why I hold only a small portion of my family‚Äôs wealth as cryptocurrency because I worry that I‚Äôm so concerned about looking for facts that confirm my belief in crypto, that I‚Äôm missing facts that invalidate my belief. I worry that the reason I can find only one good argument against buying crypto now is because I don‚Äôt  want  to find more reasons. (BTW the only good argument I‚Äôve heard: it‚Äôs possible no cryptocurrency will ever work well enough for anybody to ever use it.) Why aren‚Äôt people buying cryptocurrency right now (February 2019)? Because there‚Äôs no hype. Since the 2017 boom, we‚Äôve seen 900+ VC partnerships, 100,000+ new jobs, massive OTC volume, tremendous development, lots of new projects, several new investment platforms, partnerships all over, corporate implementations of blockchain technology, business usage of cryptocurrency, and several working, operational cryptocurrency networks. This is progress, experimentation, growth, and traction. Not hype. It is also irrelevant for 99% of people on earth because they don‚Äôt know about it. It‚Äôs not fun. It‚Äôs not interesting. Kids aren‚Äôt making YouTube videos about how many cars they bought for their garage using profits from selling cryptocurrency. Only 2‚Äì8 percent of people have ever bought cryptocurrency, depending on what survey you believe. If they are reflective of the people I know, they‚Äôre either traders keeping their money out of the market until the price turns, or HODLers who bought a small amount during the boom and are waiting for the price to come back so they can sell without feeling like they lost money. They‚Äôre wait-and-see. The other 99% of people I know either don‚Äôt care or ask me whether they should buy. Market sentiment sucks. Potential buyers are burned out, scared, apathetic, or think they‚Äôre smarter than the markets. Everybody else is anti-crypto and will probably never buy. At least, from what I see among my friends, family, and acquaintances. In speculative markets like cryptocurrency, only market sentiment matters. Reality is irrelevant. For people who stay tuned into what‚Äôs going on in cryptocurrency, this is reality:  For everybody else, this is reality:  Until that changes, people have enough going on their lives. Most people live check to check, hand to mouth. They‚Äôre not going to put $200 into anything that doesn‚Äôt give them money back now, whether that‚Äôs crypto or stocks or a savings bond. The idea of buying low makes no sense‚Äîafter all, in their mind, if you could get rich doing it, wouldn‚Äôt everybody? ***If you like this answer, please upvote and share*** ‚Äî Mark Helfman is a cryptocurrency commentator and author of  Consensusland: A Cryptocurrency Utopia .",https://www.quora.com/If-you-re-supposed-to-buy-low-why-isnt-everyone-investing-in-crypto-currencies-right-now,"people are not buying because they don‚Äôt have the patience for bitcoin anymore. this is understandable after it crashed from 20k to where it is now. at this price it looks like a bargain. however, it looked like a bargain at 5k and 6k. so where exactly is the ‚Äòbottom‚Äô? no one knows. it really looks like a dead duck. this same scenario is playing out in gold and silver.

Plantbased,What do you think about veganism?,"Truly, veganism is not a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù. It is also not a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù. There is a difference between one who is vegan and one who participates in ‚Äòa vegan lifestyle‚Äô or ‚Äòa vegan diet‚Äô. It might sound confusing. It can be. That‚Äôs why many people choose to use the word ‚Äúplantbased‚Äù when referring to the way of eating (‚Äúdiet‚Äù) or way of living (‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù‚Äù), particularly when such are devoid of the moral aspect. The difference is in the morals. If a person is eating a plantbased diet to improve their own health, they are following a plantbased diet. The same is true for people who eat a plantbased diet for environmental reasons. A person who is who is following a plantbased lifestyle, which extends to maybe their personal care products or their clothing, who is doing so for any reason other than morality, is following a plantbased lifestyle. A vegan realizes that is wrong to exploit another being simply because one can.

Solar Energy,Why are solar panels so inefficient? What is stopping us from harvesting 80-90-100% of solar energy? How efficient are the most efficient plants?,"Original Question:
 Why are solar panels so inefficient?
What is stopping us from harvesting 80-90-100% of solar energy? Price and technology. You may say now:
 ""But the second law of thermodynamics? You can't go more than 30-35%, can you?‚Äù Wrong.
60% to theoretically 100% efficiency is possible - 60%-90% has already been achieved. As often: take a step back and take a new perspective:
Forget photons. See light as an electromagnetic wave. Think of energy transmitting with electromagnetic waves. But one thing at a time:
Your phone's wireless charging device emits electromagnetic waves. The mobile phone receives them.
The efficiency of this energy transmission is about 60%-80%. Not ideal, but well over 20%-30%.
Take a look at a transformer. It can transmit energy with well over 90% efficiency. The theoretical limit of efficiency for energy generation from electromagnetic waves is an amazing 100%. All we need for receiving the energy is an antenna and a rectifier. A ""rectenna"". All we need for a 100% efficient solar cell is an antenna for light waves and a suitable rectifier. Sounds simple, right? And now to the challenges: The Antenna
An efficient antenna should be as long as one wavelength of the wave to be received to resonate. For visible light this is between 380 nm and 590 nm. Nanometers are billionths of a meter. This is complex. But it is already feasible with nanotubes, at least for one wavelength. But since white light is a mixture of different wavelengths, we need a forest of nanotubes of different lengths between 380nm and 590nm. Difficult, not impossible. The rectifier
The fastest common rectifiers operate at frequencies up to 50 GHz. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave ""light"" is between 500.000 GHz and 800.000 GHz. That is hard. A rectifiers threshold voltage is around 0.2 - 0.6 V. This is too high for the mini antennas.
Not to forget the parasitic capacity, which reduces the efficiency. This explains why you cannot yet buy these solar cells in the shop. But:  successful laboratory samples exist; in the net I found e.g. the company ""NovaSolix"", which is dedicated to this technology. If this research is successful, these solar cells should not only have a much higher efficiency, but also be much cheaper. The next revolution in energy production. Thanks for reading!

Solar Energy,Why isn't solar energy used more commonly in India?,"What do you mean by common? I am assuming that it means that why isn't it seen on most of the roofs. Reasons for this are:- 1. High cost per unit for the residential properties thus greater break-even period.
2. High cost per unit compared to Coal (though parity is in sight)
3. Governments need to incentivise solar roof tops. Fortunately Delhi announced a feed-in tariff recently, which is a great news and will revolutionize Delhi's solar market.
4. Unawareness among masses. People aren't aware of the benefits that they can enjoy over a period of time using various solar powered systems.
5. Costly setup - On an average, the system costs around Rs 1 lac/kW (about $1800/kW). This figure deters people from investing in such systems. Now assuming that you mean that it is not used as much, then I would say you are wrong. The scale at which solar power plants have been set up across the nation is outstanding and worth a praise. I worked for Welspun (now Avaada Power), and we have set up about 400 MW of solar power plants till date. This is just one company, so you can imagine the capacity added. But there are constraints to this also. They are:- 1. Land - 5 Acres/MW approx is required. So you can imagine the land requirement.
2. Low efficiency: This also contributes to larger land requirement.
3. Low reliability: This is literally 'bhagwaan bharose' ('by God's will) system. It depends on sun and if there is no sun, the generation is significantly low. This doesn't mean that it will be performing at best efficiency in noon (because the max efficiency of panel is generally at 25/27 deg C temperature).
4. No storage options for power.
5. Big investments and longer break-even period: For a MW you need upto 10 crores, and this price comes down as we increase the scale of plant. For a plant bigger than 10 MW, average price comes to around 6-9 cr. And average break even periods are 7-10 years. But the banks and investors are very positive for renewable systems. So expect it to penetrate the Indian markets even deeper.

Crypto Currency,What's the best way to short crypto currencies?," Use a margin trading platform and ‚ÄòStop-Loss‚Äô orders. Short-selling is a method that‚Äôs generally tied to margin trading because it is made possible by lending the amount you wish to short (sell) from a crypto brokerage on margin. The margin is the amount that is required as collateral to enter the desired position. For example, in order to short 2 BTC (approx $10,000 USD) the minimum amount you would be required to deposit is $100 with 100x leverage. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using 100% of the available margin so that you have some buffer funds in case the trade goes badly and wish to modify the order to avoid being liquidated prematurely. Alternatively, you could invest more of your own funds and use less leverage also, which reduces the risk of the trade. Either way, when you short cryptocurrency it should be with a short-term strategy as crypto markets are far too volatile to survive anything more when trading this way as price movements are further magnified. Be sure to set a  ‚Äòstop-loss‚Äô  or  ‚Äòtake profit‚Äô  order also to minimize your loss potential.

Solar Energy,Why can't we get solar energy from space?,"In order to make the energy useful, we have to essentially have a concentrated beam of the captured sunlight sent to Earth to a receiver. This energy could be converted to different wave lengths of light, but pretty much has to be light. There is no other way to transmit energy (radio waves, microwaves, wi-fi signals; these are all different wavelengths of light). You need a form of transmission that does not scatter. Radio waves tend to radiate in all directions, even when focused as a beam it still scatters. Less so as the wave gets tighter (such as microwave beams). But best of all is using a beam of coherent light, which does not scatter at all.  A space solar array that collects enough energy for a city concentrates all of that energy into a beam of coherent light (a laser) and then shoots that down at a receiving station. That station then has to convert this super-powerful beam back into electricity to send to the city's buildings. Should the laser be off target (the biggest concern), it would incinerate any building it passes over. Might just generally affect the weather too, since it has to pass through the atmosphere to get to the receiving station. Also, we have not yet invented laser beams this powerful. And converting it back into electricity is a big challenge. But at this point we are worried about the dangers of the transmission, which is why little work is being done.",https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-we-get-solar-energy-from-space,"And on top of all that, it would need to be cost effective to build the infrastructure.

Solar Energy,What is the tipping point for solar energy and how close are we?,"The tipping point has been reached IN CERTAIN LOCALES. The tipping point for solar is often hit when the cost of electricity generated by a typical solar installation in an area beats the cost of traditional generation plants run on coal or natural gas in that same area. For simplicity's sake we'll just assume we aren't counting externalities such as pollution from coal, because these are not only difficult to calculate but have also been traditionally ignored in the past (understand this is changing, particularly in places where they have already instituted carbon taxes). When this ""grid parity"" is hit, consumers are likely to be incentivized to install solar due to cost savings. A further incentive is the possible social recognition and individual pride in replacing fossil fuel generated power with solar. Now, there are cases where the tipping point can been reached without even being in the neighborhood of grid parity. Germany is the perfect example. Germany so heavily subsidized solar installations that the country installed many gigawatts of solar capacity despite significantly higher costs of solar at that time. On certain days Germany now actually generates up to half its electricity from solar power, despite being a very poor location for solar irradience. This poor solar irradience and the high cost of solar modules during the 2009-2011 period led to a market distortion since installations would never have taken off without government mandate. This mandate was not necessarily a good thing because the high costs of solar generation are now being passed on to end consumers of electricity (homes and businesses).  Today solar installations in many sunny locations are at or near grid parity. Solar modules and inverter prices have come down dramatically due to large amounts of industry supply that were brought online and due to technological/manufacturing advances. Balance of system costs (permitting, labor, etc) are also being targeted for reduction by large scale installers as well. This recent paper mentions that in California SCE and PG&E are getting applications for solar installations that deliver electricity at rates under $0.10/kWh: www.bnef.com/WhitePapers/download/82 Rates at these levels are below retail electricity rates in certain areas, particularly during times of peak power usage. As mentioned in other posts, LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) is the metric most often used to benchmark or compare the cost of different types of power generation because it closely matches up with what the consumer of electricity ultimately pays for power. There are other metrics that utilities use as well, but LCOE is widely cited. What affects LCOE? Location/irradience (how much sun a place gets), module and inverter efficiency, system costs (everything from cost of materials to install labor costs etc), the life and speed of degradation of the system, maintenance costs of the system, etc. There are many variables that ultimately determine the performance and cost per kWh generated by a system over its life. Most can be reasonably estimated based on historical data. Ultimately it is widely believed that a solar LCOE under $0.10 is the magic number to drive large increases in installation volumes.  Even when this number is reached, the tipping point may still not be surpassed. Solar installations do require upfront capital, with the savings coming ratably over 15-20 years. This cash flow profile is not attractive to many non wealthy residential power customers because they may not have the upfront capital. This is where firms like SolarCity, SunRun, and Sungevity are coming in to provide the upfront capital in exchange for monthly payments from the home/building owner. This is essentially how you pay for your power now, except that with solar leases payments will be much more fixed than they are with traditional power.  For these reasons, I think we could see the tipping point reached for wide scale residential solar installations in the next 1-3 years here in the US (especially in the Southwest US).  (Note: There are many other considerations such as utility grid capacity, regulations, and developer capital/returns on capital that can affect a potential boom but I don't see them meaningfully altering the trajectory in the near term)",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-tipping-point-for-solar-energy-and-how-close-are-we,The LOCALE thing is critical.

Solar Energy,How long will my solar energy system last?,"Properly maintained, your solar system (assuming it is solar PV, not something else), should last for greater than 25 years.

Things I worry about over long periods of time are cables, connectors, metal mounting structures that might rust. All things fairly easy to fix if caught before they cause a problem. At some point, solar modules will start failing (failed bypass diodes, mechanical failure of the seals, letting moisture in, etc). You will likely be able to replace them very cheaply, relative to the price you paid 25 years earlier, as the costs continue, and will continue to go down on solar panels. You may have a challenge fitting a replacement into your system electrically or mechanically depending on how the system was designed and what technology is available in the future when a failure occurs. I personally plan to visually inspect my system every 5 years or so, and I monitor the product regularly (using the web monitoring portal provided by my inverter company) to make sure nothing is wrong. Solar installation companies will do an inspection of your system - and it shouldn‚Äôt cost much - just a few hours of labor. You really don‚Äôt have to worry about a solar system. They are pretty much ‚Äúset it, and forget it‚Äù. But, a little bit of preventative maintenance could save you potential problems down the road.",https://www.quora.com/How-long-will-my-solar-energy-system-last,,,,,
Solar Energy,What are the main barriers to widespread adoption of residential solar energy systems?,"The biggest barrier to the adoption of PV is  power density,  which equates to  cost.  Yes- geography, efficiency, financing models, paperwork, education/culture, and all the other reasons given in other answers here are contributing factors. All of these amount to added costs of installing PV. In real terms, solar installations are an economic decision based on the installed cost in  dollars per watt.

 Dollars per watt = Dollars per area installed cost / power generated per area in watts

If your solar cell is producing more watts, the dollar cost to market, spec, install, and operate your cell is lower.  Simply put:  solar cells need to have a higher power density  in order to be cost effective and see widespread adoption. The solar irradiance on earth is roughly 1,300 W/m^2 maximum. Typically it may be only 800 W/m^2, say. Even at 30% efficiency, a solar panel thus generates 240 Watts per square meter at its peak. To install a system on a home's roof, say 2 square meters generating  480 Watts peak , at  $1/Watt  (this low cost is needed to give a short payback time that allows easier financing models and affordability to lower income homes), would require the entire thing to cost only  $480 -- that is the cost of the PV cells, the balance of systems, and the installation. This is incredibly low. The only long-term solution is not just to increase the efficiency of solar cells, but to find inexpensive technologies to improve their  power density   by an order of magnitude.  Low cost drives adoption.  The only other way payback times can be improved is with a higher levelized cost of electricity, meaning if the price of a kWh on the grid was more expensive. The only way this is possible is through widespread, massive fuel supply shortages (not happening anytime soon with grid fuels like coal or gas) or a  cost of carbon.   If power density cannot bring us to a solar world, then perhaps cap and trade or a carbon tax can.  Today less than 0.1% of electricity in the US is generated from solar power. Solar farms total only a few gigawatts, and residential solar installations have 10-20 year payback times (depending on geography) and have largely only been installed by individuals looking to ""go green."" Take one step out of the Bay Area, for instance, and speak with people who make purchasing decisions on energy systems-- from factory managers, to building engineers, to home owners-- and you'll find quickly, as I have, that energy is simply too cheap for anyone to change their behavior significantly for at high cost.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-barriers-to-widespread-adoption-of-residential-solar-energy-systems,,,,,
Solar Energy,Who are the big players in the solar energy industry?,"Here is the list of the top 10 solar companies in the world: Jinko Solar The list begins with the world‚Äôs largest solar panel manufacturer and that too by some margin. In 2017 alone, the Chinese firm shipped a massive 9.81 GW of solar modules globally. The firm started out as a modest wafer manufacturer back in 2006 and in a decade, has become the biggest solar module manufacturer in the world. Our research told us that Jinko Solar plans to better its 2017 tally and ship about 13 GW of solar modules in 2018. Trina Solar Here is a company that holds somewhat of a significance as far as the Indian context is concerned. Of all the solar rooftop solar projects in India today, most of the panels have been supplied by Trina Solar. In fact, Trina is India‚Äôs biggest supplier of solar equipment of all international companies that do business with India. While the exact sales of the Chinese firm for 2017 were hard to find, what did come up in our research is that as of 2014, the firm had shipped a total of 11 GW of solar modules. Canadian Solar Canada has laid a lot of emphasis on the use of solar energy. And as a result, Canadian Solar, which is a publically traded company has emerged as the biggest solar company in the Americas owing to a highly favourable business environment. The firm also marks as the only presence from the Americas region. The company has manufacturing facilities scattered across Canada, Latin America, and Asia with Canada and China being the biggest units. JA Solar The Chinese government provided a subsidy to JA Solar and since then the company took off on the global stage. Following the attractive subsidies by Beijing, a lot of investors from the world took interest in JA Solar and that helped the firm‚Äôs net worth skyrocket. Based in Shanghai, the company is engaged in the production of solar cells and modules that shipped across Europe, Americas, Africa, and Asia. Hanwha Q Cells Headquartered in South Korea‚Äôs capital Seoul, is the youngest company on this list as it began operations only in 2015. However, in less than three years, the South Korean firm has thrust itself among the pioneers of solar technology. Q Cells caters largely to the demanding European and Japanese market as of now. But with two huge manufacturing plants under its belt, it has plans to soon enter new markets. GCL System Integration Based in the Chinese province of Hong Kong, GCL-SI was founded in 1990. Since then, the firm has grown leaps and bounds. As of now, the firm boasts of a 22.2 per cent market share in the silicon market and supplies a shade under 30 per cent of the total global wafer capacity wafer yield. Longi Solar Joining the list is yet another Chinese firm that has shown vested interests in manufacturing solar modules in India. The firm recently announced that it has plans to set up 1 GW solar PV manufacturing facility in Andhra Pradesh. As of now, the company aims to manufacture a total of 45 GW of monocrystalline wafer production capacity by 2020. Shunfeng This Chinese company is one of the most prominent solar energy companies in the world mainly due to its solid repo in manufacturing solar cells and solar modules. Through a strategic expansion process, the company has acquired several firms and that has given it the capital and infrastructure to manufacture solar equipment. As of 2014, Shunfeng completed the production of about 2.4 GW of solar modules. Kyocera Kyocera is a Japanese multinational firm with a particular stronghold in the global solar market. Among an arsenal of things that the firm manufactures, its solar equipment is considered to be its best produce. Currently, Kyocera is manufacturing solar power generating systems. Yingli Finishing off the list is another Chinese firm that is renowned across the globe for its solar panels. In fact, industry sentiments suggest that solar panels made by Yingli are among the best in the world. The firm started operations in the year 1997 and for two years in a row, in 2012 and 2013 was also the number one PV module manufacturer in the world. So there you have it. As evident from the list, China‚Äôs clout in the global solar market remains as strong as ever. A business friendly government in Beijing has really pushed the nation‚Äôs solar equipment manufacturing prowess to such a level that there are not only those Chinese companies that make solar panels and modules for other companies, but also those companies that are Chinese in origin who do their own work without any outsourcing. New Delhi should look at Beijing because there are a lot of lessons that can be learnt from the Chinese.

Solar Energy,What is the best use for solar power?," Photovoltaics are getting closer to 40% efficient every year. But its not the hammer, its the carpenter. For decades the naysayers have said costs, storage and daylight hours were the downfall of PV as a potential solution. Now batteries are amazing (and getting better every day), prices have dropped while quality has risen and ‚ÄúThe Grid‚Äù is communicating with the new energy efficient homes and the electric cars to level out peak demands while providing nighttime needs.  Soon schools will be delivering kids on electric buses powered by the sun and the utility companies will jump into the new PV revenue stream to provide them the shade. Same for the kids in the high school parking lots driving short-range EVs. The electricity will power the schools and recharge the cars. Imagine the price drop and the efficiency ratings once the retail, workplace and grocery store parking lots are coved in PV and mass production becomes a thing‚Ä¶without needing 30 days on a ship from a foreign manufacturer.

If you say a story is  incomplete , you‚Äôre implying that the news organisation hasn‚Äôt done enough to cover the story properly. If you call something  inaccurate , you‚Äôre commenting on the ability of the news organisation to portray a story properly. If you call it  incorrect , you‚Äôre saying they messed up.

Crypto Currency,Why was crypto currency created?,"Ten years ago, Bitcoin emerged as the first cryptocurrency. A lot has happened since that day ‚Äì we would like to take a look back at some of the major events during this time period. Before the cryptocurrency tale began. The idea of having a digital currency is not a new one. Prior to cryptocurrencies, many attempts at creating one have taken place. The main issue most of them were facing, was the double spending problem. A digital asset somehow needs to be useable only once to prevent copying it and effectively counterfeiting it.
Over 10 years before cryptocurrencies, the concept had been introduced by computer engineer Wei Dai. In 1998, he published a paper where he discussed ‚Äú B-money ‚Äù. He discussed the idea of a digital currency, which could be sent along a group of untraceable digital pseudonyms. That same year, another attempt by the name of  Bit Gold  was drafted by blockchain pioneer  Nick Szabo . Bit Gold equally looked into creating a decentralized digital currency. Szabo‚Äôs idea was spurred by inefficiencies within the traditional financial system, such as requiring metal to create coins and to reduce the amount of trust needed to create transactions. While both were never officially launched, they were part of the inspiration behind Bitcoin. The birth of Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. 31 October 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto published the  white paper called  Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System , describing the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain network. This day in Bitcoin history has carved the path for the events that followed. 3 January 2009: Satoshi Nakamoto, whose true identity remains a mystery to this day, mined the first block of the Bitcoin network, effectively piloting the blockchain technology. The first mined block is also known as the  Genesis Block . 22 May 2010: The first recorded purchase of goods was made with Bitcoin when Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. This day is still commemorated to date as the  Bitcoin Pizza Day . At Ledger, we celebrated this with a  limited edition Ledger Nano S . The start of a cryptocurrency market  Source:  coinmarketcap.com March 2010: First cryptocurrency exchange  appeared in the name of  http://bitcoinmarket.com  (now defunct). In July that year, Mt.Gox was launched as well. 2011-2013: Bitcoin managed to reach  parity with the US Dollar  in February. During this year, a few  rivaling cryptocurrencies emerged : By May 2013, the cryptocurrency market counted 10 digital assets, including Litecoin. Another major crypto asset joined in August in the name of XRP (Ripple). The Mt.Gox disaster June 2011: Mt.Gox got hacked for a first time : 2,000 BTC was stolen, having a value at around $30,000 at the time. 2013: Mt.Gox  became the largest cryptocurrency exchange , at its peak handling 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. February 2014: Mt.Gox became the  first major  cryptocurrency exchange hack , having 850,000 BTC stolen from it. This is the largest theft of BTC in Bitcoin history, which was valued at $460,000,000 at the time (current date value near $3 billion). Read more about the infamous hack in  this article . 2014-2016: Bitcoin  price plummeted by 50%  and did not recover to its initial price till late 2016. Cryptocurrency exchange hacks have remained ever-present since, though rarely of Mt.Gox‚Äôs caliber. Ethereum: and the introduction of ERC-20 tokens.  30 July 2015:
The  Ethereum  network, currently the number 2 crypto asset in terms of market capitalization,  was launched . It brought smart contracts to the cryptocurrency world.
 August 2015:
 First  Initial Coin Offering  (ICO)  took place, being the Augur crypto asset. Like many others, the Augur ICO used the Ethereum network‚Äôs smart contract. Cryptoassets created through Ethereum‚Äôs smart contracts are generally known as  ERC-20 tokens . 2015 ‚Äì present: More and more ERC-20 tokens have been created. There are  currently over 1000 ERC-20  tokens with a market capitalization. From there on. The cryptocurrency world has not stood still since. Prices reached an all-time highs in the beginning of January 2018 and many new crypto assets have joined since, including EOS (July 2017), Tron (September 2017) and Cardano (October 2017). The cryptocurrency market currently hosts over 2000 digital currencies and is still expanding.

Crypto Currency,What is responsible for crytocurrency fluctuations?,"Since cryptocurrency is a volatile market, it carries risk. The perceived store of value of cryptocurrency against fiat currencies is one reason why it may vary against them. The most significant point of comparison in the cryptocurrency vs. fiat currency argument is their backing. Fiat currencies are supported by central governments, and their worth is derived from the fact that the central government declares that they have value, and then the parties dealing in the value place their trust in them. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, were created to prevent the central government from having the authority to regulate an individual's funds. And, because they have a set supply, inflationary devaluation is absolutely non-existent.

Or perhaps he doesn‚Äôt see a point in talking about it. That might change if bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrencies rise parabolically again, or if bitcoin‚Äôs total market cap approaches the total market cap of gold (where the price of bitcoin would be about US$500,000). But my guess is that it probably wouldn‚Äôt. A lot more money is traded for stocks, bonds, commodoties, futures and (especially) foreign currencies than cryptocurrencies, but it seems that Trump‚Äôs pronouncements have all been about the stock market and, to a much lesser extent, the value of the dollar.

In other words, they simply report the news as it unfolds.

MSNBC is FOR sure biased to the left but anchors have been known to criticize progressives such as Obama for NOT being ‚Äúleft‚Äù enough.

The country is essentially a centrist country with progressive leanings, and for this reason we have seen a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù shift over the past 50 years that includes Civil Rights,Voting Rights, empowerment of women, a stronger EPA to save the planet from Climate Change (now being gutted by the insidious Trump administration), an expansion of Civil Rights as it relates to the LBGT community, etc. CNN does feature Republican commentators, some of whom I respect, most of whom are little more than shills/surrogates for Trump. I view CNN as a mainstream network that reflects the true values of the majority of Americans AS WELL as the global community. Fox ‚ÄúNews‚Äù is absolutely NOT a news channel or network, by their own admission. In other words, Fox is ‚Äúmarketed‚Äù as ‚Äúnews‚Äù but essentially has become ‚ÄúState Run Media or ‚ÄúTrump TV.‚Äù Ask Sean Hannity if he is a journalist and he will answer, ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm an entertainer.‚Äù As the Access Hollywood tapes broke before the election, I did see brief coverage of it on Fox but the issue was never addressed again subsequent to the initial ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù and because of their marriage to Trump, it is rare to ever see ANYTHING negative on their air relative to Trump. They are his voice, and in fact, Trump is known to confer almost every night with Sean Hannity and in fact, much of his policy is driven by the extreme right wing fringe elements that found their way onto the Fox network, spreading conspiracy theories by the likes of the now disgraced Alex Jones. Ironically, the WSJ is OWNED by the same man who owns Fox, Rupert Murdock. While that is a Republican leaning newspaper, the ‚Äújournal‚Äù of Wall Street, presents largely fair and balanced news, though in the age of the internet, some writers cannot be wholly trusted due to the scaling back of editing. The NY Times remains the most revered and respected newspaper in the world today, and while some may insist (due to indoctrination by Trump) the NY Times is ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù the claim is ludicrous and preposterous AND dangerous. Do they ever make a mistake in reporting? Absolutely! But when they do, they quickly issue a retraction and PUBLISH it replete with apology once the error is discovered. You‚Äôll not see that from Fox.","MSNBC, completely left leaning but trustworthy, much more honest than Fox. CNN, more middle of the road and trustworthy.","Prior to Trump‚Äôs presidency, Pew Research did a study, which found that Fox News was 45% news, and 55% opinion. MSNBC came in at 15% news, and 85% opinion.",Trump even admitted in one of his own tweets that ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù just means ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like that‚Äù.,
Solar Energy,How to extract solar energy at night?,"It‚Äôs a little out there, but two words:  Space mirrors This is pretty much what the moon does; it reflects the sun‚Äôs light, and the reflected light illuminates the Earth so it‚Äôs not always 100% pitch black outside at night. So even just by the light of the moon, you could technically get solar energy at night, but significantly less and it would vary by the phase of the moon. If you could put up mirrors in orbit and set up a way that they always direct sunlight to your solar panels without falling into the Earth‚Äôs shadow, you could produce solar energy all night. Additionally, any nearby area illuminated by these mirrors around the solar panels would never fully experience night, as the sun (or part of it) would always be in its sky and the ground would always have the sun‚Äôs energy illuminating and heating it. The downside is this would require a lot of engineering and possibly even constant control of the mirrors to pull off. On a grander scale, if you have large enough mirrors and find a way to keep them in place behind the Earth, but not eclipsed by it, you could theoretically remove the entire concept of night from the planet. Depending on how far these mirrors are from Earth, they might also make the moon always in its ‚Äúfull‚Äù phase. This would cause the whole planet to be absorbing the sun‚Äôs heat all the time, and without being able to cool down at night, the entire Earth would heat up indefinitely and all life would burn. Fortunately, nobody who would do this has access to the materials that would be necessary to make this happen.",https://www.quora.com/How-to-extract-solar-energy-at-night,,,,,
Crypto Currency,Which is the best crypto currency?,"Sure thing, the best and the most crucial crypto is Bitcoin. However, you have to understand many other great coins are essential for the market. The second best to Bitcoin has to be Ethereum. Ethereum is a decentralized software platform that enables the development and operation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dapps) without the participation of a third party. Ethereum's goal is to create a decentralized suite of financial commodities that anybody on the planet, regardless of nationality, race, or creed, may freely access. This feature makes the penalties more enticing to folks in some countries. Those who lack state infrastructure and formal identification may be eligible for bank accounts, loans, insurance, and a variety of other financial products. Ether, the platform's unique digital currency, powers Ethereum apps. Ether serves as a means of transport over the Ethereum network and is mainly sought after by developers looking to construct and manage apps within Ethereum, as well as investors looking to purchase other digital currencies using ether. Ether, which launched in 2015, is currently the second-largest digital currency by market value behind Bitcoin, albeit it lags well behind the leader. Ether's market value is roughly half that of Bitcoin, with the currency trading at around $3,600 per ETH in September 2021. In 2014, Ethereum held an ether presale, which got a massive reaction, ushering in the initial coin offering (ICO) era. Ethereum claims to be able to ""codify, decentralize, secure, and trade almost anything."" Following the 2016 decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) assault, Ethereum was split into two coins: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Ethereum's consensus mechanism was changed from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in 2021. (PoS). This change is designed to allow Ethereum's network to function with significantly less energy and faster transaction speeds and create a more deflationary economic climate. Proof-of-stake enables network users to ""stake"" their ether to the network. This procedure aids in the security of the network and the processing of transactions. Those who do so are rewarded with ether, which functions similarly to an exciting account. This is an alternative to Bitcoin's proof-of-work system, in which miners are rewarded with extra Bitcoin in exchange for processing transactions. However, you have to understand that another coin could be ""the best"" for you. You should be very cautious in choosing the ""correct"" currency in terms of investment or trading. And if you want to be successful in trading or investing in crypto, you should follow the best signals. I have been following the signals from  https://www.fatpigsignals.com/signal-results/  since I have started working with crypto.",https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-crypto-currency,,,,,

Long term, ethereum‚Äôs value will only increase as it becomes more widely used.

Hence, it is ‚Äúuser friendly‚Äù particularly for those new to crypto investing and do not want to manage multiple wallets. 2) With its current price-hovering around $35 (vs Ethereum $240 and Bitcoin $2400) Litecoin is less likely to induce ‚Äústicker shock.‚Äù 3) Volatility - Bitcoin‚Äôs high volatility has been a source of criticism and reason for investors to shy away.

Crypto Currency,What is the best strategy for reinvesting daily profit from crypto currency?,"Somewhat more advanced, but I personally like to hedge with a diversified portfolio and leverage. If you margin trade with leverage you can free up more capital so that you can hedge investments and reduce the risk of adverse price movements. There is a risk-reward tradeoff inherent in hedging; while it reduces potential risk, it also chips away at potential gains. However, when used in collaboration with leverage the greatly enhanced profits tend to outweigh the small losses - because you only need to outlay a fraction of you‚Äôre funds as the collateral to enter the trade. For example, you could enter a long position on the BTC market, while simultaneously placing a short position against it. Say you deposited $100 with 100x leverage on both positions, they then both become a $10,000 position with significantly increased profit potential. Obviously, only one will prosper while the other one will lose. But the profits are multiplied by 100x, while the loss is limited to the $100 deposited. You might consider the loss of $100 a fair trade-off for the enormous potential of the flipside gains. Furthermore, if you don‚Äôt want to place all of your eggs in one basket, you can invest in a variety of crypto-assets at one time also to diversify your portfolio. In crypto, there aren't many exchanges that feature high leverage and short-selling opportunities, and those that do tend to only offer their highest leverage to BTC and less to other altcoins. The best crypto trading platform to access the mentioned, more advanced strategies is Prime XBT, with 100x leverage on all of the  top 5 cryptos .",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-strategy-for-reinvesting-daily-profit-from-crypto-currency,,,,,
Crypto Currency,Why is blockchain technology important beyond crypto currency?,"According to the  TICbeat  website, in an article published in February 2018, these are the 6 uses that can be given to the blockchain: ""Signatures and contracts One of the main problems associated with the signing of agreements is the possible manipulation of documents to try a scam or legal fraud. However, these fears of a potential conspiracy against us are dissipated from the base by incorporating the blockchain into the equation, since the information stored in the chain of blocks cannot be altered in any way. And not only that: to be able to store sensitive information in a secure and encrypted way, we can use blockchain-based solutions to house our personal documents, such as the driver's license or the different licenses we need in our day-to-day life. Thus, if it is necessary to identify ourselves, we will only have to show the precise data, with all the guarantees that the information is correct and without having to disclose personal data that hold our documents and that are not necessary in the majority of cases. Health and safety Thanks to the benefits of connected medical devices, the chain of blocks can help the health industry by solving the waste of time, money and duplication of processes that the current distribution in different facilities and suppliers supposes. Given the difficulty of hacking and altering the information encryption system, the chain in blocks will allow patients' medical records to have greater privacy and security. Accessing this network of transactions by third parties without access will be practically unthinkable. But the blockchain does not remain only in the efficiency of medical systems; it can also help in the prevention and fight against diseases, especially infectious ones. For example, when a specific pathology is spread, and it is suspected that it is transmitted through contaminated food, the block chains allow complete traceability of the origin of the bacteria and determine which products are affected to remove them much faster than if it requires research to use.  Image Source:  https://www.las2orillas.co Logistics Ensuring the identity of the physical property and the shipments will generate a great business opportunity during the next decade, with the incorporation of high-value solutions with blockchain components in the logistics supply chains and regulated industries, such as energy, pharmaceutical products, and the cold chain. Here we already see some pioneering projects: Bosch, Cisco, and many other companies have created a consortium to take the blockchain to the connected devices that are used in logistics or energy; while Nestl√©, Unilever, Tyson Foods and ten other North American companies along with IBM technology have teamed up to explore how the blockchain can help monitor the food supply chain and improve the safety of these consumer products. Taxes Can you imagine that we can forget to present the cumbersome tax returns? One of the secondary possibilities of the blockchain is to be able to automate all fiscal tasks, avoiding in the process human errors, thanks to which the Treasury will have access to our financial data and act accordingly, without having to go crazy. Of course, when all the information is obtained from a chain of blocks that is 100% safe and unalterable, there is no way for someone to be tempted to evade taxes or cheat our beloved 'State Dad.' International transfers We promised to offer five cases far from the currency field, and maybe we were a bit daring (or liars). But its primary use in our society is to take advantage of the speed, security and traceability advantages that these blockchains already offer to bitcoin to exploit money transfers on an international scale. Currently, this process can take up to days, but with this technology, we could reduce the waiting time to just minutes while maintaining the same reliability standards that are demanded on these occasions.

Crypto Currency,Which crypto-currency has the most scalable architecture?,"No altcoin is currently scalable.  Ethereum is probably the only project that has all the incredients to make it work: funds, a huge development team, a roadmap, plans got how to scale it, as well as support and backing from corporations and institutions. What is needed to massively scale? There are three different scalability problems that must be addressed for massive scaling. This applies to every altcoin. The storage space it needs on full nodes.  Fortunately, many newer coins are already scalable because they have built-in pruning functions, and HD space is getting rapidly cheaper. The upload bandwidth needed to propagate blocks.  The smaller the blocks, in theory, the faster the propagation; however, coins with a low time-interval between blocks carry a higher orphaning risk. The download bandwidth and CPU capacity needed to download & validate the blockchain.  This is a major problem if we talk about huge user bases (>10-20 million users) and 1TB+ blockchains. This will be the biggest issue with scalability. A support for decentralized sidechains is the best solution, because with sidechains not all nodes have to download every block.",https://www.quora.com/Which-crypto-currency-has-the-most-scalable-architecture,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What metrics do you use to evaluate a crypto currency?,"Now is a pretty good time to draw a line connecting stock certificates to cryptocoins. IPOs to ICOs. If now, there is seems a huge difference between the two, then please recall the nature of common stock issued for companies we called  Dotcoms  back in ‚Äò99. That said, the very best way to evaluate cryptocurrencies is the same way one would judge holding, buying, or selling equity: Try to establish utility (make/save money, save time, perform needed function with greater convenience) Estimate customer base Estimate annual earnings Estimate growth rate of earnings Estimate the total number of coins  issued and outstanding  now and in the future (say annualy) Either, pay no more than 1 > (P/E)/(growth rate of earnings) * simply put, pay 100 x Earnings for company growing at 100%/Year or more Or, use Ben Graham‚Äôs work and back into a valuation with a spreadsheet deriving value from current interest rate levels and EPS and growth rates.

Fake News,How can you use blockchain to discredit fake news?,"Most pieces of news are about people. In the other cases, people are involved as confirming agents. So focusing on people's built history is the way to go. We build our history by noting what's happening. We can do this, with everyone else too: that's to be a social algorithm. There's still a long path to go before a social algorithm shall come into existence, which shall help people record what's happening around them and then hash it into a layered blockchain. One layer is minutiae at the level that might interest a stenographer or anthropologist. Another layer is abstract and summary: a record of what's deemed to be worth recording for posterity by those who participate by being there in real life. Building the record at this level is like building conference proceedings or meeting minutes. Most of our time is spent in clusters of people. These are like meetings. When there's a clear start and end time the ""meeting"" is time-bound so it's easy to build or record what one sees, notes, observes and to cross-correlate this information with others' notes, in real-time. Easy but not yet done. Under other circumstances it's also feasible to get people to cross-correlate but this is harder to achieve in my opinion. The reason for my describing two layers is that most people would like to have at least two layers: one that is largely to be forgotten, and one that is largely to be remembered. The latter can be made to be easier to retrieve. Other cultures have two layers in their most basic terminology: e.g. for noted minutiae, French has ‚Äúproc√®s-verbal‚Äù which includes notes on non-verbal elements. French has another term for the next level higher up, minutes or proceedings, summary of personal exchanges and interactions, as well as grouped actions, steps, stages, progress, changes, etc. It‚Äôs ‚Äúcompte-rendu.‚Äù To be able to discredit fake news we‚Äôll need to have access to a blockchain, and find one of the input-makers present onsite when its information was created.

Fake News,Is it fake news that fake news is so prevalent?,"‚ÄòFake news‚Äô is prevalent! The first proposition in beginning to understand the prevalence of fake news, is to abandon the term ‚Äòfake news‚Äô as it doesn‚Äôt adequately represent the complexity of the problems. ‚ÄòFake news‚Äô must be further defined to represent the severity of the issues it perpetuates because unfortunately the term is easily politicized.

Solar Energy,Are perovskites the future of solar energy?,"Perovskite cells in theory could achieve 87% efficiency. But there is a solid track record of things taking quite a while to go from R&D to commercial production. And a substantial risk of that technology having serious problems with durability or large scale production. Also the risk of key patents being bought off by fossil fuel interests to prevent them from reaching the commercial market. So until the first  Perovskite cells hit the market, and are tested in real world conditions for a few years... I wouldn't bet on them. Plenty of battery technologies have been the lab sensation of the moment as long as 5 years ago, yet to hit mass production. However if we could get  Perovskite cells at even US$ 0.50 / WattP but with 50% efficiency, that would substantially reduce cost to install solar. Current 18% efficient solar panels have 300WattP power. The same size panel with 50% efficiency would have 800WattP power. That means that installing a reference 10kW array would need 12 panels instead of 33. The least panels required, the lower the total overhead cost. It would also change the game for tall buildings. A 50 story building produces too little power even if the whole ceiling is blanketed with current top of the line 20% PV, but at 50% efficiency the same space produces 150% more energy. High efficiency panels also make 2 axis tracking panels economic (follow the sun east-west on a daily basis and north-south on a seasonal basis) 2 axis tracking usually increases average production by a 1/3 (but its too expensive for low power panels, but make economic sense for high efficiency panels). Current Solar PV is very affordable for installation at end users with net metering arrangements. But those are very bad for electricity distributors. They have a significant cost to expand and maintain the grid connexion to each end user, and end up forced to buy solar generation and sell it back with zero profits. Solar needs to be cheap enough that end users will be happy to have solar even if they sell electricity at half the price they buy. And that price point is still many years in the future (another halving in solar costs), also solar in sub tropical places are significantly less productive on a yearly basis (might produce a little more kWh in the summer, but output is almost insignificant in the winter, and that's assuming owners are willing to clean solar panels after every snow storm !). The other aspect is when solar is so cheap it costs less than just the fuel consumed by fossil baseload plants, it will push fossil plants out of the market for much of the day. And wholesale electricity usually costs less than 20% of retail prices. Without heavy subsidies there would be NO wholesale solar generation except for markets where electricity comes from diesel / oil sources (very expensive). This also requires somewhat affordable GWh scale energy storage, so solar + storage could power the whole grid in the summer. We need solar PV to drop from current US$ 0.5 / WattP down to US$ 0.2 / WattP to achieve wholesale viability without any subsidies.  Perovskite PV might be the key to getting there.",https://www.quora.com/Are-perovskites-the-future-of-solar-energy,"In the US up to 50 % of PV are so-called ‚Äòsoft costs‚Äô related to labor for installation, permitting, design.

And there I found out about Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology, why it can benefit society, what you can do with it, and with smart contracts that can be designed on top of it, and the disruption that it could cause to all industries. The possibilities and the applications and uses were endless. I was hooked.",https://www.quora.com/What-got-you-into-crypto-currencies,,,,,

Crypto Currency,When or will crypto-currencies collapse?,"Anything digital can be hacked, corrupted, stolen, or deleted. Governments do NOT like currencies they can‚Äôt control. They will tell you it is because of drug trafficking or other illicit dealings, but the bottom line is governments want to control money because it is an easy way to  control   you  and  tax   you . So governments don‚Äôt like crypto-currencies and they don‚Äôt like cash for the same reason. Both are under attack. If both cash and crypto-currencies can be controlled or eliminated, the government can tax anyone, anytime, anywhere, any amount. If your money only exists in a credit card account you can even be taxed on money you are  saving . This is called negative interest rates and it‚Äôs happening in some countries already. This pushes you to spend your money or watch it waste away over time. Negative interest rates and inflation are government theft. When the government controls money to that degree, they can control what you buy, when you buy, how much you buy, where you travel, even whether you can buy. Here is a link that explains why the government wants to eliminate cash:  Why Governments and Banks Want to Eliminate Cash, Explained By Noted Economist Dr. Scott Sumner So either governments will take over crypto-currencies or they will outlaw them. I can‚Äôt predict a time, but it will happen as soon as a way is figured out. Here is a link that shows several countries and their laws concerning crypto-currencies:  What the World‚Äôs Governments Are Saying About Cryptocurrencies In the meantime, governments are slowly taking cash out of our hands, eventually leaving us with only credit cards. We won‚Äôt complain because credit cards are convenient. Through credit cards, every aspect of our lives can be controlled.

Fake News,"Why aren't ""fake news"" simply called ""lies""?","Because, as another writer says here, they are not lies (though Donald Trump would love to label these stories such), but are honest reports by journalists (and, God, does he hate journalists), that Trump chooses to dismiss as ‚ÄúFake News,‚Äù because he doesn‚Äôt like them. It‚Äôs an appalling phrase that Trump has maddeningly put out into the world, (not to mention that other one, ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù (what?!), because it discredits serious journalism, and can be bandied around carelessly by anyone who doesn‚Äôt like, or cannot handle the truth - like Donald Trump.

Fake News,What is WhatsApp doing about fake news?,"Whatsapp is a messaging application. The app does not generate any news or any information really. It only serves to send your texts and media to another person. Whatsapp has end to end encryption and stores all messages on your device. Technically speaking, no one else along the way should be able to see your messages once it leaves your device. The only way for Whatsapp to prevent fake news would be to read every message from everyone and use special algorithms and verification techniques to check if that link your friend sent you is legitimate or not. This is not feasible as it is a violation of privacy of the users. On the other hand, Facebook generates news stories, hosts news amongst other things. This can be managed without much ordeal. You would still need all the verification of stories, but it is easier to do since it can be verified before appearing on your feed and no privacy issues during this process either. And this is exactly what Facebook has been doing in order to reduce fake news. I hope this clears things up!",https://www.quora.com/What-is-WhatsApp-doing-about-fake-news,,,,,

Solar Energy,Can solar energy power the world?,"In theory. Enough energy does reach the earth from the sun. The problem is collecting, storing and delivering it when it‚Äôs needed. I myself have doubts enough solar and batteries could be produced to meet an ever increasingly energy hungry world. However it is not without it‚Äôs uses. Most houses in most latitudes have enough roof area that with solar panels and a reasonable sized battery they could be energy independent taking that burden off the grid. If the battery is big enough it‚Äôs also possible that each home could also charge it‚Äôs own EV taking that burden off the grid too. Larger urban centers consume large amounts of power though. In the future I myself believe the best thing would be modern designed nuclear power as base line with solar/battery farms taking over the place of gas and coal peaker plants. It‚Äôs also not unreasonable that when demand is lower (say at night) the nuclear plant(s), rather than lowering output could charge the batteries that the grid would use during the day in the peaker capacity. This would allow batteries to be put in cities without having them depend on solar.. at least in the larger urban area‚Äôs.",https://www.quora.com/Can-solar-energy-power-the-world,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What are the possible reasons to ban crypto currency in Nepal?,"Thanks to  Aadarsha Bajagain  for A2A. I wrote and wrote and wrote many thinng and now I don‚Äôt want to delete them. Hope some of you will make it till the last paragraph :) Previously  For a farmer to sell his vegetables in the market, A  whole-seller  used to collect vegetable that costs  Rs. 50  in  52 rupees  from the farm. Whole-seller then sells the vegetable to a  dealer  who collects all vegetables from many whole-sellers at 55. He than sells the vegetables to our shops nearby in 60 rupees. And different shops sell those 50 rupees worth vegetables at any rate they want. The Price ranges from 65‚Äì70. Dis you notice how many middleman are there who actually play a decent game and earn from the farmer‚Äôs product? And what value does a farmer gets for investing weeks to produce that vegetables? The farmer is getting only four percent benefit while those middle men easily earn 15‚Äì20 percent for just speaking. And also the price margin that exists in our market. A new customer will never know that he is paying 100‚Äì200% more. HOW CAN WE STOP THIS? WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM CAN SOLVE THIS? BLOCK CHAIN   CAN RIP THINGS APART. It can stab those bribers‚Äô heart apart and squash all the middlemen. BITCOIN is a digital currency which actually runs under the principal of block chain. After using BITCOIN the process for selling vegetable by a farmer will be something streamlined like this: Farmer marks its margin say  X-Bitcoins The Wholeseller won‚Äôt play any role in selling price. They are now the disrtibutors and will get money for carrying the good and distributing it to the retailers and shops. The cash transaction will be done via Bitcoin. And the Product‚Äôs quality and quantity will be controlled via BLOCK CHAIN. It mightn‚Äôt be cleanly applicable for vegetables. But let‚Äôs generalize the product as a digital content. The content sold by it‚Äôs creator will be unique and will be hashed(private encrypted key which are not easily breakable.) So the guaranteed products will be bought and sold(hash keys makes it possible) Transaction will be done via Bitcoin so straight transfer will be possible between seller and buyers. Sellers selling price will also be publically available on a open journal that is maintained by the BlockChain. So nobody can smart out anybody. Isn‚Äôt it what we all want? But you might ask why bitcoins while we have banks to do so? Then my answer will be like this: Like in the farmer‚Äôs vegetable selling story I mentioned above: even BANKS are some middlemen. And they are legal bodies who are certified to make income from the money that citizens earn from doing hard work. The bank and corporate polities are more dense than a spider‚Äôs net. Once we are inside it will be hard to escape. And so are the governments. My only point for supporting BITCOIN as of now is this: Government is corrupt. We keep paying bills every single month. But where does those budget that government announces every year goes? Why are there huge pot holes in a Highway which should actually be black paved. Why are there no infrastructure of Development (Education Health, Transportation) decentralized to the remote areas? So why to pay TAX to such government who doesn‚Äôt pay back to it‚Äôs citizen . This is when I support bitcoin and do one-to-one  transaction and keep the product and its value(give -return) within two body, but not any middlemen(corrupt government in this case) There are some other reasons which puts me in favor of Using Bitcoin. But there are certainly some downside and some of them are discussed below: Do we have in-depth knowledge about Cryptocurrency and what it is?- I don‚Äôt think we do. Do we know if we can fully trust on some digital currency? -  I don‚Äôt think we do. Do we have a promising Cyber Law that can take full responsibility of digital transactions or the fraud that are probable in future? -  I don‚Äôt think we do. Have we practiced such thing before or even have a bullet proof well researched plans which could give us confidence to give Cryptocurrency a try? -  I don‚Äôt think we do. What percentage of a country‚Äôs total population are using internet?- Very Low What skill sets those online citizens have in order to browse internet? Coz most of the citizens browse facebook and youtube and don‚Äôt know how to send an email. What are the actions that we will take if any illegal activities like (Drug Smuggling, Child Pornography, Gun Dealing) takes places with the help of Cryptocurrency? First how can we know if any such activities are occuring online? Do we have enough resource, knowledge, plans and promulgation ready ?  I don‚Äôt think we do.

The easiest for my favorite crypto, BTC, is localbitcoins.com. Simple site. You sign up for an account, look through the ads, and make a deal. You want REALLY easy you make a deal to buy with Western Union. Once the deal is made the seller puts the agreed upon amount of BTC into escrow, you send the agreed upon amount of money via the WU website, using your credit/debit card. You tell the buyer when that is done (many will want to retrieve the funds from WU before releasing escrow; that‚Äôs okay, it puts them at ease so they know you‚Äôre not going to reverse the payment); then, they release the escrow; which puts BTC directly into your wallet on that site. You‚Äôll want to have your private wallet ready since one of the cardinal rules of crypto is that we NEVER leave money on an exchange (the ONLY thefts I‚Äôm aware of in the crypto world were exchange ‚Äúhacks‚Äù; many of which were inside jobs; but, the fact remains that if 100,000 people are using a website; someone, somewhere will fail to keep their account secure; giving hackers a way to everyone‚Äôs money; so, just don‚Äôt do it).

Bitcoin / BCH/ABC/SV will be a interesting 2 years ahead. This could see some dramatic turns. But after 2 years, I think it would be foolish to predict that any of these would not be around. They will be in some form or the other in existance. The price may be very low, very high or anywhere in between. If it goes much lower, probably wont be around so much, and maybe hashpower really turns off and goes back to being cpu minable - but just typing that, you know its highly improbable - but not impossible. We started with tiny hash rate, trading at fractions of the dollar.. no reason it cannot return.

What number of various ways would you be able to buy cryptocurrency on the trade? Do they acknowledge bank exchanges? Charge and Master cards? Scarcely any locales acknowledge PayPal as a substantial installment type because of the high danger of deceitful exchanges (stolen accounts, etc). Geology. Does the trade have any geological impediments? Some digital money trades just serve clients in specific areas. Websites from where you can buy cryptocurrency is ¬∑  Coinbase Coinbase was one of the principal sites to give you a chance to utilize your financial balance to purchase cryptographic forms of money. While in fact Coinbase is an expedite, their trade auxiliary Coinbase Pro (once in the past GDAX) handles exchanging.

And the rules were: No killing, stealing, cheating, lying, do not even think about doing any of that, AND children obey your parents. Then Charles Darwin wrote his book. Karl Marx wrote his book applying Darwin‚Äôs ideas to government. Socialism divided into subsections. Social Darwinism, social communism, and social corporatism. The communist called the social corporatist: fascist and right-wing. When the class warfare of communism failed. The communist migrated to the western Europe and North America.

Fake News,"Should social media filter out ""fake news""?","Fake news is not a new phenomenon, but it has gained a lot of attention in recent years due to the invention of modern technologies and social media platforms. It has become a lot easier for fake new to be presented to audiences as the factual, unbiased truth. Things like clickbait headlines and subjective journalism have allowed for fake news to become even more prominent in society. The spread of fake news is a large issue on social media sites and search engines like Google, Twitter and Facebooks. These sites are some of the greatest disseminators of fake news, without even being actual news outlets. After the recent massacre in Las Vegas, the alt-right online news platform ‚Äò4chan‚Äô created a completely false profile for the shooter, claiming he was a liberal who had recently converted to the Islamic religion (Romano 2017). Filter bubbles then allowed for this information to reach the top page of Google, as well as reach a top spot in Facebook‚Äôs newsfeed without there being a single accurate detail in the article. As detrimental as fake news stories can be to the public‚Äôs understanding of current events, the spread of false information is something that is required to keep running, and so it is not social medias responsibility to filter it out. In  How America Lost Its Mind , Anderson quotes Edward Bernays, who claims that ‚Äú‚Ä¶the very essence of the democratic process is the freedom to persuade and to suggest.‚Äù (2017) This is what fake news does‚Äîit persuades its audience to believe their subjectively true stories. In saying this, it is not social medias responsibility to weed out fake stories, as that can be seen as going against the very essence of Western democracy, as well as going against the right to free speech, and will cause more commotion than its‚Äô worth. As Benedict Carey notes, ‚Äú‚Ä¶it is the interaction of the technology with our common, often subconscious psychological biases that makes so many of us vulnerable to misinformation, and this has largely escape notice.‚Äù (2017) Even if these platforms are able to fact check every single post and every single article being shared, misinformation can still be spread based off of the users‚Äô individual biases and how they interpret the information based off of thing like their race, gender, social status and education among other factors. Due to pressure from the sites users though, Facebook and Google are trying to fight the epidemic of fake news by introducing ‚ÄúTrust Indicators‚Äù as a way to verify the facts and reliability of the sources (Carbone 2017) Facebook is working hard to stop the spread of fake news, but it should not be its responsibility. It should be the responsibility of the news outlets, as they are the ones projecting the information out into the public. Platforms like Facebook and Google are merely the messengers. Samidh Chakrabarty (the head of civic engagement at Facebook), stated that ‚ÄúIn the public debate over fake news, many believe Facebook should use its own judgement to filter out misinformation. We‚Äôve chosen not to do that because we don‚Äôt want to be the arbiters of truth, nor do we imagine this is a role the world would want for us.‚Äù (Keach 2018) This is a fair stance. As previously mentioned, it is not Facebook that is explicitly sharing fake news, but it‚Äôs the users and algorithms and filter bubbles that allow for fake news climate to thrive. They are taking on the tasks of fixing that, and that is all they should do. They cannot be gate keepers; Facebook worker have their own biases and should not have any way to promote their own agendas. Having the platforms filter out fake news allows for their biases to shine and will keep the public from other information. It creates an entirely new problem surrounding censorship rather than fake news. Works Cited Andersen, Kurt. ‚ÄúHow America Lost Its Mind.‚Äù  The Atlantic.

It‚Äôs been like this many times but I eventually go back when I feel up to it. a common reason I hear is that they don‚Äôt want to be annoying militant vegans. These mind their own business and to others it‚Äôs not always obvious they are vegan. All because they can‚Äôt face the riddicule of their friends and family, I suppose. Since ‚Äúvegan‚Äù isn‚Äôt a protected term, people who are told to eat plantbased by their doctors also tell others how they are forced to be vegan for their health.

Solar Energy,Should solar energy nationalize like fossil fuels?,"In my opinion, it would be challenging to do so. The sun is more universally accessible across the planet whereas fossil fuels are discretely distributed: i.e. some areas are more fossil-fuel rich than others (Persian Gulf, etc.). I‚Äôd like to also respond to Eric‚Äôs land use calculation citation from NEI (the major nuclear industry lobbying group in the US), It is severely misguided, I‚Äôm sorry to say. To provide an alternative perspective, let‚Äôs do a simple thought exercise using statistics from the US regarding land-cover and energy usage both electrical and future electrified sectors (transport, heating.) Current  electrical usage  across the CONtinental United States (CONUS) :  3,845 TWh/yr Electrification of  transportation  across the CONUS assuming driving statistics and fuel use from the National Highway Transportation with improvement of efficiency gained from moving from Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) to electrical drivetrains:  1,850 TWh/yr Electrification of  heating  for both the residential and commercial sectors across the CONUS using statistics from the EIA and accounting for the thermal>electrical efficiency gain in the same manner we did for transport:  1099 TWh/yr In total, meeting 55% of the 6,794 TWh (3,845 + 1,850 + 1,099) of electrical + electrified transport + heating demand per year will require  3,465 GW of PV capacity  at the weighted average capacity factor of 18.4% across the CONUS. Let‚Äôs say the remaining 45% comes from wind and other (indirect-solar) renewable sources like wind and biomass. In total, the solar land use will require  17,326 km^2 of surface area  or ( 0.22% of the total CONUS surface area ). Let‚Äôs put this in context in relation to the existing land-cover uses across the CONUS using the National Land Cover Database. Below is a pie chart showing the percentage of land occupied by various land-cover types across the entirety of the continental US.  As can be seen, t he 0.22% required for 55% PV energy penetration of not only current electrical demand but also future electrified transport and heating is less than 1/10th of the land we‚Äôve already developed  : i.e. the land already covered with impermeable surfaces‚Üí parking lots, roads, buildings, etc. Sure, nuclear energy doesn‚Äôt take up as much land per kWh but (a) it‚Äôs not like you can distributively integrate fission reactors across building rooftops, as parking/road canopies etc., (b) in the context of the land we‚Äôve already developed, it is minimal. tl;dr ->(1) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible for PV to nationalized given the widespread resource availability and (2) Don‚Äôt read industry lobbying firms‚Äô publications to learn about their competition: too many vested interests.",https://www.quora.com/Should-solar-energy-nationalize-like-fossil-fuels,,,,,
Crypto Currency,"Why is bitcoin gaining currency where so many other crypto-currencies have failed? Is it timing, or a technical innovation?","The universe of previous crypto-currencies was limited to variants of the Chaum and Brands protocols where a centralized issuer 'mint' had to validate no double-spend and then re-issue the tokens. eCache (http://themonetaryfuture.blogspot.com/2010/03/interview-with-ecache-operators.html) was a flavor of this also. Ben Laurie had lucre (https://github.com/benlaurie/lucre#readme). Other digital currencies that failed were not even crypto-currencies. The Chaumian protocols for anonymous digital cash were commercialised via the Digicash patents and the normal bank/processor/regulator politics got in the way of any sustainable roll-out. It didn't matter though, because despite more rigorous anonymity and untraceability features, its centralized design would not have allowed it to survive in the era of arbitrary State shutdowns. It was always destined to be a State-sanctioned system. Welcome to 2009 (or Dec 2008 for pre-release). Enter bitcoin -- a fully decentralised p2p digital currency that prevents double-spend without a central issuing mint. Bitcoin's genius is that it is built on stable cryptographic primitives with the added new feature of the RPOW block chain for distributed trust. Paul Bohm gets it right here (http://paulbohm.com/2011/06/17/bitcoins-value-is-decentralization/).",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-bitcoin-gaining-currency-where-so-many-other-crypto-currencies-have-failed-Is-it-timing-or-a-technical-innovation,"Per the article, the value of Bitcoin is expressed as an intangible.

The replacement value of the bridge is 10 million dollars but the bridge conjures into existence billions of hours of human productivity over it's service life joining communities for the making of art family and new ideas. The bridge and every act of human invention suffers the same fate.  Market Capitalism does not have an accounting system for intangibles - only tangibles - the crap that get spit out the tail pipe not the rich palette that goes in.  Seems to me that the expressed value of Bitcoin is still a patch to the fundamental problem that we don't have an accounting system for intangibles.  This video discusses how to reorganize society for intangible assets at which point ""proof-of-work"" and ""proof-of-performance"" become synonymous as a means of conjuring a new value coin into existence....

Crypto Currency,What are the possible areas of applications of Blockchain/ distributed ledger other than crypto currency?,"There are so many, we are really spoilt for choice. Blockchains are nothing more than distributed ledgers copied onto each client computer that shares in the storage of that ledger. So that means that no one can fudge the facts on their copy of the ledger because all the other copies would bear out the truth. So, let‚Äôs look back a few short years to the financial crises of the last decade, based on greedy bankers fudging the value of mortgages based on the fact that the risk associated with those mortgages were easy to obscure. If mortgages were coded onto a blockchain, which recorded the risk factor associated with each mortgage cleanly, it would not have been nearly as easy to hide garbage tranches of mortgages amid the good or prime loans. Also, tracking ownership in a world where data can be replicated and distributed without reguard to property rights is potentially more managable if that data is distributed through a blockchain. Or medical information, encrypted. The information available anywhere because it is coded onto a blockchain but obscured by encryption until you share your private key with a hospital that is caring for you in a foreign country. Yourallergy to penicillin, blood type or a million pre-existing test results available immediately so that you can be cared for with minimal invasion, cost and maximum efficiency. That is why AICoin (which is in itself a cryptocurrency) is such an exciting venture. AICoin‚Äôs profits are used to fund early stage blockchain businesses, whatever they may be! So exciting.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-possible-areas-of-applications-of-Blockchain-distributed-ledger-other-than-crypto-currency,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What do you use crypto currencies for?,"Currently, cryptocurrencies are mainly good for one thing - speculation. Due to blockchains inherent limitations, that‚Äôs the only widespread use I‚Äôm afraid. While different groups have proposed a variety of solutions to scale the networks, there is one underlying flaw; blockchain simply can‚Äôt scale to the levels required if it is to act as the backbone of the financial system, let alone the multitude of wider use cases it is currently attempting to tackle. If it can‚Äôt scale to meet this anticipated demand then the unspoken truth is that the technology is unfit for its purpose. Blockchain‚Äôs overriding achievement is that it solves the issue of how to guarantee trust between two unrelated parties without the need for a centralized third party. This was what it was designed to do. Blockchain does not, however, have a magic bullet when it came to processing transactions. PayPal can handle around 200 transactions per second (tps). VISA considers itself able to process 56,000 tps, although average daily loads are closer to 2,000. Bitcoin is capable of ~7 tps, Ethereum 15-20 (less if it is tokens rather than ETH being transferred). This puts the networks well below the mere replication of one payment processor‚Äôs output, leaving the dream of mass adoption (which will require not just tens but hundreds of thousands of tps) well out of reach.",https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-use-crypto-currencies-for,"Do your homework before such embarrassed statement post again. More and more blockchain capable to transact much higher than CC to theoritcal future million tps. Even the slowest BTC has verity of solution at work, few has launched.

Crypto Currency,Why do currencies fall and rise?,"Basically, most rich countries and many countries that are not rich employ a ‚Äòfree-floating‚Äô exchange rate regime. That means that they allow the foreign exchange market to determine the rate of exchange and do not routinely intervene in the process. In this case, the exchange rate is determined by buyers and sellers of the currency: Importers need foreign currency to acquire goods -> imports put downwards pressure on the currency Exporters earn foreign currency and need a local currency to pay wages and taxes -> exports put upwards pressure on the exchange rate. The money your country‚Äôs businesses & government borrow from abroad is in foreign currency. They need to convert it to local -> foreign investment pushes local currency up The money your countries businesses & individuals invest abroad has to be converted to foreign currency -> investments abroad pushes your currency down. Capital gains sent abroad push the currency down. Capital gains received from overseas push the currency up. That‚Äôs basically it. So if, for example, goods that your country export become cheaper your country‚Äôs currency will depreciate. This is the market signal for local businesses to ramp up exports and cut down imports. Difference between imports and exports is usually called ‚Äòtrade deficit (surplus)‚Äô. If you add to it the difference between capital gains sent abroad and received from abroad, you‚Äôll receive something called ‚Äòcurrent account deficit (surplus)‚Äô. Difference between investment from abroad and investment abroad is called ‚Äòcapital account surplus (deficit)‚Äô. The sum of the capital account balance the current account balance is called ‚Äòbalance of payments‚Äô and if your country is not intervening in the currency market it is zero. However, we can go slightly deeper in the medium run. If your country‚Äôs central bank sets interest rate at, say 5%, and the Federal Reserve of the United States has set the interest rate at 2%, it becomes very profitable to invest in your country. Since pure arbitrage (borrow money in the US at 2%, invest in your country at 5%, and earn free 3% of profit) is impossible, your country‚Äôs currency will have a tendency to depreciate at the speed of about 3% per year. This observation only holds if your country has relatively open capital markets (does not have too onerous rules to prevent this manipulation). Furthermore, it is somewhat less useful than it seems, since day-to-day variation in the exchange rate can be far greater than this 3% difference, so usually, this observation only makes sense in countries with very unhealthy currencies and sky-high interest rates. The whole idea is called ‚Äòinterest rate parity‚Äô Generally, if the country has higher inflation it also has higher interest rates in the long run. Thus, if your country has higher inflation than the US, then the currency will depreciate relative to the dollar.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-currencies-fall-and-rise,,,,,

Crypto Currency,What are some of the successful implementations of Blockchain technology outside of crypto currency?," The use cases of blockchain technology are not limited to digital currencies, which are epitomized by Bitcoin. Since this technology can provide increased transparency, fairness, and cost reduction for businesses, blockchain is having a notable effect on different sectors. Some of the successful blockchain projects outside of cryptocurrencies include; Smart Contract Applications Burst iQ This project's big data blockchain-based contracts assist patients and doctors in Denver, Colorado, to transfer sensitive medical information in a secure way. The smart contracts create the parameters of what information can be transferred and even show the details of personalized health interventions for every patient. Propy Located in Palo Alto, California, Propy is an international real estate marketplace characterized by a decentralized title registry framework. This digital marketplace employs blockchain technology to facilitate the real-time issuance of titles and provides properties that can be bought using digital currencies. IoT Applications Filament Based in Reno, Nevada, this company offers software and microchip hardware that allows linked devices to run on the blockchain. Filament‚Äôs offerings encrypt ledger information, disseminate real-time data to other blockchain-linked machines, and permit the monetization of these machines in connection with the timestamps. HYPR This firm is based in New York and specializes in preventing cyber safety hazards in IoT devices using its decentralized solutions. Through the removal of passwords from a centralized server and replacing them with biometric and password-free solutions, the firm makes IoT devices virtually impossible to breach. Logistics Applications DHL Shipping multinational, DHL, is leading the way when it comes to the utilization of blockchain-based logistics. Essentially, the firm employs this technology to maintain a digital ledger of shipments and preserves the integrity of transactions. Maersk Based in Denmark, but with branches all over the world, this shipping conglomerate is collaborating with IBM to incorporate blockchain technology in global trade. The two forms will utilize this technology to better comprehend the supply chain and track commodities online across international jurisdictions in real-time. These examples highlight some of the industries beyond cryptocurrencies that are harnessing the resourcefulness of blockchain technology. However, it is essential to note that successful projects are not limited to the ones highlighted.

Crypto Currency,What countries will favor Crypto Currency the most?,"What are you asking? Which government will favor crypto currencies or which country‚Äôs people will favor crypto currencies? A government will embrace crypto-currencies once it can regulate and tax it‚Äôs use.  Japan  and  Australia  I believe are in the forefront of this movement. The  United States  and the  European Union  have already placed the necessary regulatory structures in place to accomplish this goal. A population will embrace crypto-currencies for several factors. To enable the unrestricted and monitored movement of wealth and good through a black market economy. Because they have little access to normal supplies of currency,  North Korea  produces a lot of Bitcoins and launders them through fronts in  South Korea . Many South Korean and Chinese investors have also taken advantage of the lack of regulator controls in an effort to avoid paying taxes. The recent dip in crypto-currency prices is the result of announcement by officials from both countries indicating that they intend to regulate these markets. Also, in some places where the economy is in turmoil, the income provided by bit mining provides a steady income where none was previously available. In  Venezuela , there are small-time miners operation covertly producing enough income to feed families while their economy continues to implode. To take advantage of crypto-currencies as an investment vehicle. In this case, almost  every nation  is liable to adopt the use of crypto-currencies. To enable their consumers to access crypto-currencies as a ready and convenient source of electronic payment. I‚Äôve seen this mostly in those nation that have already placed the appropriate regulatory controls in place. In  Australia ,  Japan , and the nations of the  European Union.

Solar Energy,Why do governments choose wind turbines instead of solar energy?,"‚ÄúSolar would be more landscape friendly‚Äù Ummm, false. Wind turbines take up about 1% to 2% of the ground surface and you can do lots of stuff like farm between them. They have no negative impacts to the ground. Meanwhile, solar has to cover the entirety of the surface so you can‚Äôt do much around it. Amusingly, one of the things which does co-exist well with solar are wind turbines. ‚Äúand have less negative impact on tourism than those huge wind turbines.‚Äù Ummm, false. There are no negative wind turbine impacts on tourism. Solar is awesome, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs getting to be as cheap as wind and will get there in the next handful of years. But oddly, the wind blows at all hours of the day and night, very predictably, and the sun doesn‚Äôt. They are complementary. Add hydro and a couple of other renewable sources as well as continent-scale grids and you have a robust system with multiple forms of generation, which is pretty much exactly what you want. The real question is why any government still supports fossil fuel generation over wind and solar. Why not poke at that question instead of asserting things about wind energy that just aren‚Äôt true?",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-governments-choose-wind-turbines-instead-of-solar-energy,Not quite sure on the complementary aspect.

Wind turbines you can see from far. For sure tourisme will halter. The scenery is gone! While if you choose for solar panels they would only be visible when you are closeby, the negative effect would not be that big. Therefor I don‚Äôt agree with your statement.","Aesthetically it‚Äôs a toss up and a matter of taste. Do you want obvious machines viewable over the horizon, or ground-hugging equipment dispersed ubiquitously?","I've spent my career as a power plant developer, covering most technologies, including wind and solar. It is very site dependent as to whether solar or wind is a better fit. As pointed out in the original reply, a number of sites are very suitable for both wind and solar. As for stakeholder impacts, these are also site dependent. Undoubtedly, wind has more significant visual and acoustical impacts. Solar is also generally more scalable with most developers favoring large wind installations where land availability and public acceptance allow for it.","Put panels on every roof,and they would be invisible.

Fake News,Was Michael Flynn's resignation a result of liberals shamelessly spreading fake news about him?,"You have surprisingly little faith in Trump. On one hand you think Trump is a strong and independent president who will fight the liberal media bias. Now you think that he's willing to fire people when the liberal media says mean things about him. Make up your mind. Either Trump is firing him because there are legitimate conflicts of interest involved, or Trump is firing him because he's scared of being told off by Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell EDIT:  Alright it looks like some Trump supporters don‚Äôt understand the dilemna. Let me explain this explicitly. 1. Trump dumped Flynn because the liberal media‚Äôs attacks were too much for him to handle. On one hand, the liberal media successfully damaged this country by sabotaging a highly competent government official‚Äôs career. Therefore you score points by showing how bad they are. On the other hand, Trump is easily swayed by the words of the liberal media. In fact, since they can so effectively manipulate his movements he‚Äôs going to be their puppet. 2. Trump dumped Flynn because Flynn lied to his boss. On one hand, Trump is simply doing a routine firing of someone grossly unfit to do a job (lying to your boss,  letting him defend you in public ).

Crypto Currency,Are investors abandoning gold for crypto currencies?,"This is an underlying trend that we can see intensifying since October 2020 and the start of the Bitcoin Bull Run which saw its price reach almost $65K in April 2021. Many investors are realizing that Bitcoin is a more suitable reserve asset for the future world where everything will be digital. Buying Bitcoin makes more sense today than buying gold for many people as a hedge against the great monetary inflation we are experiencing. After reaching a record high above $2,000 in the summer of 2020, gold has now been stagnating for several months at around $1,750 an ounce:  In contrast, Bitcoin is approaching its April 2021 ATH of $57.4K. This trend should continue to intensify in the months and years to come. It seems clearly unstoppable. Initially, Bitcoin's goal will be to surpass silver's market cap, which is very close at $1.276T:  After that, it will be time to go after gold's market cap. This should happen within the next decade. As you can see, the growth potential of Bitcoin is phenomenal for the next decade.

His name is William Shockley. He along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain were awarded the Nobel prize in Physics. I mention this, as Shockley was involved in many areas of semiconductor physics. In fact, the answer to your question is the  Shockley‚ÄìQueisser limit . This theoretical limit tells us that the efficiency of a single semiconductor cell is limited to 33.7%. The best panels available today have an efficiency of a bit over 20%. Not bad, all things considered. There is a balance between cost, ease of manufacture, reliability, size, material, durability, and performance. Know that we could use multilayered panels to obtain efficiencies greater than 33.7 percent. However, we end up back at the design optimization problem. Consequently, these panels are not often encountered outside of the lab or specialty applications. Also, understand that a panel is rated under standard test conditions. This includes a specific solar spectrum, straight on solar, and a temperature of 25¬∞C. Deviate from these conditions and the output of the panel will change. For example, panels are often fixed mounted to maximize energy delivery in the summer months. They will provide less power in the winter when the position of the sun of off axis. Likewise, the panel will lose about 0.25% efficiency for every ¬∞C temperature increase. If we were to install our 20% efficient the panel in a 40¬∞C desert environment, the efficiency would be in the 16% range. For a full account of efficiency, we should also factor in environmental factors such as dust, end of life fade, efficiency of the power converters, efficiency of storage if present.  The word efficiency has so many different meanings when applied to solar. Let‚Äôs explore a few of them: The most important efficiency discussion we should have is the amount of good we achieve per dollar spent. I think you will agree, climate change is something we need to address. Also, I think you will agree that we need to be smart about how we spend our resources. Consider this a really large home improvement project. There is no way we can do everything at once, so we need to choose our projects carefully. You aren‚Äôt going to like my next statement‚Ä¶ We need to stop subsidizing rooftop solar immediately. By comparison to appropriately placed solar farms, rooftop lacks efficiency. It lacks the efficiency obtained through economy of scale in every metric: installation cost, maintenance cost, and electrical output due to panel orientation along with the lower efficiency of the solar to power grid interface. As far as home improvement project are concerned rooftop is a poor investment. To support this statement, you can see that rooftop solar is the most expensive generator in our inventory on a LCOE basis.    You could also follow Project Drawdown‚Äôs numbers as outlined in this post:  Aaron Dahlen's answer to What are the most amazing climate change adaptation technologies you know of?  One last comment about efficiency: Past performance does not guarantee future results. So many folks point to today‚Äôs solar and wind projects. They will tell you that solar and wind is low cost and easy to install. They will tell you that this is the future. It‚Äôs a seductive argument. It‚Äôs a message of hope and simplicity. It‚Äôs what people want to hear. Unfortunately, the entire premise is based on the continued availability of fossil fuel. You see, solar and wind are low cost because we can quickly switch to low cost reliable fossil fuel generators to make up the difference. The more we move to a emission free future the harder this becomes. Actually, it becomes very expensive. So expensive that I fear we will only delay our transition to the future. To explain why, may I present an explanation via a short story: Aaron Dahlen's answer to Is solar energy actually economically viable? along with a corresponding financial argument: Aaron Dahlen's answer to Will solar energy ever become cheap?

Solar Energy,"In solar energy, what is still left to invent or discover?"," This image may look boring but it tells an awesome story: There is in theory a 4x power conversion efficiency increase available for solar. That is a big deal since we don't need much efficiency increase to tip the scales from fossil fuel in solar's favor. Why is 4x efficiency evinced in this curve? The curve shows in laymen's terms a startling and little known fact:  Solar photons are correlated. Much like entanglement, or ""spooky action at a distance"", correlation says that two photons, while each appearing random independently, share a common underlying structure.  The above curve shows the degree of correlation dependency of different light frequencies at different distances. For example, red light photons (.9micron), at 60 microns distance  share 50% of their state. Quantum theory says we can build an antenna to tune to this quantum behavior much like a dish antenna tunes itself to the structure of the incoming signal. The math says we have 4x to gain back, but no one knows how yet! See  http://spie.org/newsroom/technical-articles-archive/4057-rectenna-harvesting-of-sunlight?ArticleID=x85345  for details. Cheers!",https://www.quora.com/In-solar-energy-what-is-still-left-to-invent-or-discover,"The current maximum solar cell efficiency is around 40%, so that is not going to quadruple.

Solar Energy,Can I think solar energy as Perpetual motion?,"The most inefficient is the Bhaskara Wheel. When you calculate the system with reference to the weights and the center of mass, you calculate that there is a balance point, but when you give the first movement to this system, you observe that it works non-stop. This is because you did not include centrifugal forces in your calculations. It continues its motion due to the vertical vector of the centrifugal force that occurs when every weight falling around its axis falls. If you want to design a more efficient system. Examine the wheel of Orrfyreus and you must understand and decipher it yourself, as its secret is lost with its inventor. For this, first examine the works of Veljko Milkovic and understand what he is trying to convey. If you care enough about this subject, you will understand that this can be done and despite the view that it is against the laws of thermodynamics, you will understand that the working of these systems is not against the laws of thermodynamics.  This is just a mockup. There are historical documents that say the truth works, and I know this secret. ",https://www.quora.com/Can-I-think-solar-energy-as-Perpetual-motion,"As for the real question, yes, a system consisting of a solar panel, suitable ultracapacitor, and an electric motor is exactly a perpetual motion machine. Its motion is permanent because if you used a solar panel large enough to run it continuously and make it run slower on rainy days it will likely continue to run for hundreds of years. A silly statement like ""it will stop eventually"" is superfluous. After a century, let your children do their best. Try to take advantage.",,,,
Solar Energy,Solar Energy:  Will solar power make thorium nuclear reactors irrelevant?,"Extremely unlikely.  The output of wind generators and solar panels is highly variable, thus the need for a 24/7/365 source of baseload power.
A friend of mine online lives off the grid, and has both a wind turbine and a solar array- but he lives in Canada near the Great Lakes (okay for wind, very bad for solar.)  During those periods when it is both cloudy and not windy, he has to fall back on a gasoline generator to charge his cabin's battery bank.  Since we don't have any technology yet that can provide ""battery"" backup for a large grid, we'll still need another source of energy.
Nuclear power plants emit zero CO2, and kill fewer people per unit of electricity generated than any other source of energy.

To be clear, there is no such thing as a ""Thorium nuclear reactor.""  Thorium-232 itself can't be used as nuclear fuel, but it can capture a neutron and become Uranium-233.  So you need to manufacture enough U-233 in an existing reactor to start the process.
The Shippingport Atomic Power Station (Shippingport, PA USA) was a conventional Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR.)  It operated successfully on U-233 from 1977 to 1982.
A Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) will run on anything fissionable, not just U-233 from Thorium.  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) ran the prototype MSR from 1965 to 1969, and it worked exactly as designed.  No expensive fuel rods needed, either- just dissolve the fuel in the FLiBe (Li2BeF4) salt mixture.  It can't melt down, because the fuel salts are already liquid at operating temperature.  It can't explode, because it doesn't use water as a coolant/heat transfer fluid.  The liquid salts (in a secondary fuel-free loop) do that job also- FLiBe even boil until 1,430 C/2,600 F.  And if anything goes wrong, a ""freeze plug"" melts, and all the fuel drains out of the reactor core into a ""dump tank.""  Since the dump tank is the wrong shape and has no moderator, no reaction can take place.  The fuel cools off, and freezes solid at room temperature.  This is a proven technology, not a pipe dream.",https://www.quora.com/Solar-Energy-Will-solar-power-make-thorium-nuclear-reactors-irrelevant,"Likely, molten salt thorium reactors will make solar irelevant - after solar reaches 15% it becomes extremely difficult to get 16,17,18, etc‚Ä¶..",,,,
Solar Energy,Is solar energy practical for Canada?,"Solar PV (photovoltaic) energy is practical in Canada. CSP (concentrated solar power, e.g. solar tower thermal power) would not make sense. The sunlight isn‚Äôt good enough for that - normally you would only consider it in the subtropics. The key measure of how useful solar PV energy will be is the global horizontal irradiance (or irradiation). Here is the  solar irradiance map for southern Canada , which is the most populated region.  On a different (lower) scale , here is the solar irradiance map for Europe.  Germany has made a success of solar PV (though the price was very high to start with), and almost everywhere in Germany gets less sunlight each year than Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottowa and Montreal. Thus  the cost of solar PV in southern Canada would be lower than future German solar PV prices, but not as cheap as those in Texas . The lower sunlight compared with Texas increases the area, number of solar panels and supporting frames needed per MW, but doesn‚Äôt change the cost of the AC side (inverters, grid connection).  This document  estimates a 2024 cost of 7.5 to 10 US cents per kWh (10‚Äì12.9 Canadian cents / kWh), but takes pessimistic values for future cost reductions compared to what has been achieved elsewhere. 2017 Texas prices were around 4.6 US cents / kWh (unsubsidised) and dropping. Canada‚Äôs grid is currently around 80% zero carbon electricity generation (59% hydro, 15% nuclear, 6% wind, with very little solar at present). 20% is still fossil fuelled (coal and gas). A significant increase in solar (and wind) generation would enable the proportion of fossil fuel to be reduced and eventually eliminated in Canada . The gaps in wind and solar will be smallest if Canadian wind and solar are negatively correlated in local regions. This would mean wind that is stronger at night and in winter, as solar is only available during the day and is stronger in summer. This would leave the smallest gaps and would require the smallest storage capacity. Canadian hydro can be used as a key storage resource to fill in gaps in grids which are predominantly powered by wind, solar (and with some nuclear component). There are two types of hydro - a) run of river, and b) despatchable. Run of river is ‚Äútake it right now or leave it‚Äù generation. Good for immediate generation, but not for storage. Despatchable hydro is behind dams, which act as the container for storage so that the generation is controllable. Total generation per year is limited by the quantity of water. The best scenario would be for Canada and the northern USA states, which are near enough, to install enough solar (and wind) that Canadian despatchable hydro only needs to generate when there is very little wind or sun, so the water stored can be used to fill the gaps in wind and solar generation for as wide a region as possible. It might be possible to increase the despatchable generation capacity in GW, but not the quantity of water available in GWh. Another possibility is upgrade of some hydro to pumped hydro storage, e.g. to pair up lakes which are close, which would increase the total GWh of hydro generation per year filling gaps in renewable generation. The orginal hydro capacity and water catchment area is preserved, but pumping water uphill when renewable energy is cheap provides the ability to operate the hydro generation for a higher proportion of the time. Not only can solar enable Canada to get to 100% zero-operational carbon generation, but it might be an essential component of allowing a nearby region of the northern USA to achieve zero-operational carbon generation too.",https://www.quora.com/Is-solar-energy-practical-for-Canada,,,,,
Solar Energy,How is the future of solar energy in India?,"Climate change  is one of the biggest challenges we face today and the Government of India acknowledges the size of the challenge. Moving towards Renewable Energy Sources (RES) such as solar energy is a very important step towards tackling it. We want India to lead in the fight against Climate change and promote the use of Renewable Energy. We want to protect the environment not because someone is telling us to do it but because it is an Article of Faith for every Indian. We want to be a part of this global effort as responsible global citizens, to bring down pollution and address this challenge of climate change.  Our aim The Government of India has chalked out a target of  100 GW of solar power plants by 2022. ( 40 GW would be from solar roof tops and the balance 60 GW would be from: off the ground, large and medium scale projects.) This is what we aim for the mix of Renewable Energy Sources to look like in 2022:  Solar parks are an important part of future plans. The first solar park in the country was established at Charanka solar park in Gujarat. This was closely followed by the Bhadla solar park in Rajasthan. The concept of solar parks has given an impetus for rapid development of solar power projects in the country. More than 34 solar parks in 21 States with an aggregate capacity of 20,000 MW have been approved.  Large size projects have a potential to bring down the cost of solar power. Therefore, UltraMega Solar power projects having capacity of 500 MW or above have been planned in India. Large chunks of land are available in some States for solar park development.  India is one of the best recipient of solar energy due to its location in the solar belt and has  vast solar potential  for power generation. What we have achieved We have seen the largest ever solar power capacity addition in India of over 5,000 MW in 2016-17. India has reached over  13,000 MW of Solar power capacity as of June 2017  i.e. more than 4 times increase since June 2014. We've surpassed within 6 months of 2017 (4765 MW), the entire solar capacity added in 2016 (4,313 MW).   International Solar Alliance ( International Solar Alliance ) India also jointly launched with France, The International Solar Alliance of  sunshine countries  (countries which come between Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn). The alliance's primary objective is work for efficient exploitation of solar energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.   India is moving towards a sustainable future in terms of energy. But it won‚Äôt be possible without the support of every citizen. One can make a difference at an individual level, from installing rooftop solar setups to switching off the lights when not in use. Anyone can now download the  ARUN (Atal Rooftop solar User Navigator) Mobile Application  to learn more about solar rooftop systems and their installation, and get assistance for the same. SPIN  (Solar Photovoltaic Installations)  is another online platform that is designed to monitor activities involved in Solar Rooftop Installations.

Fake News,Is fake news better than no news?,"There is no such thing as fake news. There is real news, straight from a reliable source, and there is propaganda. There is no in-between. There are a lot of people out there claiming to be journalists who have no training and no dedication to the ethics of the profession.

I covered a trial wherein people were suing a pharmaceutical company for physical ailments they believed were caused by the drug they were prescribed.

Fake News,"Do you think ""fake news"" is real?","You ask ‚ÄúDo you think‚Ä¶‚Äù this implies you are asking for an opinion, rather than a fact based answer. With that in mind, this is my opinion on the subject of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù. I do not believe traditional news outlets (major TV stations, newspapers, magazines. etc.) are any worse than they have ever been. I‚Äôm sure King George had writers to spin whatever it was the town crier was going to ‚ÄúHere Ye!‚Äù about. Being well informed has always required some work from the end recipient. Growing up, I knew some people who read up to five newspapers, cover to cover, daily. There are also those of us who get our state of the world from multiple sources now. I watch the news on TV, read some web sites, and for added color, I read a couple of Magazines each week. Diversity of source is every bit as important as having an open mind about current events. So what changed? It is exceedingly easy to put a website online. A lot of people get their news strictly from one source. If you have not heard of a mono-culture, you should read up on it. In a nutshell, if you take a healthy forest, cut down all the trees, even those you don‚Äôt want, then replace them with one species, you have created a mono-culture. Mono-cultures are bad for a lot of reasons, but the one that stands out in this case is a mono-culture has a much harder time resisting disease and rot. Think about what happens when one only gets their information about the rest of the world from a single source, or worse, multiple sources that are simply regurgitating the same writing. It‚Äôs not hard to imagine real information and ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù becoming blurred in that scenario. I first noticed a change when people I work with started referring to Fox News as Faux News. For me, this realization came in the late 90‚Äôs to early 2000‚Äôs. You see, I don‚Äôt believe any one source as gospel. I like to look at things from multiple angles, or multiple perspectives. Without a balance, how am I to take in new information? I don‚Äôt believe a human can deliver the news without putting some spin on the words they are conveying. I need different perspectives to be able to judge for myself. Otherwise, I‚Äôm relying on someone else to tell me what to think and how to feel. I‚Äôm giving someone else power over me. I‚Äôd rather be well informed and able to judge for myself. All that works well with traditional news media. Watch Fox News, but also watch CNN, NBC, and others. Or make up your own list of traditional sources. The main thing is compare and contrast the information you receive. The fly in the ointment now is there are so many outlets that purport to be truth, when they are spinning things, and they spin them so hard I can‚Äôt help but think they are doing so on purpose or they are willfully ignorant of what they are doing. Sort of like the bully that grabs your arm, slaps you with your own hand, and then says, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hit yourself.‚Äù while he does it again. Eventually, the bully and sometimes the victim start to believe what they are saying. On one hand, it‚Äôs easy to long for the days of Huntley/Brinkley. But we know they put spin on their stories too. As I said, I do not believe it‚Äôs possible for a human to relate current events without putting some of their own bias in that information. But when the distributor of information doesn‚Äôt even attempt to maintain a modicum of impartiality, it‚Äôs no longer news. The information they are relaying is an opinion. It may contain facts. Most opinions do, but it‚Äôs still an opinion. It can be very hard to distinguish between a news store and an opinion piece, especially if your own bias resonates with the distributor of that information. That is what makes having multiple sources so critical. You have to protect yourself from, yourself.",https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-fake-news-is-real,,,,,
Fake News,Is there ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in medicine?,"At the outset it's important to take stock of how the now ubiquitous term, ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is used as a cudgel towards two mutually antagonistic ends, One, a nefarious and insincere attempt to discredit ‚Äútruthful‚Äù news that is not to the accuser's liking. Two, the laudable public-spirited goal to reveal outright fabrications trying to pass themselves off as real news. Inherently cautious, science and medicine have evolved a highly elaborate publishing process with  formal peer review  as its foundational piece, which makes the nefarious usage of the term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù rare within them. However, recent years have seen a dramatic rise in outright fabrications, which fuels pseudoscience. Public understanding of science being weak to non-existent to begin with, such trends do no less than threaten to discredit genuine science, meaning the stakes are very high. To understand how pseudoscience in academic publishing today threatens the scientific edifice requires understanding how we got here. Mainstays Of Academic Publishing - Legacy Print Publishers & Their For-Profit Oligopolies Academic publishing has been a money-making racket for quite some decades. In a nutshell, in the  pre-digital  era, the racket ran something like this (also recommend reading the hair-raising  1 ), Around the world, governments and non-profits largely fund scientific research. Using these funds,  scientists  do all the work reported in their papers and give it to academic publishers  for free . Scientists even  peer review  each other's work  for free  - evaluating the data, assessing its scientific validity. Middle men facilitating scientific output,  academic publishers  select unpaid peer reviewers, manage the commissioning, reviewing and editing process using paid editorial staff, and finally publish the paper in one of their print journals. Scientists often pay  exorbitant page charges  or  submission fees  as authors for the privilege of getting their papers published in these academic journals, sign over to them the copyright to their published work, and they and their employers pay even more  exorbitant subscription fees  to access many of these journals. The academic publishers then sell back this published work to government-funded university libraries and other research institutions. Ultimately, who pays? Largely governments, i.e., taxpayers. Even as this preposterous model of socialized cost and privatized profit holds sway in academic publishing, the industry as a whole has also been consolidating with the result that a handful of large publishing houses now dominate the academic publishing landscape, each publishing thousands of journals across various scientific disciplines. In 2013,  Reed-Elsevier  accounted for ~24%,  Springer  for ~12%,  Wiley-Blackwell  for ~11%,  American Chemical Society , and  Taylor and Francis  for ~3% each of all the natural and medical science papers published that year ( 2 ). Digital Expands Rent-Seeking Opportunity Within Academic Publishing The clamor and push for  open-access , making academic papers accessible online to all for free, has placed a higher cost onto the shoulders of hapless scientists already caught in the maw of  publish or perish . The dreaded and highly dubious  APC ,  article processing charge , extracted for the privilege of making a scientist's paper immediately open-access online, means digital academic publishers can make bank lolling in their office chairs, their even more meager work verily a breeze compared to the already meager work legacy print publishers used to undertake in bringing an academic paper out in print. Meantime, legacy print academic publishers have also quickly caught onto the money making potential of APC, adding it to their already obscenely bloated profit margins ( 3 ). Just pay extra for APC and your paper is open-access online in just about any academic journal these days. Not exactly the nostrum that open-access advocates had been campaigning for. No wonder a detailed analysis suggested  academic publishing has better profit margins compared to even the likes of Amazon ,  Apple  and  Google  ( 1 )! All the money, no risk to life or limb, no law enforcement on one's back, leaving no pain, no gain for suckers, legacy academic publishing currently wallows in no pain, all gain, an ultimate in rent-seeking heaven. Digital Opens Up Academic Publishing To New Online-Only Players, Many Of Them Predatory Predatory open-access publishing - Wikipedia  - behold the rise and rise of  predatory  open-access digital academic publishers. Digital technology flattened the prevailing cosy (for academic publishers,  not  the scientists)  captive market  in academia, making it easier for newer players, many of them predatory, to glom onto the juicy pickings ripe for the taking, rocket boosting the racket to stratospheric levels. Digital, online-only publishing is after all far cheaper than legacy print. Increasing pressure to crack down against such publishers led the US FTC in 2016 to announce a lawsuit against the academic publisher OMICS Group, a lawsuit that's still working its way through the system ( 4 ). Updated April 6, 2019 : A US Federal Court in Nevada (where OMICS is legally incorporated) has ordered OMICS International to pay the FTC a fine of >$50 million for engaging in ‚Äúunfair and deceptive practices‚Äù,  Hyderabad-Based OMICS Fined $50 Million for 'Deceptive Practices' Pseudoscience  is the inevitable downside of the forced marriage between the albatross of the publish and perish imperative tied around scientists' necks and predatory online academic journals. A 2018 global investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported (below from  5 ,  emphasis  mine), ‚ÄúDozens of reporters from media outlets in Europe, Asia and the United States have analysed 175,000 scientific articles published by five of the world‚Äôs largest  pseudo-scientific platforms including India-based Omics Publishing Group and the Turkey-based World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology, or Waset . In addition to  failing to perform peer or editorial committee reviews of articles, the companies charge to publish articles, accept papers by employees of pharmaceutical and other companies as well as by climate-change skeptics promoting questionable theories ... Some of those publishers send targeted emails to scientists who are under pressure to publish as many articles as possible in order to obtain promotions and improve their curriculum , according to the findings by Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), WDR and S√ºddeutsche Zeitung. In addition to the German outlets, a group of more than a dozen media organizations including the New Yorker, Le Monde, the Indian Express and the Korean outlet Newstapa took part in the investigation. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists facilitated the collaboration. Although the existence of these internet-based pseudo-scientific journals is not new and has been warned against by universities and research institutions,  its recent rapid growth ‚Äî with the number of publications put out by the top publishers tripling since 2013 and involving some 400,000 scientists  ‚Äì set off alarms among former Nobel Prize winners. Those journals contribute to the production and dissemination of ‚Äúfake science‚Äù by failing to uphold basic standards of quality control , the report said. In Germany alone, more than 5,000 scientists ‚Äî including those supported by public funding ‚Äî have published their articles in such predatory journals, which have been increasing for the past five years.‚Äù Coda The scientific article as the be-all and end-all of a scientific career makes academic publishing a captive market. As  Stephen Buranyi  wrote in the Guardian in 2017, to control access to the scientific literature is to control science ( 1 ). That reality means predatory digital academic publishers stand to reap profits off of pseudoscience at the expense of science for the foreseeable future unless lawmakers seriously crack down against them.

Fake News,"Does Donald Trump spread ""fake news""?","No. Donald Trump exposes Fake News. Very few Presidents in history have had the courage to stand up to the media, but Trump is doing it for the people. True media wants to control the narrative for their own financial and political agendas. Trump has exposed their for-profit corrupt business model, and they are furious. The media is behaving like a petulant child. The media makes its money from advertising, and they have proved they says and do anything to get their ratings higher. They exaggerate everything so people will tune-in and watch. the problem is defining Fake News. The media claims they are not fake news because they do actually report facts and events, but this is only a small fraction of the time they are on the air. They take a small fact or event, then inject and intertwine their opinion and lies all through the small fact, until it is unrecognizable. Then they claim it‚Äôs not fake news because the one small fact or event is true. Separate the fact from the fiction, and the shows would be over in a minute. They need to stretch the show into an hour, or 24 hours, and the filler is the Fake News. Thank you President Trump for exposing these greedy talking heads who are doing so much damage to this country.",https://www.quora.com/Does-Donald-Trump-spread-fake-news,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What are the best crypto currency faucets?,"Faucets that I know that really make you earn something do not exist. Existing Faucets make you earn 1 cent per day or less (some even hundredths of cents) and in turn consume CPU, which over time deteriorates your PC. However, here I have written a list of 9 methods to earn free cryptocurrencies:  #1 Airdrops Airdrops are those processes in which companies that have their own cryptocurrency distribute a part of it to their community for free. But why do companies do it? They do it to create a database of targeted users and because through some actions like sharing on social networks, they can become viral or more known. Did you know that in the last six months you could earn about $ 2000 if you would have done the airdrops? BOMB distributed 100 of its tokens that at the maximum peak came to $ 1200 and Energi did the same with 100 NRG which at the maximum peak were worth $ 800. Or that  Blockchain.com  gave $ 125 million in Stellar Lumens simply to register at their site? Or that MimbleWimble was forking and will give coins of the new currency that will have a total supply limited to 20 million and not infinite as the main chain? Or that at the time with the BCASH, BSV, ETC forks people had given away thousands of dollars? Or that Ontology airdropped 1000 tokens at the time that came to a maximum peak of $ 10 dollars per tokens? #2 & 3 Bounty & Contest The contests and the Bounties are many times call to action for users to earn cryptocurrencies. What is it about? They are simple actions required by those who are creating the contest or the bounty to get a specific cryptocurrency in return. They range from performing actions on social media such as commenting on a specific post, rewriting a message on Twitter or sharing a post on Facebook to actions such as posting a precisely requested image, or guessing some specific questions, etc. THETA made the contest his strong point on the site Sliver.tv . Where to find the best contests? Attend all the communities on Blockchain and their related channels as much as possible. Most of the best bounty and contests can be found on the world's best cryptocurrency forum  BitcoinTalk . Many users launch daily contests on  Scorum , a sports-based social blogging platform similar to Steemit and the same happens on  Steemit  where you just need to search in the search bar the tag ‚Äúcontest‚Äù and you will find different ones every day. In my opinion, the best contest in progress is that of NASH, where they will be distributed over 200,000$ in value in NASH (NEX) and Bitcoin (BTC).   How does it work? It is a ticket competition. There will be a draw at the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020. You can earn more tickets. You must register on the official website ( my ref link ) or simply go to Nash.io and you will get a ticket for each person you will carry in and for any indirect referral, that is, each person your friends will bring in themselves. However, to avoid fraudulent attempts, NASH has set the rule that each person must have cryptocurrency in their wallet for at least $ 25 in counter value to be eligible. So if you want to participate in this competition make sure you deposit 25$ and your friends do the same. There is time until December 29, 2019. #4 Referral We all know how Referrals work. A system to invite friends to the platforms getting something back. In fact, many airdrops, bounties, and contests optionally require you to invite your friends to get larger portions of certain cryptocurrencies. In my opinion, this is a great way and should be used sparingly, because it brings various personal advantages to you and also to the people you invite. The best way to use referrals, in my opinion, is to do it with your own online community (posting on your social media) and offline (inviting and introducing friends and family). Absolutely avoid going into cryptocurrency groups and spamming your referral addresses because it will only cause you to be ignored (or at worst banned), it will create a bad reputation and the results will be null or almost. If you really want to use others' audiences for your referrals, do it by adding value. For example, in this answer there are various referrals of mine, the article, however, brings some value and can be well seen unlike a scenario where a person enters a random FB cryptocurrency group, does not write anything and when it does it puts its own referral. The best referral programs I'm using are  Coinbase  because it is the best exchange for beginners in the world with low commissions and a user-friendly interface. It allows you to earn 10 dollars for each referral that buys at least 100 dollars in cryptocurrencies and allows you to earn the same 10 dollars for your ref. Binance  because it is the number one exchange in the world, once your friends have cut their teeth in this world, redirecting them to Binance will earn you a % on the commission of their trading.  Change  is a new wallet with a very simple interface, your ref is only valid for mobile devices. Friends who will download Change and deposit only 10 euros for Bitcoins will receive another 10 euros in BTC (maybe those terms are changed lately).  Brave  is the best browser in circulation in my opinion, from 2 to 9 times faster than Chrome, with the same features and an integrated ADblocker. It allows you to earn BAT only by viewing the ADS, but for now, it is only available in a few countries. Quick, clean, functional and revolutionary. Your refs will allow you to earn $ 5 in BAT if they install Brave and use it for more than thirty days. #5 ADBlockers ADBlockers are extensions on the browser that block the advertisements of the websites visited. As said before, Brave has an integrated one, to which you can add  AirTime  to maximize the speed of page loading and to gain some  TUBE . #6 Presearch  Presearch  is my opening page for every browser on every device. I use it with various accounts and I earned almost 2000 PRE in a year. It is revolutionary, in practice it acts as a search engine using existing search engines. It‚Äôs a layer. It does so with a very simple graphical interface with the search bar and the search engine icons on which you want to search your query. It works as a filter and saves time while also allowing you to earn 0.25PRE per search up to a maximum of 8 PRE per day. In his ATH people earned $ 6.4 a day just doing research. Now the price has dropped but the adoption is increasing, in fact, they have exceeded one million users and have a total supply limited to 170 million. In the future, I will make a detailed post on the latest Presearch news, which I believe has a bright future ahead of it. For now, if you want to know more, visit their official website at  Presearch.org. #7 Steemit, Scorum & Similares I mentioned about Steemit and Scorum already in other answers. These are social blogging platforms where you earn both by writing and being voted and also by voting. #8 Drugwars Drugwars is a game on Steem. Playing steals you little time and in a short time, you can earn 1+ STEEM per day simply by sharing your battles. 30 STEEM + per month for two minutes. #9 Dlive & Sliver If you are a fan of videogames or video streaming, in general, these two projects on the blockchain are designed for you. On  Watch Games, Enter Giveaways, and Win Free Prizes on SLIVER.tv. , a THETA's product, you can earn TFUEL simply by sharing a part of your bandwidth while watching the streams. When you enter the site, you only need to watch the streaming with the TFUEL symbol. There are also giveaways that allow you to earn TFUEL and there is a shop with which to exchange your TFUELs for many technological goods. On Dlive watching the streaming and commenting, a bar on the screen will fill up to give you access to a treasure. Once opened, you will earn LINO, the currency of LINO blockchain and Dlive. After a certain amount of LINO earned, you can request conversion to fiat money. These are 9 methods I know of to earn free cryptocurrencies. If you know of any other method, please post it in the comments. If you liked the answer, please leave an upvote and a follow.

Solar Energy,When will solar energy be cheaper than oil?,"Oddly, the question is comparing apples to oranges. Oil is used (in energy terms) primarily for transportation, like cars. Solar energy is used primarily form stationary objects, like houses. The competion for solar energy in houses isn‚Äôt oil, but coal and natural gas. The breakeven point on that ranges from ‚Äúright now‚Äù to ‚Äúa decade or more‚Äù. ‚ÄúRight now‚Äù is pretty rare, and only for very sunny places, and only when the volatile fossil fuel markets are on the high side. Subsidies can make it cost effective despite that, and those subsidies are funding economies of scale that are bringing the price down. A carbon tax or other way of dealing with the external effects of burning coal and gas would shift the point more quickly. The competition for oil in cars is‚Ä¶ well, there really isn‚Äôt one. Electric cars are in their infancy, though they will increase dramatically. They are powered largely by gas and coal, from the same power grid that drives your house. Electric cars are dramatically cheaper per mile than gasoline cars, in fuel costs. The overhead cost of the car is much higher, and there are so many variables that it‚Äôs hard to work out an exact comparison. The net effect varies from ‚Äúabout the same‚Äù to ‚Äúgas is still considerably cheaper‚Äù. Those same variables make it hard to predict when that will hit real parity, but I‚Äôd say that things will be very different, if not equal, in about a decade.",https://www.quora.com/When-will-solar-energy-be-cheaper-than-oil,Yes. It's already amazing how fast the house market for energy has changed in the last few years. I'm sure I heard that for the first time last year as much energy was produced by renewables as was produced by coal! Which is staggering. Okay I have to just go off and verify that fact‚Ä¶.,,,,
Solar Energy,Why is solar energy a good investment?,"Solar panels cost money, both for the parts and the installation. However, solar energy offers several remarkable benefits: Solar saves you money on energy bills:  You use energy from the sun. The cost of solar energy is less than the cost of electricity produced in other ways. As energy costs go up at your utility company, the amount of your solar savings increases. Some customers can dramatically reduce or virtually eliminate their energy costs with solar. Solar incentives:  MNRE offers various incentives for installing a solar solution. If you have a business or run a business from home, you may be able to claim your solar energy system as a tax deduction, just as you claim any equipment. Solar improves home value:  Buyers like to see solar energy because it means they can worry less about electrical costs. Home appraisers often value a solar energy system at or above the cost of parts and installation. Best of all, it will not depreciate the way the remodel of a room will. Your residential solar energy system will improve your home‚Äôs value for years to come. Earn back your investment:  Many customers find they can earn back the money they have invested in their solar system in just a few years. Solar systems offer lots of options:  You can go off-grid or stay on the grid by selling back excess power. You can install solar panels on your roof, or you can have a ground-mounted system. You can even use solar as a backup source of power. Solar is a renewable energy source:  You never have to worry about rising fossil fuel prices or the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels. Solar systems can provide energy even when traditional power systems fail. An off-grid system basically eliminates your dependence on the power grid. No matter what happens to the grid, you will still have your own source of energy. You start saving right away. You can see the results of switching to solar immediately, so you don‚Äôt have to wait to start enjoying the benefits. If you are planning to go solar, ZunRoof is here to assist you in every way. Please visit  zunroof.com  for installing solar panels on your rooftop. Also, please check out  zunsolar.com  for amazing solar products.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-solar-energy-a-good-investment,,,,,
Solar Energy,Can solar energy replace fossil fuels?,"Can solar energy replace fossil fuels? Solar can replace a large percentage of our fossil demand. Solar can provide nearly all grid electricity with a day of storage in batteries and pumped hydro. That‚Äôs a third of our fossil use the all of the worst fossil:coal. We can use the solar grid to power electric vehicles to replace oil use 90% or so. We can use solar electricity to replace heating and cooling demand. After all that, only about 10% of fossils demand cannot directly be satisfied with solar alone. It would save millions of lives and trillions of dollars per year. The remaining fossil demand can be replaced with fossil like hydrocarbons from recycling our wastes. More than enough. That includes chemicals, plastics, charcoal for steel and aluminum. Ammonia for fertilizer and such is made electrically anyway. There is no fossil hydrocarbons we cannot get from recycling our wastes. None. The cost is competitive particularity if the 5 trillion dollars per year fossils subsidies were replaced and recycling got all the dump tipping fees by law. It makes sense to also develop wind. They are complimentary and reduces system costs when used together. Grid scale batteries alone are already profitable. Adding big batteries to a solar and wind project increases the profit far more than the cost. Intermittent solar and wind cannot bid in the most profitable ‚ÄúFirm‚Äù electricity market. Adding just a couple hours of storage allows them to bid in the hour ahead Firm market and make more money per unit energy. Brian Donovan's answer to Can solar power become a major power source in the coming 20 years? If so, why? If not, what are your ideas?",https://www.quora.com/Can-solar-energy-replace-fossil-fuels,"I certainly agree with most of your statements and specially the one that solar and wind powers can be used to pump water from low level to high level reservoirs so that when none of the solar or wind energies are working the hydraulic power can provide the needed electric power with the high level of water accumulated on the reservoirs. Sorry for the missing part of your statements, where you forgot the geothermal energy that is a 100% reliable, safe, and almost unlimited and can be used as base electric energy leaving solar and wind just for the peaks. There is also another one that you forgot to refer which is sea waves energy which can also be used as base energy like the geothermal and hydraulic. One more item that you forgot : ethanol, methanol, and hydrogen will be the future fuels for vehicles specially hydrogen that can even be used in the airplane turbines.",,,,
Solar Energy,"Why doesn't Pakistan use solar energy, considering the energy crises and everything?","There are many reasons for this. Having worked on this for a number of years in a capacity of almost making it my profession, here are some pertinent points (in no particular order):  Awareness  (for large scale projects). One would tend to think square-meter upon square meter of solar panels, for a large scale project. This is not true. For very large projects, in our part of the world, polished mirrors using concentrated heating of pipes to make steam and then electricity is the solution. PV Solar panels, despite being low in cost, are not the solution. That is how very large solar deployments are done.  Concentrated solar power to make steam is the solution and is much cheaper.
Here is how it looks like:
This is how a concentrated arrangement would look like pointing at a tower, it takes into account the sun's every shifting pattern throughout the day.
Polished mirrors on a solar tracker. That pipe in the middle is what gets heated.
Another view of the same.
Solar has three distinct disadvantages:  Its not 24/7 - when the sun is shining, you make hay! When it is not, you don't Its expensive, but then you have to take into consideration there is ZERO raw material
These two factors keep a lot of people at bay from investing in it. The third is even more important.  Price of land. Very Large Scale Solar installation requires acres and acres of land. This can push the project cost up considerably.
On other factors here are some:  Where land is cheap, the national grid is not available. Oil and Coal companies (believe it or not) have vested interests with politicians, government and the financial sector not to fund such projects. There is a very strong lobby. The payback period is longer (despite the fact that it has no raw material cost) Efficiency, you must take into account that it is an industry that has  when the sun is out  production only and that too will vary during the day as per the sun's angle and cloud cover, so you never really get 100% efficiency. Lack of knowledge about how to go about with large scale solar deployments Funding - it is hard to find funding for large scale solar projects Circular Debt - a huge turn-off for organizations who would like to fund, but see the issue of circular debt which has been looming since 2007 as a deterrent.  Whilst government promotes solar, the policy can still be improved to really jump start the industry. The import duties are still very high on the various other components of engineering for the project The loan money as that can be provided by the government has never been pushed through seriously for large scale projects.  Hydropower is a serious competitor for the bang for the buck, almost nothing beats hydropower.",https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Pakistan-use-solar-energy-considering-the-energy-crises-and-everything,"Interesting thoughts.  However, having built both, CSP is simply more expensive than PV on a levelized cost of energy basis.  The only advantage to thermal is the ability to store energy for later use.",Quaid-i-azam solar energy park is expected to become operational in Nov this year with a capacity of 100 mw. but agreed more has to be done.,"What you are saying is the reality. Why dont we utilize solar energy on a small scale which indirectly cut the consumption of other fuel.
The best example is water heater. Why to burn our precious resource (gas) just to heat the water for domestic use rather we can promote solar heating and solar resource isnt an issue. And they can be locally produced as well.
As far as PV is concerned its expensive with low efficiency.","I think Pakistan has a good water base, and so does it have a great potential for Natural Gas. So it does not need solar power as much. But yes, I think the government should push for Solar Systems for homes. That ways a lot of electricty crisis problems can be resolved. As in India, we have programs that are lighting up Villages with solar-wind hybrids. These are the regions where National grids have failed to reach!

Great Answer!",Your answers are so thorough. Really commendable
Solar Energy,Is solar a better energy source than nuclear?,"Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Solar generation of panels falls off over years and the panels may well need replacing every 25 years to maintain useful output. They use a lot of land but can be set up at scale in a year. Note that ‚Äúat scale‚Äù means for customers who need much more power than they have roof. Solar on rooftops helps quite a lot. They aren‚Äôt useful for the half of the day that is night - yet. Improvements in batteries can help. They are relatively cheap. We haven‚Äôt worked through the full cycle to be able to recycle the used panels, only starting to be a problem now. Concentrated solar may be better for this. Nuclear has existing plants which were designed with massive steel forgings for pressure vessels and even more massive containment systems and concrete (which is a CO2 emissions problem in its own right). The plants were designed that way to give us nuclear material for weapons manufacture. The existing plants are expensive. The existing plants create very long lived waste. They run 24/7, don‚Äôt use a lot of land but take a decade to build one. So Nuclear has a bad reputation on a couple of counts.  Both are opposed by the fossil fuel industry. Both  are needed to replace it. We still get 80% of our power from oil, gas and coal. To replace that power we will require every  erg  of non-CO2 emitting power we can generate. Not all the power we can ‚Äúafford‚Äù to generate in the currently distorted economy‚Ä¶  all the non-CO2 power generation we can physically build. If we start that program  today  we might be able to cut emissions in half by 2030. If we don‚Äôt do that we don‚Äôt hold the 1.5 degree line and ‚Äú worse  things‚Äù happen. Bad  things are already going to happen, we guaranteed those when we ignored the last deadline.  Looking at the linked story the reporter tells only half the truth. The fact is that Germany is one of the worst places on earth to be trying to do this with solar and wind.  Notice that while they reduced nuclear quite a lot, with no real impact on their CO2 emissions from that massive effort, they continued to burn Lignite, the dirtiest possible energy source at very much the same rate. Their electricity is possibly the most expensive in Europe and they have made very little progress in their CO2 emissions for electricity in the years since closing the nuclear plants. France‚Äôs nuclear clean energy is over three times faster and cheaper than Germany‚Äôs solar and wind  I only compared current tech. The incentives to newer tech in the USA, are scant because of the artificial propping up of the fossil fuels industry through the government and the lack of anything like a reasonable social cost of carbon being applied to its products. The newer tech includes flow-batteries and other forms of storage systems for electricity and energy. Necessities for Solar to be able to handle more of the demand. The newer tech includes molten salt reactors that do not take massive pressure vessels and containment, that have fail-safe features and that can be far more cheaply mass produced. China is building those prototypes now,  not  the USA.  Meanwhile the fossil fuel industry is protecting its market in the US through its purchased political influence, its ‚Äúprotected free speech‚Äù as the clowns in the Supreme Court have ruled. Money is free? The USA is going to find reality staging an ‚Äúintervention‚Äù in the near future. It isn‚Äôt going to be pretty.",https://www.quora.com/Is-solar-a-better-energy-source-than-nuclear,"Solar generation of panels falls off over years and the panels may well need replacing every 25 years to maintain useful output. They use a lot of land but can be set up at scale in a year. But you need a roof  anyway , and they don‚Äôt even last  that  long. Meanwhile you always have enough rooftop-space for your solar needs, and salt-batteries are cheap. The key is to get the monthly cost of mortgaged home-solar systems, down to lower than the cost of electric-bills, when figuring roof-savings. This would be particularly feasible in temperate regions, where cooling is the main expense during the summer months when the days are longest.",The common panels are silicon and after 30 years they will still have 90% - thin flexible panels don‚Äôt last that long,"BJ, nice summary indeed. I would like to add a few things. The MSRs (Molten Salt Reactors) have the ability to process existing long-lived nuclear waste and extract much more energy out of that waste than it ever produced in the first place. The remaining waste needs to be stored for 300 years vs 10,000+ years. New technologies will be available in the future to further extract energy from that and reduce it to only ‚Äòwaste‚Äô. The building of new reactors can be performed with much less CO2 if you would use nuclear power to provide the energy to do so. Then again, a lot less concrete is needed for an MSR. It is unfortunate for the USA to have invented the MSR in the first place and the having to watch other nations progress in this field, having to import the technology in the future. I work in support offshore wind power. Even though it is a step in the right direction, I don‚Äôt see it as ‚Äòthe‚Äô solution for our worlds energy needs. The energy source simply isn‚Äôt dense and reliable enough. Even if you store energy, when you need to use the storage and it is nearly depleted, you will need to have a large overcapacity to begin with to replenish it. We need nuclear until we have a better alternative. What the fossil fuel industry probably fears is the fact that we can generate all the synthetic liquid clean-burning hydrocarbon fuel we need when we start using MSRs on a large scale from the CO2 in the air. The technology exists today, all we need is a clean, reliable, cheap and unlimited power source to do this as it is an energy-inefficient process.","Can U provide any evidence that it‚Äôs the ‚Äúfossil fuel Industry‚Äù & not people like the coal miners ? What i see is that it‚Äôs the renewable energy people that are misleading the public & getting all the money invested in RE so there is no money to manufacture the Molten Salt Reactors. Also, the cost to ‚Äúbuy-off‚Äù the NRC bureaucrats costs more & takes longer that it does to manufacture a MSR.",
Solar Energy,Is solar energy not as clean source of energy as it seems?,"RE:  Why solar energy is clean? It‚Äôs not. True, a solar panel sitting in the sunlight (or a windmill in a breeze) makes electricity without pollution or creating CO2. But solar power is diffuse energy (so is wind) which means you need a  LOT  of solar panels (or windmills) to make substantial amounts of power.  Pity the poor animals which used to live there. AND solar power is intermittent power (so are windmills) so you need redundant solar fields and batteries or pumped storage facilities to store that energy for when the weather does not cooperate. The diffuse nature of solar and wind power AND the low energy density of batteries means that you need  HUGE  amounts of materials which, in turn, means far greater amounts of mining, refining and manufacturing to make all that shi ‚Äî I mean ‚Äî stuff, and that ain‚Äôt clean by any means. China quells village solar pollution protests ‚Äî Reuters The people there must have been seriously threatened by the pollution of manufacturing solar panels to protest against a dictatorship. And speaking of pollution, those solar cells and windmill and batteries don‚Äôt last forever. What happens to the lead, cadmium, arsenic and other elemental toxins when dead solar panels, batteries, etc get dumped into your local land fill? (Or shipped off to a third world country?) Those toxins go straight into the groundwater and/or rivers. There is nothing clean about that at all. For more info see another answer of mine at  What don‚Äôt they tell you about renewable energy?  Also to get some real numbers regarding the amount of materials needed see  Roadmap to Nowhere . And to see the amount of land which would need to be used please read my answer  What's your view on the claim that ""Solar farms take 450 times more land than nuclear plants, and wind farms take 700 times more land than natural gas wells, to produce the same amount of energy.""?   That also extrapolates from recent, real life examples to estimate costs of large solar energy systems. And finally there is the cost in lives. Building and maintaining such a huge, mostly unregulated infrastructure will lead to industrial accidents, and it already is killing people, enough so that OSHA needs to warn people about it: Green Job Hazards ‚Äî Solar  and  Green Job Hazard ‚Äî Wind This single, ‚Äúrenewable energy‚Äù accident killed more people than Three Mile Island and Fukushima combined:  On the other hand, nuclear power produces no CO2. Its waste is fully contained. It uses far less materials and land. It is the safest form of power production. It can be put where you need it. And when you consider all the extra cost of turning intermittent power from ‚Äúrenewable energy‚Äù into reliable power then nuclear is FAR cheaper.

He also forgets that countries like Germany and France have run away from the nuclear energy and started investing in solar, wind, hydro etc energies which will supply soon enough energy for those countries. Finally even in USA the nuclear power activists and lobbies are finding difficulties to sell the nuclear power plants which are still using the old technology of nuclear fission full of risks to the population whereas the new technology of nuclear fusion is still being studied and tested without success and perhaps 30 more years are needed to get such energy under commercial and technical format.","You're right about nuclear, though.

Fake News,What is fake news about coronavirus that creates fear in people?,"I have been studying and researching this for a while now. The Coronavirus pandemic has brought out even more people spreading fake news than usual so it is a lot more obvious to more people. Here are some of the conclusions I have arrived at so far regarding the spreading of fake news about the Coronavirus pandemic. These are only a few of the reasons and there is more research to be done but here is an overview so far. There are people in the world who genuinely enjoy harming others. They get ‚Äòjuice‚Äô from the sadness, fear, pain, depression and anxiety of others. Some of these people create the fake news for fun. After they create the fake news they spread it for more fun and enjoyment. The more people they harm the happier they are. Many of these people do not create the fake news, they just spread it around. These people are called trolls and sociopaths. There are people in this world who are paid to create and to spread fake news. These people are also called trolls. They are paid by governments, corporations, politicians and other associated sociopaths. The Coronavirus pandemic is a perfect storm for them. The usual governments that are spreading political and social fake news are also spreading Coronavirus fake news to instill chaos in other countries. These paid trolls are all over the world. There are also trolls who spread fake news for ideological reasons. They are similar to the individuals noted above but are not paid. There are many people in the world who have very poor or no critical thinking skills for one reason or another. The will share misinformation for various reasons not realizing that it is false or harmful. There are a great many people who are very frightened of the spread of the Coronavirus and they reach out desperately for any glimmer of hope that they will be protected, cured, immune, or that the pandemic can be ended by some magic herb or technology. So they believe anything presented to them and then spread that information without even thinking about what they are doing. Because of their fears and anxiety they have very poor critical thinking skills and are unable to discern truth from lies. There are also people who are mentally ill who spread fake news and make up fake news because of their pathology. The best thing we can all do is to be discerning, educated, objective and use our critical thinking skills so that we do not fall for fake news about the Coronavirus or anything else. The trolls are not going away any time soon but if their fake news is ignored and reported and blocked they will have less impact. Be careful and be discerning.

Crypto Currency,How can my Crypto currency portfolio ever recover if it is down 90%?,"Consciously try to move from your grief to self-reflection and then acceptance. If you consciously knew you were gambling, it should be relatively easy for you to move on. If you thought you were investing into a solid paradigm changing technology, admit to yourself that you had no idea what you were doing and you bought into the hype without any understanding. Admit that you got scammed. Realize that entire crypto space (except for bitcoin) is one big scam of people issuing their private money. You didn‚Äôt see forest for the trees. It‚Äôs OK. It happens to us all. What does not happen to us all is that some people learn from mistakes and some keep feeling bitter at the world. I don‚Äôt know if you should keep holding your useless tokens or sell them and at least get 10% of your money back. I would say, most definitely do not throw more money into this to average down. I personally would hold bitcoin and as for the rest, I am pretty sure the crypto market will lose another 90% from the current levels (except for bitcoin which I expect to survive and even prosper, though it will get worse before it will get better). Like I said above, it‚Äôs just private money people are buying into. As a software engineer with almost 25 years of experience, I am of a strong opinion that the vast majority of the crypto projects are subtle scams. Some are outright scams. Those very few that are not scams (like Ethereum) do not make much sense from economic and technological perspective and are failing to compete with traditional centralized solutions. The entire point of blockchain is elemination of centralized governance and control to achieve sensorship resistance, unconfiscability, and game theoretical immutability of rules. Except for Bitcoin (which is also not as perfect in this respect as initially hoped and envisioned - just ok), there is not a single project that comes even close to having decentralized governance (despite decentralized infrastructure). This situation of having centralized governance and decentralized infrastructure is exactly what makes all these crypto projects non-competitive (and anyone who tells you otherwise is either ignorant or trying to scam you) - they all have all the drawbacks of centralized solutions due to the centralized governance and all the drawbacks of decentralized solutions due to the decentralized infrastructure (it's literally 1000s times more expensive to run your code on Ethereum than in Amazon cloud without any benefits that decentralized governance would bring to justify such a huge cost premium) As for Ethereum specifically, the world would be a better place without it. All it has achieved is enabling scammers to rob the unsuspecting public of their money. It‚Äôs an unscalable, Turing vulnerable platform for scams. That is its use case. I expect it to go to a single digit within a year or two and hopefully it will eventually disappear into the annals of history And as for Bitcoin, if you still care at all, read the best book on the subject: The Bitcoin Standard. I would not be surprised that if you put your remaining 10% into Bitcoin, you can very well recover your lost 90% if you hold for 5‚Äì10 years. I am not a prophet of course, but Bitcoin is the only thing in the entire crypto space that makes sense to me and I am quite optimistic about its long term future as a store of value mechanism.

Solar Energy,What are the latest techniques to harness solar energy?,"There're several methods used for harnessing solar energy. Out of them are : Solar panels, Solar thermal power, and CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) Solar panels are used to collect solar energy in the form of electricity. Solar panels work by allowing photons (particles of light) to push electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually consist of many, smaller units called photovoltaic cells. Each PV cell produces 0.5-0.6 volt. A panel comprised of 72 cells produces 36 volts. Solar thermal or solar water heating (SWH) is the direct transformation of sunlight into heat energy for water heating using solar thermal collectors. They use water only, or both water and a working fluid. They are heated directly or through mirrors. These collectors or mirrors collect  heat  from the sun and use it to  heat  up  water  which is stored in a  hot water  cylinder. In CSP or Concentrated Solar Power System, the sun's heat is collected through heat concentrating mirrors or reflectors and is focused on a tower where molten salt or other heating fluid are used to store heat. This heat can reach up to 1200¬∞C. Later water is heated to produce steam that used in steam turbines to generate electricity.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-techniques-to-harness-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,What are some mechanical engineering projects that utilize solar energy?,"Spraying of pesticides is an important task in agriculture for protecting the crops from insects. Farmers mainly use hand operated or fuel operated spray pump for this task. This conventional sprayer causes user fatigue due to excessive bulky and heavy construction. Fuel operated spray pump exhaust carbon dioxide as pollutant which has a detrimental effect on our environment. Hence, these conventional sprayers are not very efficient. This motivate you all to design and fabricate a model that utilizes solar energy for spraying pesticides. Solar Spray Mechanism  A  solar  powered agricultural pesticide  sprayer  is designed and fabricated. The system was ... studied to understand the  mechanism  for  spraying  process. The concoction is accomplished by the use of solar panel, a centrifugal pump which runs on dc supply is attached to the solar panel the solar panel generates the power that power is dc power its positive and negative charges are connected to a batter in order to save the power and use it when the sun raise are not present by using this device we can spray pest ices to the herbs and plants and any agriculture spraying it is economical as compared to the other means used like petrol/diesel pesticides sprayers. Advantages: The solar sprayer has many advantages. Besides reducing the cost of spraying, there is a saving on fuel/petrol. Also, the transportation cost for buying petrol is saved. The solar sprayer maintenance is simple. There is less vibration as compared to the petrol sprayer. The farmer can do the spraying operation by himself without engaging labour, thus increasing spraying efficiency.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-mechanical-engineering-projects-that-utilize-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,Doesn't solar energy production conflict with agriculture? Doesn't it take sunlight otherwise used in photosynthesis?,"This question has a couple assumptions built in within it.
 Location
As  Phil Jones (He / Him)  said, most of the best areas for solar are not suitable for agriculture, and vice versa.  A good resource is this site ( NREL: Dynamic Maps, GIS Data, and Analysis Tools ) from the National Renewable Energy Lab. The maps show that the best sites for DNI (direct normal irradiance) are typically not suitable for any agriculture.
Let's say a farm is selected for a large solar project.  What is the status of the access to electrical transmission lines?  Solar developers usually pick sites with transmission lines running through it as paying for easements and rights of ways for hundreds of miles of transmission lines plus other fees can make the project a non-starter.
 Money
Money is a consideration for both parties - landowner and developer.
On the  developer  side, is this site necessarily the best site? While not an example of solar, the basic issues are similar: Microsoft recently paid $6 million for a 100 acre parcel that is part of a farm ( Report: Microsoft Paid Six-Times the Price of Iowa Land for Data Center Expansion ).  The land was worth less than $10,000 an acre for agricultural use (due to poor soil quality) yet Microsoft paid $60K an acre.  Why?  A variety of reasons, all tied to money - tax incentives provided by Iowa that is worth more than $6M, overall project price being much less than you will find in other states, low labor costs, exemption from property taxes, etc.
Solar developers similarly will weigh money in the acquisition of a site - is this site closer to an interconnect point than others? Does the Power Purchase Agreement from the utility (for large scale projects) require the power come from a specific geographic area?
On the  landowner  side, the above example of the sale of farmland to Microsoft is a perfect example. There is no way that land could have sold for agricultural uses for $6M.  On an annual basis, what could the farmer really grow on this poor soil?  Not much.  So likely the farmer would have not used the field or switched to rancher mode and had cows grazing the land.
An example from a different landowner is where I work - the New Mexico State Land Office (NMSLO).  In 2011 the NMSLO was approached by a developer who wanted to do a project outside of Deming, NM.  They identified a 600 acre parcel that was being utilized for grazing.  This land was part of a very large (several thousand acres) grazing lease a rancher had with the NMSLO.  Grazing leases are typically $0.50 per acre  annually  for NMSLO land.  The NMSLO negotiated a 30 year lease of the 600 acres for the solar project (which was in the path of a 345 kV transmission line system going to El Paso) with the developer which will generate approximately $12M over 30 years.  The developer had been awarded a PPA from El Paso Electric and needed to begin construction in this area ASAP as they needed to begin production by 2014.  So we compared the solar project revenue with the grazing revenues ($0.50/acre x 600 acres x 30 years = $9,000).  Obviously the best choice was to pull these 600 acres out of a grazing lease (which did not impact the rancher as his lease was for tens of thousands of acres) and sign this deal.  The NMSLO, by the way, was created by Congress when New Mexico was granted statehood in 1912, and the revenues generated from leases on the 9 million acres of state land go to K-12 and higher educational institutions, hospitals, and a couple other entities. (see the list here  Trust Beneficiaries )  So that is my long-winded answer to your question. There are many considerations when siting solar projects, and thankfully there is more than enough land in the US to have all-of-the-above energy as well as agriculture coexisting.",https://www.quora.com/Doesnt-solar-energy-production-conflict-with-agriculture-Doesnt-it-take-sunlight-otherwise-used-in-photosynthesis,"great explanation, thanks!",,,,
Solar Energy,Solar Energy:  Which is the better way to track sun?,"The best way to track the sun is  not  to track it.
Or rather,  not needing  to track it. What the better way is, is a  static device for capturing concentrated solar energy . No moving parts, apart from a cooling liquid and associated pumps/valves, depending on how large and complex the installation is. This technology could be called SOLFED, but I am sure there will be several names, for what is eventually the same technology. Static Omni-directional Light Focusing Energy Device
There are some devices already that does this, but the focusing is not nearly sufficient to make an impact. I am sure I am not the only one working on a solution that will take this kind of technology to a stage where it can be used commercially. Why is this so important? Solar tracking doesn't work when it's overcast.
SOLFED technology does. Sure, the amount of energy you can harvest from the sun, with a clear blue sky, is much more than when it's overcast. In many parts of the world, the sun shines for many hours, almost every day. But how about those regions, where it doesn't? Tracking the sun is about maximising the influx of solar radiation, to increase the production from a certain amount of absorbers. However, on an overcast day, the light intensity can very well be between 5 to 25 % of full sunlight. In the case of too low light intensity, no amount of solar tracking capacity will do you any good. Capturing the light from various angles simultaneously, does the trick. The technology hasn't yet been developed, but when it does, it will be highly disruptive to the whole energy sector. Imagine being able to harvest solar energy - every single day, also on overcast days. Apart from not being able to track the sun on an overcast day, there are other disadvantages to solar tracking:  The more angles you want to cover, the more each panel will shade for the other panels (or distance between them have to be greater). This means wasting the area that should have been optimised. Static absorbers can be placed as close as you want, without shading each other. Tracking requires both a control system, as well as some kind of actuators or motors. It has a cost in both construction and maintenance, which will offset the increased yields) Weather extremes, especially storms, can damage solar tracking devices, whereas static absorbers can be constructed much more sturdy.

Fake News,What are the most-followed publishers of fake news on Facebook?,"Buckle in. We‚Äôre about to take a tour through the dregs of the internet. In my experience as an occasional fact-check ninja, there are seven Facebook pages that really set the bar in terms of high following + low ethics. #1:  Natural News  (2.1m followers) Perhaps the most troubling example of all. Their roots are in the anti-vaccine, anti-GMO type of alarmism ‚Äî but they‚Äôve since gone full tinfoil.  I could post dozens more examples, but I suspect the pop-up that greets you when visiting their website paints the rest of the picture with unsettling clarity:  #2:  American News  (4.8m followers) Their most recent post is pretty representative. Note the inherent hypocrisy of a Constitution-obsessed outlet posing the question of whether or not they should ‚Äúlet‚Äù an actual newsman exercise his First Amendment rights.  #3:  Conservative 101  (2.1m followers) To be clear, this isn‚Äôt about being a  biased  news outlet. It isn‚Äôt that they have a conservative slant that colors their commentary. It‚Äôs that they manufacture explicitly (often outrageously) untrue nonsense for the sake of bringing in clicks.  (To save you a click, the investigation has yet to backfire. No news to be had anywhere in the article. Just pure, unadulterated clickbait.) #4:  Right Wing News  (3.1m followers) It‚Äôs hard to tell most of these pages apart from headlines alone. Many of them share common ownership (or else syndicate content from shared sources). Even in cases where a page is a one-off operation, the template is pretty clear: go for maximum outrage and tribal sentiment.  Oh, and this particular page (like those that follow) actually has a blue check-mark. This means someone at Facebook gave them an official stamp of approval.  I want to believe that Facebook is better than this. But they have a long path ahead in terms of rehabilitating their image on this front. The plan they announced last year simply isn‚Äôt working. #5:  Freedom Daily  (2.4m followers) As a rule of thumb, fake news is easily identified by the presence of all-caps, urgent graphics, and general hyperbole.  Oh, have I mentioned yet that these aren‚Äôt particularly egregious examples? I restricted myself to posts from the past 24 hours. #6:  Addicting Info  (1.3m followers) One of the least discussed things about fake news is that most providers aren‚Äôt partisan about it. Many operations will have multiple pages, each geared to different political affiliations. It‚Äôs purely about revenue. While fake news is somewhat more prevalent on the right, that doesn‚Äôt mean that those on the left are immune from giving in to the same impulses. Some of these pages even try to directly juxtapose themselves against the other side, suggesting that they‚Äôre the cure for the same poison.  They also routinely rely on strawman framing that makes those agreeing with the headline seem smug in their obvious intellectual superiority:  The quote in full was ‚Äú when used appropriately , they‚Äôre not dangerous‚Äù. While not exactly a deep insight, neither is it a confession of a controversial position. So why frame it like it was? Well, the more accurate alternative ‚Äúpolitician always against gun control is still against gun control‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt draw as many clicks. (Some might argue that misleading headlines aren‚Äôt quite the same as fake news. In response, I‚Äôd note that most articles are shared on headlines alone. While that‚Äôs a concerning practice in itself, it makes editorial responsibility there paramount. Any conventional journalist would be fired for the above example.) #7:  The Other 98%  (5.2m followers) While more known for anti-right memes, pages like this and Occupy Democrats are hardly committed to honesty and fair reporting.  While, sure, American healthcare is a mess at present, spreading exaggerated and unsourced claims doesn‚Äôt help anything. (Those memes which make no factual claims are just as problematic, as they only serve to increase friction between friends of different political persuasions.) We can all do a lot better. PS - I purposely left out well-known nonsense mills like Infowars, Breitbart, Fox News, Daily Caller, Gateway Pundit, etc. We‚Äôre just scratching the surface here. Note:  All follower counts accurate as of October 5th, 2017.

Fake News,Does the 1st Amendment protect fake news?,"First off, there seems to be no agreement on what ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is, because some of the people who use this phrase most often are the biggest liars and most dis-connected from reality. If people were like Pinocchio, the noses in Washington DC would be so long that people would be bumping into noses all day long. It might be tempting then, to try these disagreements in a court of law, using the techniques of legal procedure, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, etc. But the precise meaning of the first amendment is not spelled out in the Constitution itself. If it were spelled out, it would constitute not a few words of principle (which is all that it is) but volumes of law. Instead, such volumes do exist ‚Äî but as casebooks. This is Constitutional law, and, like it or not, the first amendment means what the Supreme Court says it is. In American Constitutional law, certain principles have evolved, as to what the first amendment protects and what it doesn‚Äôt. The US is closer than other countries to being absolutist in first amendment, but it is not entirely absolutist, for as Oliver Wendell Holmes said, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a right to yell ‚ÄòFire‚Äô in a crowded theater.‚Äù So here are some of the exceptions: National security . You can be prosecuted for releasing classified information. Perjury . You have no right to lie under oath. Fraud . You can be prosecuted for making money from false information. But such cases must be a clear  factual  mis-statement, such as ‚ÄúKrazy Bread has 10 calories a slice‚Äù when it is actually 100 calories a slice. You cannot be prosecuted for a general slogan or matter of opinion, such as ‚ÄúKrazy Bread‚Ä¶ the best tasting bread in town!‚Äù Libel and slander . This is more difficult to prosecute in America than elsewhere, as wide latitude is given to people reporting on public figures. Actual malicious intent has to be proved, which is difficult. In the area of political speech, the principle in America is to give very wide latitude, because the general view is that with public officials and elections, it‚Äôs up to the people to judge for themselves who is lying and who isn‚Äôt. Courts are extremely reluctant to intervene in what they consider political matters, because that would generally be usurping the privilege and duty of the public itself. Consequently, if you have a president who lies his head off (and you can accuse each recent president of telling at least one lie) it is up to the public to weight these lies. if the courts had to weight them, then they‚Äôd be so busy prosecuting politicians for lying, they‚Äôd never have time to do anything else.",https://www.quora.com/Does-the-1st-Amendment-protect-fake-news,,,,,
Fake News,Who has more fake news than CNN?,"We get asked about CNN‚Äôs credibility a lot, and I can only assume it‚Äôs due to President Trump‚Äôs false assertion that CNN broadcasts ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù But President Trump is a politician, and since the beginning of our republic, politicians have been claiming the press (today called the media) treated them unfairly. Even Thomas Jefferson complained about it, although unlike this president, Mr. Jefferson understood the value of freedom of the press and defended it. So, if you are taking Mr. Trump seriously (which in matters of political rhetoric, you shouldn‚Äôt do), you therefore believe CNN is unreliable. But the only reason Mr. Trump makes that claim is that CNN refuses to report the news in an adoring and flattering manner, like he gets from commentators on Fox News. If we define ‚Äúfake news‚Äù as quotes that were never really said (Barack Obama never ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù that he‚Äôs a secret Muslim, for example) or events that never really occurred (while Dearborn Michigan has a large number of Muslim citizens, they never ‚Äúoverthrew‚Äù the elected government and imposed Sharia law), then CNN has nothing to worry about. CNN reports the news. CNN has some widely respected reporters, and they strive for accuracy. Do they make mistakes sometimes? Of course. But they correct those mistakes and often issue an apology if they got something wrong. That‚Äôs what a reputable network does. So, you may hear a commentator on CNN say something that‚Äôs opinion and not exactly true. But you generally won‚Äôt hear CNN intentionally lying. Of course, the way CNN covers certain issues may not make the president happy, but it‚Äôs not the job of a news network (or a newspaper) to make the people in power happy. It‚Äôs the job of journalists to report the news as fairly and accurately as possible. CNN does that more often than not, and it‚Äôs irresponsible of Mr. Trump to keep telling his base that CNN is ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù If it‚Äôs actual fake news that you are seeking, there are many conspiracy sites online, and they make up lots of stories just to get ‚Äúclicks.‚Äù Fact-checking sites like  Snopes.com  regularly debunk the misinformation on these sites; but feel free to look for yourself, if you want to see what fake news really is.",https://www.quora.com/Who-has-more-fake-news-than-CNN,"The undisputed master of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is the National Enquirer.

Solar Energy,Are wind and hydro energy actually solar energy?,"Sort-of Yes for both. Solar is commonly PV and SHW. But‚Ä¶ Sunshine causes evaporation and moisture changes the mass of air, heat changes the volume of air, and clouds and pressures together make winds, which can be used to generated work, be it electrical or motion, as in sailboats. Sunshine evaporated moisture loads up as clouds which blow around from high pressure areas into low pressure areas, situations change and those clouds start to give up their cargo of moisture, as rain, which can be used to generate work, be it electrical power, as in hydro-electric dams or motion, as in watermills. The key is sunshine, or solar energy. The term solar energy however tends to differentiate to either the photo-chemical effect of sunlight in the crystalline structure of a PV panel or cell, or the concentration in a solar hot water system. Some systems are designed to put 300+ degrees of heat into pressurised oil and I understand molten salt can be generated at well over 600 degree C, but those concentrators are very specialised.

Solar Energy,Is our emphasis on developing solar energy well reasoned?,"We are all solar powered, to the extent that without the sun there would be no food to eat or air to breathe. The big downside to solar energy as we collect it today is that we can only collect when the sun is shining, and we don't yet have the infrastructure needed to move that energy where it is needed or store it until it can be used. The only downsides to solar energy that I can think of are that solar panels as they are made today often rely on rare earth minerals, making them prohibitively expensive. That problem is being worked on right now because there are multiple fortunes to be made by whoever solves them. I suppose another potential downside to solar energy is the disruptive effect cheap solar energy has on the economy. Right now I pay my power company to bring me power, and some of the money I pay them goes to maintaining their plants and the systems they need to maintain in order to provide power to their customers. If I got all my energy from the solar panels on my roof, I'd have very little incentive to continue doing business with my power company. One person doing that doesn't affect their bottom line very much, but if 5 or 10% stop being customers, they're now facing a huge financial gap that they'll have to fill by leaning on existing customers. To be clear, I no more think this is a reason to be cautious about adopting cheap solar energy than I think that we should avoid adopting cars because it will cause horse unemployment.",https://www.quora.com/Is-our-emphasis-on-developing-solar-energy-well-reasoned,,,,,

Solar Energy,How do I start a solar energy business in Indonesia?,"To start with, I‚Äôd like to know for what purpose and which scale do you intend to start the business in the first place. On top of that, which kind of ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô are you referring to? If what you meant was to sell electricity directly to the end-users, then unfortunately it‚Äôs impossible. In order to sell power produced by solar panels, you first need to register as an applicant before being evaluated by PLN, as the power purchaser. Unlike in the past, the procurement process is now conducted through ‚Äòdirect selection‚Äô mechanism, and so you would need compete with many other applicants. Procurement process of all renewable plants, including solar power, should be carried out through an intricate, long, and complex procurement process. That being said, you need to liaise with PLN,as the sole provider of electricity. The electricity purchasing process itself is quite complex and require a complicated mechanism. As for solar plant producing power less than 10 MWp, the procurement can be carried out by PLN regional representatives, meanwhile as for solar plant producing power more than 10 MWp, the procurement process must be done by PLN‚Äôs headquarter office, DIVEBT to be precise. To make your move possible, you should first follow the pre-qualification process and you‚Äôll be informed whether or not your application passed the PQ process as necessitated and the list of selected providers will be issued consecutively. Remember that the Power Purchase Agreement for solar plants is not more than 25 years after COD, this will be helpful in preparing all your important calculations; IRR, BEP, etc. As far as I‚Äôm concerned the bidding process is based on regional quota, for instance, it has been finalized that in Sumatera island alone the total capacity for bidding process will not be more than 168 MWp, all of which distributed in 115 separate locations. Last but not least, you will have to employ people who are highly knowledgeable and experienced in this sector (especially in price negotiation) and also, be aware of our ‚Äòcapricious‚Äô regulations.

Solar Energy,Challenges which will be solved by solar energy?,"Really three things: It replaces fossil fuels such as coal and gas as a source of electricity - and that means MUCH less pollution and (especially) much less Carbon Dioxide being pumped into the atmosphere - which is a major cause of global warming. There is only just so much coal, oil and gas in the world - and when we‚Äôve used it all up - it‚Äôll take hundreds of millions of years for more of it to form. Sunlight, on the other hand will be available in plentiful supply from now until the sun blows up. The technology of burning fossil fuels has pretty much reached it‚Äôs limits - it‚Äôs not likely to get any cheaper.

Solar Energy,Is Solar energy 100% clean energy? Is there another alternative energy 100% clean?,"All accurately-classed renewables are already 'clean' energy, meaning to operate them causes no environmental harm of any kind.  The caveat to this is the source of embedded energy during their creation.  If they are built with dirty electricity or use materials mined via dirty processes or transported via dirty fueled vehicles, then those processes would cause an amount of environmental harm prior to the renewables even being used.  This harm could be in damaging the environment, polluting it, unwanted modifications of how it works or using up a resource. When people ask about 100% clean-ness, they are generally referring to the inclusion of all associated embedded processes however, as long as dirty energy exists somewhere near the entire chain of building to using to decommissioning, it cannot be classified as 100% clean.  Picture if it's advertised as clean and someone drives a car to tour it, they're using fossil fuels to drive.  And even the operation of some renewable systems like battery operated vehicles may use dirty electricity to recharge them. To attain fully 100% clean energy in the local context (not including the butterfly effects), all that is needed is to clean up the embedded processes.  For some of them like passive solar heating, no extra dirty processes need cleaning because their only embedded process was to design the windows, overhangs and/or thermal heat-retaining floor differently while using no different materials. For others like EV auto charging, the grid electricity is being cleaned as a separate task by others so only waiting is needed. For others yet, things like mining, refining ores, shipping, metalworking and installing would need to be cleaned.  These separate tasks are being cleaned (or at least planned to be) but it's generally believed they have little hope of accomplishing that. So to answer the question the most accurately, passive solar is the only one there yet and the first one to get its embedded processes cleaned will likely be Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) because all it uses is rather minimal amounts of steel, glass, aluminum and concrete for the large quantities of power it produces.  And because each of these can already be either electricity powered (by the previously built plant) or directly powered by concentrated sunlight (think solar foundry).",https://www.quora.com/Is-Solar-energy-100-clean-energy-Is-there-another-alternative-energy-100-clean,Under the best practical circumstances any heat engine will produce discarded heat which can do damage.

That‚Äôs the story, that‚Äôs the message and indeed, one answer on this question mentions this leaving the Quora reader with yet more proof that this man is an out of control thug, and in a family park of all places. What has been left out is Robinson got in an altercation with a man who had just molested his 8 year old daughter in the pool, one of a group of three men who were not with any other family. The result of leaving this part out results in fake news, the reality is a family man defending his children (and other people‚Äôs children) from what appears to be a bunch of perverts molesting children in the family pool. Sounds a little different put that way, huh? Similar happened not too long ago when Mike Stuchbery called the police because Robinson was banging on his door bright and early demanding to speak to him face to face. This leaves the reader in no doubt that Robinson was up to his thuggery again, nothing can mitigate that, eh? Except hours earlier Stuchbery had taken a course of action, livestreamed, that risked the lives of Robinson‚Äôs children and ex wife. The result of leaving out this pertinent information is fake news. Robinson is no angel, he‚Äôs a working class lad brought up to fight for himself and he‚Äôs not afraid to defend himself. I think even he is embarrassed about some of his earlier actions, but he has grown up a lot. There is no doubt in my mind however that he gets very special treatment from the UK media, British state and the police. He is persecuted.

Of course, anyone pointing out that Robinsons vocal condemnation of Islam is resulting in state and media persecution will be condemned as a ‚ÄúRobinson supporter‚Äù and therefore not even worthy of speaking to unless it is to attack them, which is insidious in itself as it seeks to stifle any discussion. I think we should all be concerned about that, though some are just so blinded by hate and loathing (ironic!) that they really don‚Äôt care, and usually their hate and loathing is fuelled by regular fake news about Robinson.

Until about four months later, when other news outlets actually did their jobs and reported the  entire  story:  It turns out that the school just gave diplomas to every student, no matter if they were even there for most of the year, then patted themselves on the back for their high graduation rate. I‚Äôve seen similar stories praising a school district‚Äôs reduction in student suspensions, leaving out the fact that the school literally changed the rules to make it virtually impossible to suspend a student. Similar fake news I‚Äôve noticed over the years include: Stories praising an increase in the number of people with health insurance, but failing to mention that Obamacare forced people to get health insurance or pay a fine, even if they didn‚Äôt want the insurance. Stories mentioning very young people who get very sick with COVID, but failing to point out that the young people had other underlying health conditions. Stories that call any shooting that happens at or near a school a ‚Äúschool shooting,‚Äù in an effort to make people think it‚Äôs like Colombine all over again, when it was really a drug deal gone bad or domestic dispute that spilled over into a school yard. Stories that call any shooting with more than three victims as ‚Äúmass shooting,‚Äù to make people think it‚Äôs like Las Vegas all over again, when really it was a gang-related drive by. Stories that fail to mention when people are shot while themselves in the process of committing a crime. Stories that use the term ‚Äúimmigrant,‚Äù when really they‚Äôre talking about ‚Äúillegal immigrants.‚Äù Very few people are opposed to legal immigration in the U.S. Stories about politicians voting against some bill that only mention the name of the bill, but not the fact that the bill was thousands of pages long and loaded with pork spending, and that‚Äôs what the politician was voting against. Stories about politicians voting against, or failing to support bills that do things that are already the law anyway, and the bill was just a political move by a certain political party. Stories that rely on opinion polls as ‚Äúnews.‚Äù Stories that blame COVID for things that are more likely the result of other things. (Chicago is struggling to find new cops amid a wave of retirements and low recruitment numbers, and you‚Äôre blaming COVID? Really? Are you sure it‚Äôs not something else that‚Äôs making the cops look for other jobs?) Stories that the news only considers stories because of the demographics of the people involved. If the demographics were changed, would it still be a story? If not, then it‚Äôs probably not a story anyway, except in the eyes of narrative-pushing news editors and reporters. Sob stories about people in very bad situations that fail to mention how the people put themselves in those situations. To be fair, for that last one, NPR usually does mention how those people got in those situations, but they bury it deep in the story, and don‚Äôt connect the dots for the listeners. The story about a person trying to find work that‚Äôs supposed to make people angry about unemployment benefits getting cut off loses its sympathetic appeal when they mention that the person is also a drug addict or has a felony record or isn‚Äôt in the country legally in the first place. This sort of half-truth reporting is exactly what so many other Americans have been seeing for a generation now, and exactly why outlets like Fox News are so popular. I know that they‚Äôre only telling me half truths as well, but I feel like they‚Äôre telling me the  other  half. Between right-wing media and mainstream media, you can usually get both halves of the story. It just takes some mental effort to stitch it all together.",https://www.quora.com/What-type-of-fake-news-are-you-most-tired-of-seeing,"‚ÄúSob stories about people in very bad situations‚Äù My little town is in the flood plain of the Missouri River. We usually get plenty of warning (not always) that the river will flood and we locals take precautions ahead of time. Even if you didn‚Äôt listen to the news you‚Äôd know a flood was coming by the activity in town. There was a couple who moved in a double wide mobile home in the flood prone area across the street from my home. When I saw what was going on I told them ‚Äú It floods here, you need to set your home up at least 3 feet higher.‚Äù I was ignored. That‚Äôs OK. I warned them. We then had a flood with all the usual pre-flood activity. Water got up to the bottom of their trailer. The kids were jumping off the deck and swimming in the flood water. Then the news media showed up. I saw them on TV that evening all crying and saying ‚Äú We didn‚Äôt know this was coming!‚Äù Even after that flood they still did nothing and the Great Flood of 1993 took them out. When a Missouri River flood gets inside a trailer The floor will rot out in short order.","I was listening to a story about an Asian hate crime. An older Chinese man was merely walking down the street and he got severely attacked by five teens. Two stories before, there was another Asian hate story. They really emphasized that the man doing the attacking was white. With the five kids, it happened in Ladera Heights. For those of you who don't know Southern California, it's a rather affluent black neighborhood. There would NOT be a group of teens of any other race in that area. I found out through another source that they were black. I already knew that though. The news story left their race out, so I knew automatically.","BBC is definitely guilty of it. Especially of the last point ‚Äî sob stories of people in bad situations without any mention of how those people ended up in those situations. There was a program I was watching where a young woman was interviewed. She said that she submitted hundreds of job applications and still didn't find a job. The narrator then just concluded that it's so hard for young people in general to find work. But I thought to myself back then: ‚ÄúWait a minute. Has anyone even bothered to check her CV? Maybe the reason why she's not getting jobs is because it's really bad? Or has anyone actually question the number of job applications she made? Maybe it was only five rather than hundreds. And maybe all of them were for positions that she was overqualified for.‚Äù Because at the time, I was also a young adult. And I had no trouble finding work.","Years ago, back in USSR (echoing the Beatles‚Ä¶) the way to figure out what is happening in the world was to sieve through a government newspaper, the leading one named ‚ÄúPravda‚Äù (‚ÄúTruth‚Äù), then listen to BBC and Voice of America broadcasts in Russian, and carefully mesh the two streams of informational propaganda to compile the realistic picture of the current events. I hoped that this skill won‚Äôt be needed in USA, but here I am, 30 years after immigrating from USSR, putting this skill to use in order to learn the whole facts.","Stories about ‚Äúfewer people in poverty‚Äù measured by how many are on the welfare rolls, where all they did was move the bar so fewer people qualify. (This is the flip side of higher high school graduation rates by lowering graduation bar). ANY story where moving one bar changes success is suspect these days. Stories that don't distinguish between legal immigrants, illegal immigrants and asylum seekers. Stories that talk about how many illegal immigrants are intercepted (coming in) without also stating what percentage are being deported. Stories that talk about illegal immigrants from Mexico while ignoring the 60,000 from Canada, and the thousands who came in through airports (we have more than one border, you know). Practically all science stories, especially ‚Äúmiracle cure for cancer‚Äù stories about what new compound killed cancer in a Petri dish before animal or human trials have even been planned (most stuff that kills cancer cells also kills your good cells at an even higher rate, successful chemotherapy merely kills cancer faster than it kills you). Stories about ‚Äúcutting‚Äù a program (the favorite is Social Security), when what they are doing is cutting the INCREASE. I'll stick the habit of talking about a bills total cost (instead of yearly) rather than discussions of percentage of the budget under this heading too. And the bit about politicians supporting bills that are already law just to make a political statement needs to be in bold (Raffensberger, I'm talking to you).

I'm not certain of the number of air conditioned buildings in Tunisia, but I always say that during the warmest part of the day when electricity is needed most, the Solar Panels just happen to be gathering the most power from the Sun and producing the most electricity. This alone is a win-win.  Energy from solar panels is just as viable and ""powerful"" as electricity from any other source.  It can pump water out of the ground, power factories, and solar powered desalinization plants, electric trains, and anything else that electricity can do. Many people argue for nuclear power, even though it is  not  safe from earthquakes, tsunamis, or other disasters, both natural and man made. And  unlike nuclear energy, you can  gradually  introduce solar panels to a region as funds become available, and if an area has no electrical wiring yet, not enough wind for turbines, and not enough money for gasoline to keep generators going, then solar panels are the best answer for those areas as well.",https://www.quora.com/Is-investing-in-solar-energy-in-the-Sahara-a-good-idea,,,,,
Solar Energy,How do I bring awareness for solar energy in our country?,"On an individual basis,you can create such an awareness by telling a layman about how we can utilize the energy from the sun,not everyone is a technical expert,so you need to keep your jargon plain and simple and tell them about how pollution is affecting the daily lives of the common people,the ways to curb it,the way a household in a village can be electrified off-grid,then about the government subsidies on purchase of Solar PV panels by Ministry of New and Renewable energy sources(MNRE),like for an instance 30% subsidy is being provided on installation of roof-top panels in residential as well as commerical facilities upto 100 KW under Jawaharlal Nehru Solar mission. It's all your presentation skills,how you educate the people around you. World bank Report on Electrification states that nearly 78% of the entire country is electrified and the remaining is to be done in order to achieve the target of 100% electrification.Providing grid infrastructure in the remotest parts of the country can be costly and not that feasible as such the only cost effective solution of providing electricity to the poorest of all is using roof-top solar panels,an off grid solution,plus solar panels are very easy to maintain. You need to emphasize that india cannot become a developed country unless there is a balance maintained between the supply and demand of the electricity.The so called Make in India initiative by Narendra Modi would become a big failure if there is no electricity to run the big energy intensive industries and hence the acceleration of the growth of industries in india would come to an standstill.You need power to fuel your economic growth with cheap and abundant electricity.Look at china,they are around 13 years ahead of us,its called as the ""13 year divide"",china was almost equivalent to india in almost every parameter until 1980 after which they achieved a double digit growth rate for nearly two decades,improved its infrastructure,cheap labour and abundant/surplus power made china a global manufacturing hub,however on the downside its people are struggling for cleaner air,rivers are highly toxicated,china is the biggest dump of e-waste and that's quite well known,so the need for renewable energy sources like Solar,wind etc is a must without compromising the economic development.Development has to be a sustainable one without harming the environment.When you release carbon dioxide and other gases polluting the environment,it becomes a responsibility of the corporates and the people to plant equivalent number of tree saplings to absorb the released carbon dioxide. FDI or foreign direct Investment and FII or Foreign Institutional Investors are critical to the country's economic growth rate and they need a good infrastructure including abundant power supply,good roads,logistics etc.for which it is essential that the government spends capital on expanding its core industries of which power and coal are absolutely essential. On an International scale,there's been a huge criticism regarding india's plan to further expand its coal fired power plants due to Green house gas emissions and global warming,you know the climate summit wants every country to cut down its GHG emissions in order to keep the temperature of the earth below 3 degrees celcious and for which India is going to bring about a balance of Renewable and Conventional sources of energy,to be precise a 40% of Renewable and 60% Conventional source by 2030 is india's INDC in the paris climate summit COP21 and cut the GHG emissions by 30% of the 2005 levels as per Kyoto Protocol.

Solar Energy,How might the US government kill solar energy?,"Actually they are doing a pretty good job of it right now. The massive subsidies for solar have proven to be very profitable for companies but, as has been seen in Germany, the subsidies do not reduce pollution, do not lower the cost of electricity and do not create a large number of jobs. As a result, Germany and other European countries are stopping their government subsidies and tax benefits. The result is that companies that had built their business model around the huge profits gained from those taxes are now no longer profitable and cannot stay in business. The US is about 10 to 12 years behind Germany in their experience and does not seem to be willing or able to learn from their lesson so it is quite possible that in the near future, when the general public gets tired of paying taxes for nothing gained except massive profits for the solar companies, they will demand that the government stop those payments (FITs, RECs, etc.) with the result that many solar (and wind) companies will go out of business. It will take some time for new companies with a new more efficient and viable business model to build up the industry again. A second killer is the rush to put solar on homes and gain the reverse metering. Power companies - both production and distribution - count on a large number of subscribers to cover the costs of not only the power but the maintenance of the related infrastructure. In New England, they sell power on the wholesale market for about 4.5 cents per KWhr. and they resell it to the consumer for about 7.5 cents per KWhr BUT they also add in an overhead cost that helps pay for the system maintenance - for a typical average cost of about 15 cents per KWhr to the end consumer. These are rates that are fixed by law on all utilities by the states. However most of the states in NE also mandate that the power companies buy renewable power (reverse metering) and pay for that power at between 15 and 30 cents per KWhr. The power company not only loses money when they buy at that rate but they are not getting ANY money for system maintenance despite the fact that they still have to wire up the solar houses, provide them power when they need it and maintain the lines. Studies so that when about 15% of the power companies‚Äô subscribers go solar, the power company cannot remain economically viable and will go out of business or will require massive subsidies from the government. Vermont‚Äôs governor recently announced his goal of making the entire state 50% powered by renewable energy by 2050. Long before that goal is reached, the power companies will go out of business and the state government will have to change their subsidies to them at very high costs to the taxpayers. The economics of renewable energy has not yet caught up with the technology and we are heading for a crash.",https://www.quora.com/How-might-the-US-government-kill-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,Which comes first: increased solar energy releases more CO2; or increased CO2 retains more solar energy?,"Q:  Which comes first: increased solar energy releases more CO2; or increased CO2 retains more solar energy? The earth radiates infrared radiation in a band of wavelengths starting at 4 microns (micrometers), peaking at around 10 microns, and tapering off to around 50 microns. This is the Earth's blackbody radiation curve. If the Earth were a perfect blackbody, all of that energy would be radiated into space. However, there are various gasses in the atmosphere that affects that. CO2 is one such gas. CO2 absorbs infrared radiation in three fairly narrow bands: 2.7 microns, 4.3 microns, and 15 microns. The radiation it absorbs is retained in the atmosphere. It does not retain solar radiation which is in the visual spectrum. It only affects outgoing infrared radiation. One of those absorption bands, 2.7 microns, has no effect as it is totally outside the Earth's radiation curve. The others are outside the peak radiation portion of the curve, and in any event, most of the wavelengths are completely unaffected by the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. In other words, CO2 has a very small effect on the Earth's outgoing infrared radiation. To the extent that CO2 absorbs radiation, however, increasing it the atmosphere will mean more radiation is absorbed. [edit]  I neglected to point out the absorption band around 15 microns is relatively wide, between 15~18 microns (or thereabouts). The others are more narrow.  [/edit] That absorption rate, however, is logarithmic. Meaning, that as CO2 levels go up, the amount of additional absorption declines. The basic rule is it requires a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere to produce 1 degree (Celsius) of warming. So, for example, it's been estimated that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere in 1850 was 280 parts per million (ppm). To raise the temperature of the Earth by 1C due to CO2, it would require 560 ppm. To raise it another degree requires 1,120 ppm, and to get 3 degrees requires 2,240 ppm. Each unit volume of CO2 absorbs less infrared radiation than the one the preceded it and more than the one that follows it. As as far as I know, and I could be wrong about this, increasing the temperature of the Earth does not, in itself, affect the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Perhaps indirectly, but I couldn't say for sure one way or the other. I believe all, or at least the vast majority, of the additional CO2 that is accumulating in the atmosphere comes from burning carbon-based fuels (gas, oil, and coal).",https://www.quora.com/Which-comes-first-increased-solar-energy-releases-more-CO2-or-increased-CO2-retains-more-solar-energy,You are forgetting the secondary effect of the higher temperature increasing the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere,,,,
Solar Energy,Could nuclear and solar energy replace fossil fuels?,"In theory, yes; but in practical terms, not in our, or our children‚Äôs lifetime. In a simplistic view all it would take is the money and attitude change from governments and their people to support the change and on a Watt for Watt replacement of fossil fuel plants for nuclear and within a few decades we could be off of fossil fuel. But that doesn‚Äôt really fully answer the question. Besides power generation there are a number of other areas that would need to be resolved. These areas primarily fall in the realm of transportation, Cars, trucking, shipping, trains and air travel. You could argue that cars can be made all electric, but current technologies do not economically work for trucking, shipping and flying. Even in cars the current maximum range tops out at 300 or so miles, with most EVs at 100 or less. This fact alone has kept most people from considering an EV. Ground transportation could be converted from fossil fuel with some sort of technological leap such as inductive power from the road and overhead lines for trains, but the infrastructure costs for these changes would take a government mandate more dramatic than Kennedy‚Äôs conquest of the moon landing. But let‚Äôs think positive. This leaves shipping and air travel. The navy has nuclear ships, so there may be options here. NuScale Power is developing a small modular reactor, not designed for ships, but we could foresee a future where something similar could be used for shipping. This of course would take some complicated treaty work, as many ports have restrictions on nuclear reactors entering their waters. This is currently not an issue for shipping as there are only a small number of vessels, primarily military, that are nuclear powered. This leaves air travel. I‚Äôll be honest here, I have no idea how to tackle this one. The military did experiment with a nuclear airplane engine, but if memory serves it never flew and only made a number of taxiway tests. With the potential of even one plane crash I can‚Äôt see nuclear as a viable option here. Maybe H2/O2 electric fuel cell, but this would take some creative and transformative technology for this. There is also one other factor that would need to be taken into account...COST. To accomplish this goal would not just take replacing every power plant with nuclear plants, but you would need to build extras. Yes solar could take up some of load, but solar reliable produces near rated power for only 25-30% of a day in warm sunny areas. Once you have this power in place, now consider the real cost of converting. Replacing every automobile, truck, Gas furnace, gas stove, gas water heater, commercial boiler, lawn mower, Jet Ski, fishing boat, farm equipment, bulldozer..... Yes nuclear energy, solar and wind could replace our dependence on fossil fuels, but the reality is it would take close to a century to completely convert our entire infrastructure to accomplish it once the governments of the world agreed to and financed the transition. With a little luck maybe we will see the start of such a change, even if it our grandchildren that see the benefits.",https://www.quora.com/Could-nuclear-and-solar-energy-replace-fossil-fuels,"Sorry, some of that is very wrong...

Crypto Currency,How does a de-centralized crypto currency exchange work?," To understand how it works, we need to know what a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange is, it is necessary to first know what a cryptocurrency exchange does. Within the digital currency market, a cryptocurrency exchange is a platform that enables the conversion of fiat money to cryptocurrency and vice-versa as well as the conversion of different cryptocurrency pairs. A decentralized cryptocurrency exchange is one in which the architecture of the platform has no central controlling server. As a result, no third-party escrow intermediary is required to hold the funds of the participants in the exchange transaction. As we know, a centralized exchange has four core functions: capital depositÔºåorder broadcastÔºåorder matching and the exchange of tokens. Therefore, in order to be a decentralized exchange, each of these core functions must be decentralized in the following ways: Traders‚Äô capital must remain in their wallets, and cannot be entrusted to a third party at any stage. Orders must broadcast directly from trader to trader over an inter-blockchain DHT network overlay. Traders‚Äô apps must compile an order book themselves instead of relying on a central order book service. Orders must be matched directly between traders. When one accepts another‚Äôs order, their apps communicate to set up the coin exchange process, and this is broadcast over the inter-chain network. The exchange of tokens must be achieved without the involvement of an intermediary. And many games also lauch ICO in their platform( CryptoGame ), like  CryptoDerby  based on blockchain technology with CGT.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-a-de-centralized-crypto-currency-exchange-work,,,,,

Instead of debating whether or not Trump should be violating norm A or B or C, it is simply, ‚ÄúFake News! He never said that!‚Äù Of course we learn a day or two later that he  did  violate that norm and that it is no big deal, and ‚Äî deflection! ‚Äî X or Y person did something unrelated that was even worse.

Fake News,Is fake news really a problem?,"Yes. I'm not sure what your political flavor is, but the fact is there is fake news out there. Much of it is from foreign nations with youth hoping to make some fast money. Other fake news is specifically targeted to interefere with American interests and our elections ‚Äî think Russia. What's a worse problem is that fake news wouldn't work even an iota if not for two things: The laziness and bias of the American public and the favorite phrase of the person in the Oval Office. If Americans would take two minutes to double check news stories, fake news wouldn't have any impact. However, we're lazy. We're also biased. When we come across a story that confirms our biases, however far fetched, we're more likely to believe it. Think Democrats controlling a pedophile ring or Hispanic children in cages. Then we have Trump who's catch phrase is ""fake news."" He's said himself that any news he doesn't like is ""fake news."" While all Americans can fall victim to false articles, most fake news stories are specifically targeted at conservatives. They're more likely to believe them, less likely to check them, more prone to bias confirmation. I don't say this as a disparagement toward conservatives ‚Äî I say it as a warning.

Fake News,Is the BJP IT cell spreading fake news?,"No we are not. A political party like BJP with best contemporary leaders, best spokespersons, best IT cell personnel don‚Äôt need the support of fake news. But yes even i noticed the chain of fake news devised to tarnish the image of BJP. Media hypes the lynching incidents in the country only when the victim is a Muslim or person from the minority communities. The same secular media goes quite on murder of a person who is a Hindu. The development agenda of BJP is the big reason to worry for the so-called seculars and pseudo liberals because it does not leave behind any alternative for them to re-capture their previous dominance in the society. The biggest exampleS of FAKE NEWS came out during demonetization when whole of the media waged an all out attack against the Government. Any unfortunate death that occurred in 500m radius of any bank was linked to demonetization. THIS IS WHAT I CALL A ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù. The legislative assembly elections in five states in 2016 was seen as a mid term referendum to demonetization by these pseudo seculars and leftists but they were humiliated here too by the results. The only option then left to them was ‚Äúblame the EVM‚Äù. THIS IS WHAT I CALL A ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù. The so-called intellectuals and students with an IQ below room temperature are beginning to judge the the achievements of the Government of India under Prime Minister Narendra Modi as if they‚Äôve got tonnes of experience of carrying out Governance. They fail to understand a simple reality that the Man who made people of India stand in queues for days and nights‚Ä¶ they came out and queued to vote for the same Man. I can see a lot of ‚Äúwhys‚Äù and ‚Äúhows‚Äù in the answers to this question and a person with a sub standard knowledge claiming that anyone who questions MODI and BJP Government is declared anti national. Well this is far from true rather if you question the opposition parties you will be certainly declared either a ‚ÄòBHAKT‚Äù or a ‚ÄúBJP AGENT‚Äù. The extent of spreading ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù has grown out to such an extent that whenever any person questions any of the opposition parties they are branded as stooges of BJP. Whether it be CBI, ED, IT or even the Indian Army. The Chief Minister OF Delhi went one step ahead and didn‚Äôt even spare THE ELECTION COMMISSION and labeled it as BJP AGENT. THIS IS WHAT I CALL A ‚ÄúFAKE NEWS‚Äù. Whenever a person of muslim community dies‚Ä¶ without amy investigation the media announces that he was killed by ‚Äúgaurakshaks‚Äù for carrying beef. This happened when a person called ‚ÄúJunaid‚Äù was killed in a train in Haryana.

Fake News,"Not all news can be or is ""fake news"", so why does Trump keep calling everything ""fake news""?","The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution explicitly prevents the government from abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press and the right to peaceably assemble. In fact, the Founding Fathers considered the press the fourth arm of the law, keeping in check the potential of a despotic government from usurping the United States. A free press makes the government accountable to the people and acts as a watch dog on government wrongdoings. In 1971, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black ruled, ‚ÄúThe press was to serve the governed, not the governors.‚Äù Knowing a free and vibrant press is essential to democracy, yet is still held responsible for telling the truth via slander, libel, fair use and copyright laws, President Trump has taken a dangerous and damning position by calling most every form of communique ‚Äúfake,‚Äù if it doesn‚Äôt depict him in a favorable bent. In mid-August of 2018 over 350 newspapers across America stood as one running headlines opposing Trump‚Äôs mantra that the mainstream press is the ‚Äúenemy of the people,‚Äù and that ‚Äúall‚Äù the stories thousands of journalists spend a fantastic amount of time researching and composing is simply and unequivocally ‚Äúfake‚Äù has insulted the majority of Americans, our allies around the world and scholars. The president‚Äôs squall against reporters and the U.S. Constitution‚Äôs freedom of press has disenfranchised our nation and has been a segue to country‚Äôs like Saudi Arabia to dismember an American permanent resident journalist Jamal Khashoggi, because of his opinion columns in a major U.S. newspaper. Trump‚Äôs hateful rhetoric was further revved up on 3 August, 2018, when his called the news media ‚Äúfake, fake disgusting news,‚Äù at a rally in Florida. He said the media should remain caged. He discredits the media in his tweets regularly. He manipulates the press with over 4,700 lies he‚Äôs told per the  New York Time ‚Äôs tally. He undermines the press by only allowing  Fox News  to report on certain issues. He says he is going to look deeply into our current libel laws to better suit the current state of government. He has put Google under investigation for not having enough conservative articles rise to the top. He has stigmatized NFL players who merely take a knee to voice their ‚Äúsilent‚Äù opinions that we as a people need to do better in race relations. In 1964, the Supreme Court ruled that,""Public discussion is a political duty and must be uninhibited, robust and wide-open and may well include vehement, caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."" Just as the 1971 case cited above, where the Supreme Court ruled the press is to serve the governed, not the government, so too it was ruled in the ‚ÄúPentagon Paper‚Äù trial that prior restraint was against U.S. Constitution and infringed on the First Amendment. Frankly, about 10 other rulings since 1930s have honored and ruled for the freedom of the press to responsibly pursue and print stories concerning the government and entities thereof, including private citizens as long as it‚Äôs not done with malicious intent, but rather to provide and disclose the truth of the matters at hand. So, why does Trump dishonor and wholly disembowel the U.S. Supreme Court rulings concerning the press by discrediting the news as fake? The answer lies in his inability to think beyond himself. Quite literally, those who have Cluster B personality disorders are not capable of being a conduit of the people, who represent a multitude of opinions, values and ideas. They {Trump} have limited mind-sets and are considered by the DSN as ‚Äúretards‚Äù or shallow, who think only in an unilateral fashion. Harsh this does sound, but dangerous is the person who whisks fervent and provincial characterizations about an entire industry and people who merely voice their opinions. The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump , a book that 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts compiled out of a duty to warn mantra, foretells the reason Trump calls the media fake. In essence, not only does he do it as a defense mechanism, but as a mode of control. A signature trait among narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths is they need utter control. The power of the media likely exceeds that of the executive, legislative and judicial branches. By keeping that power relevant, if you will, disempowers autocratic leaders. So, first and foremost, those with personality disorders, or those who seek dictatorships, have to have control of the media. If they cannot get control, they will undermine and destroy their voices, which is what Trump has be doing. Bullying does not jive with America values. A William Shakespeare quote says, ‚ÄúMe thinks you protest too much.‚Äù This has been translated into meaning, ‚Äúthe more you pronounce against something, the more than likely you are guilty of doing it yourself.‚Äù Take for example, when Trump called  Forbes Magazine  and lied about his net worth in order to get in their publication. Take for example, when Trump had Pecker‚Äôs tabloid write lies and slanderous cover stories about Clinton. Take for example, when Trump University took over $30K from students, who enrolled and didn‚Äôt fulfill ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù messaging or promises. Take for example, the 4,700 documented lies and misleading statements Trump told world press in order to look more favorable to everyone. Take for example, the affairs he‚Äôs had on all of his wives. Take for example, him chanting, ‚ÄúLock her up, lock her up.‚Äù It‚Äôs called projection. That‚Äôs why Trump calls the news fake. It‚Äôs also called NPD.",https://www.quora.com/Not-all-news-can-be-or-is-fake-news-so-why-does-Trump-keep-calling-everything-fake-news,"And it's also use of the Illusory Truth Effect.

Fake News,Is pseudoscience comparable to fake news?,"Is pseudoscience comparable to fake news? Absolutely NOT! Fake News Is generally an attempt to confuse people by publishing disinformation. It is a form of propaganda. It can also be news that is presented from an extremely biased viewpoint. This can lead to people distrusting the real facts of a story. It is also important to realize that anything can be called Fake News but keep in mind if those claiming something is Fake News know what they‚Äôre talking about. Propaganda Fake News is a type of propaganda, not the other way round. Propaganda isn‚Äôt always meant to deceive but propaganda is always meant to influence public opinion. Most Public Service Announcements are a form of good propaganda. In WWII the British had a lot of propaganda posters, some originals are very valuable today as ephemera sold on Ebay. They were valuable in WWII to keep up the civilian morale. The US also had many propaganda posters, as did the Nazis.  Pseudoscience Though the term has always been derogatory since coined in the 18th Century, it has taken on a more serious meaning since revisited by Karl R. Popper in the 20th Century as a demarcation between the edge of science and the area beyond. For a true consideration of the term and its meaning and its importance in the epistemic philosophy of science, check out the link below from Stanford University‚Äôs page on Karl R. Popper. Science and Pseudo-Science Science never attempts to prove anything. The idea of scientific verification is outdated. Science does not and cannot be verified. When one attempts to verify any particular hypothesis, they chance to corrupt their research with confirmation bias. Scientific Proof Is A Myth Confirmation bias is interpreting new evidence as confirmation of one‚Äôs existing theories or beliefs. That is why the scientific method takes observations, facts, and evidence to form testable and  falsifiable  hypotheses. It is the falsifiability of hypotheses that are the hallmark of science. The bottom line is that pseudoscience is based on hypotheses and theories that cannot be falsified, most of the time because they cannot be tested either. Some concepts that many people consider pseudoscience, like astrology, can, in fact, be tested and falsified, and is therefore not really pseudoscience but merely unscientific. There are many ideas that people think of as very scientific but are actually forms of pseudoscience. One major area that I will example is in the field of Cosmology, and the Lambda-CDM Theory, or as it is commonly known, the Big Bang Theory. The field of Cosmology deals with the creation of the universe and its evolution. It seems fairly obvious that there are not a lot of tests one can perform on galaxies, or even stars and planets. What Cosmologists do is base their hypotheses on the testable physics of Quantum Theory and General Relativity. They also rely heavily on mathematics. Mathematics is NOT science, and visa-versa. One major difference between the two is that mathematics looks for proofs of theories while as I pointed out before, science can only look to test and falsify. One significant part of the Lambda-CDM Theory (Big Bang) is the idea of inflation. Inflation is the concept that sometime after the Big Bang, the universe went from a very small microscopic size to unfathomably huge in a matter of seconds, exceeding the speed of light. The idea of inflation is both untestable and unfalsifiable and is therefore pseudoscience. Here is an article from  Scientific American  about the problems of inflation being pseudoscience. Is a Popular Theory of Cosmic Creation Pseudoscience? Some scientists debate the idea that all scientific theories need to be falsifiable. Here is another article from  Scientific American  that puts forth those ideas. Falsification and its discontents If you read that article you‚Äôll see that the heady subject of String Theory is also called into question. For a great answer from a fellow Quoran read the answer below. Steve Denton's answer to How is String Theory any different from ‚Äúgoddidit‚Äù creation myths, as neither have been verified through observation or experimentation? Conclusion It is important to understand the power of propaganda, both its good and useful employment as well as claims of Fake News, which might not actually be fake at all. Regarding pseudoscience, it has to do with a hypothesis or theory being falsifiable, it is NOT just bad science as many of these answers erroneously claim.

Fake News,"What is fake news? Do you have fake news for today, what is it?","First of all - Trump coined the phrase, ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù to define REAL, EVIDENCE-BASED, UNBIASED, ACTUAL NEWS - when Journalists insisted on holding his feet to the fire, and not letting him get away with LYING about things he‚Äôd done, or knew, or said.

Solar Energy,Can we use solar energy to run a ship?,"Hello Anonymous, Simple answer... ""Yes"".  Solar can run a ship...  I've personally looked into this for my own personal Yacht designs, that I will hopefully apply here very soon. Yacht's/ larger transport ships require energy & power for it's daily operations. Movement across the ocean is derived from it's diesel power plants (combustion engines) to turn their blades, but large pleasure cruise lines are switching over to electrically driven 'pods' -so the engines turn a large generator to provide the MegaWatt's (MW) needed.  (small portable inverter/generator designs are more efficient, these ships are simply larger versions) In addition, those engines drive alternators & pumps to circulate water, desalinate ocean water, pumps to flush sanitary systems...  these are predominantly based on electricity... SO ! my company has a design that takes Solar energy & 'rotates' a flywheel to drive an onboard generator, which can then be used to move the ship across the ocean, power pumps, create clean water, flush sanitation pipes, run microwaves/stoves/lights etc. So you see anonymous, it's very possible, and on it's way.  (besides, I hate the idea of paying 120,000 thousand dollars for diesel refueling!)",https://www.quora.com/Can-we-use-solar-energy-to-run-a-ship,"The above comment may be true for a boat and it may be true for minor secondary systems on a ship like pumps and lights but your question asked about a ""ship"".  To that question the answer is no.  A boat is generally regarded as a smaller vessel than a ship.  Most of us know the difference.  The simple math and physics of the energy needed to move a ship takes far more than can generated by solar panels, not to mention the obvious lack of power at night and cloudy days.  A ship uses 20,000 to 40,000 kilowatts of power per engine and most have at least two.  It would take about 1 million 80 watt panels for such a ship.  If each panel was 2x3 feet, it would cover 138 acres of surface.  BUT it is not clear if such a system would have the toque to move a fully loaded ship - not to mention the obvious lack of power at night and cloudy days.....so the answer is NO - solar power cannot power a ship.

Solar Energy,How much solar energy can be tapped in 1 sq. meter on a roof?,"At optimal orientation, the solar irradiance for several locations is:

* Northern Africa: up to 2700 kWh/m2/a (@18deg inclination) I will assume you are talking about harvesting this energy for electricity production with photovoltaic panels.  How much energy can be harvested from this depends on the (STC = ""standard"") efficiency of the modules, and of the performance ratio. For standard modules, the total AC energy per year and per square meter will be about 12%-14% of the solar irradiance.

Solar Energy,Solar Energy:  Which Photovoltaic technology will dominate in 10 years? Silicon cells or Thinfilm?,"This question is 2 years old, but just popped up for me despite no new comments or answers in awhile (Quora seems to be doing that intentionally?). However, it's interesting to address the question in the light of what has happened in the last 2 years 1. Silicon has further cemented its dominance - the market had tremendous resliency and growth in the past 2 years, fueled almost exclusively by Silicon. The cost/price drop of silicon has been impressive. CIGS has just about vanished from folks vernaculars, and most of the high profile efforts - Solyndra, Miasole, Nanosolar, HelioVolt, which people were still talking about 2 years ago, are literally gone. Done. Out of business. Still a couple of potential players floating about, but not an appreciable part of the market. 2. First Solar has exceeded expectations with it's CdTe platform. Although it still remains a minority contributor to the market, their efficiency and cost roadmap remains impressive, and they do still threaten silicon dominance. Unfortunately for CdTe as a platform, there is really only one credible supplier (First Solar), and they have a secret recipe. Unlike Silicon, which has been commoditized. So, no matter how well First Solar does, CdTe is unlikely to dominate the market with only one supplier. To answer this question today (as opposed to 2 years ago), Silicon definitely dominated the last 2 years, and I would argue the next 8 years are probably in the bag for Silicon.

Crypto Currency,Which other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin are expected to grow?,"Below, we‚Äôll examine some of the most important digital currencies other than bitcoin. First, though, a caveat: it is impossible for a list like this to be entirely comprehensive. One reason for this is the fact that there are more than 1,600 cryptocurrencies in existence as of this writing, and many of those tokens and coins enjoy immense popularity among a dedicated (if small, in some cases) community of backers and investors. Now that you can invest hugely on Power-Miner Startup Lab (www.power-miner.store) where you can get daily profit off your bitcoin investments for as long as 6 months through mining and daily trading, then life is getting better for Bitcoin investors now. Thanks to the world cryptocurrency leaders for bringing in other options of earning cryptocurrency Beyond that, the field of cryptocurrencies is always expanding, and the next great digital token may be released tomorrow, for all anyone in the crypto community knows. While bitcoin is widely seen as a pioneer in the world of cryptocurrencies, analysts adopt many approaches for evaluating tokens other than BTC. It‚Äôs common, for instance, for analysts to attribute a great deal of importance to the ranking of coins relative to one another in terms of market cap. We‚Äôve factored this into our consideration, but there are other reasons why a digital token may be included in the list as well. 1. Litecoin (LTC) Litecoin, launched in 2011, was among the initial cryptocurrencies following bitcoin and has often been referred to as ‚Äúsilver to bitcoin‚Äôs gold.‚Äù It was created by Charlie Lee, an MIT graduate, and former Google engineer. Litecoin is based on an open source global payment network that is not controlled by any central authority and uses ""scrypt"" as a proof of work, which can be decoded with the help of CPUs of consumer grade. Although Litecoin is like bitcoin in many ways, it has a faster block generation rate and hence offers a faster transaction confirmation. Other than developers, there are a growing number of merchants who accept Litecoin. As of February 9, 2019, Litecoin had a market cap of $2.63 billion and a per token value of $43.41. 2. Ethereum (ETH) Launched in 2015, Ethereum is a decentralized software platform that enables Smart Contracts   and Distributed Applications (DApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control or interference from a third party. The applications on ethereum are run on its platform-specific cryptographic token, ether. Ether is like a vehicle for moving around on the ethereum platform and is sought by mostly developers looking to develop and run applications inside ethereum, or now by investors looking to make purchases of other digital currencies using ether. During 2014, ethereum launched a pre-sale for ether which received an overwhelming response; this helped to usher in the age of the initial coin offering (ICO). According to ethereum, it can be used to ‚Äúcodify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.‚Äù Following the attack on the DAO in 2016, Ethereum was split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). As of February 9, 2019, Ethereum (ETH) had a market cap of $12.49 billion and a per token value of $118.71. 3. Zcash (ZEC) Zcash, a decentralized and open-source cryptocurrency launched in the latter part of 2016, looks promising. ‚ÄúIf bitcoin is like http for money, zcash is https,"" is one analogy zcash uses to define itself. Zcash offers privacy and selective transparency of transactions. Thus, like https, zcash claims to provide extra security or privacy where all transactions are recorded and published on a blockchain, but details such as the sender, recipient, and amount remain private. Zcash offers its users the choice of ‚Äúshielded‚Äù transactions, which allow for content to be encrypted using an advanced cryptographic technique or zero-knowledge proof construction called a zk-SNARK developed by its team. As of February 9, 2019, Zcash had a market cap of $291.25 million and a value per token of $49.84. 4. Dash (DASH) Dash (originally known as darkcoin) is a more secretive version of bitcoin. Dash offers more anonymity as it works on a decentralized master code network that makes transactions almost untraceable. Launched in January 2014, dash experienced an increasing fan following in a short span of time. This cryptocurrency was created and developed by Evan Duffield and can be mined using a CPU or GPU. In March 2015, ‚ÄòDarkcoin‚Äô was rebranded to dash, which stands for ‚Äúdigital cash‚Äù and operates under the ticker DASH. The rebranding didn't change the functionality of any of its technological features including DarkSend and InstantX. As of February 9, 2019, Dash had a market cap of $640.76 million and a per token value of $74.32. 5. Ripple (XRP) Ripple is a real-time global settlement network that offers instant, certain and low-cost international payments. Launched in 2012, ripple ‚Äúenables banks to settle cross-border payments in real time, with end-to-end transparency, and at lower costs.‚Äù Ripple‚Äôs consensus ledger (its method of confirmation) is unique in that it doesn‚Äôt require mining. In this way, ripple sets itself apart from Bitcoin and many other altcoins. Since Ripple‚Äôs structure doesn't require mining, it reduces the usage of computing power and minimizes network latency. Ripple believes that ‚Äúdistributing value is a powerful way to incentivize certain behaviors‚Äù and thus currently plans to distribute XRP primarily ‚Äúthrough business development deals, incentives to liquidity providers who offer tighter spreads for payments, and selling XRP to institutional buyers interested in investing in XRP.‚Äù So far, ripple has seen success with this model; it remains one of the most enticing digital currencies among traditional financial institutions looking for ways to revolutionize cross-border payments. As of February 9, 2019, ripple had a market cap of $12.69 billion and a per token value of $0.308. 6. Monero (XMR) Monero is a secure, private and untraceable currency. This open-source cryptocurrency was launched in April 2014 and soon spiked great interest among the cryptography community and enthusiasts. The development of this cryptocurrency is completely donation-based and community-driven. Monero has been launched with a strong focus on decentralization and scalability, and it enables complete privacy by using a special technique called ‚Äúring signatures.‚Äù With this technique, there appears a group of cryptographic signatures including at least one real participant, but since they all appear valid, the real one cannot be isolated. Because of exceptional security mechanisms like this, monero has developed something of an unsavory reputation; it has been linked to criminal operations around the world. Nonetheless, whether it is used for good or ill, there‚Äôs no denying that monero has introduced important technological advances to the cryptocurrency space. As of February 9, 2019, Monero had a market cap of $808.50 million and a per token value of $48.18.",https://www.quora.com/Which-other-cryptocurrencies-besides-Bitcoin-are-expected-to-grow,,,,,

This is very different from the Bitcoin Futures from CME and CBOE which are settled in cash. Those futures are basically side bets and whales who hold large amounts of Bitcoin and sway the market up or down and basically win every time. With Bakkt‚Äôs bitcoin futures, it will be much harder to manipulate the game. If you want to short bitcoin, you actually have to deposit it. This makes much harder for whales trying to manipulate the market to do so. Plus buyers are settling with BTC which means liquidity is going to improve and could become more scarce.

Solar Energy,Can the unlimited harvesting of solar energy endanger earth's ecosystem?,"Not really, no. It's true that the total amount of energy increases if solar energy is stored somehow- but this is exactly what plants do. If you think about it, that's been an ongoing process for hundreds of millions of years, and every bit of fossil-based energy you've ever spent in your life has involved cracking the energy stored (a long time ago) in the chemical bonds of the [coal, oil, natural gas] or even in the logs you burned in the fireplace or at the campfire.  All of that stuff goes directly back to stored solar energy, and it's been done at staggeringly massive scale. Think about how much plant matter exists in the entire world. all solar storage. Every bit of food you've ever eaten. The meat you've eaten? It's all concentrated plant-stuff, again solar energy. Think about all the snow in the mountains, every glacier, even every drop of water that ever fell as rain... or that ever ended up in an aquifer. It got there by virtue of solar heat, moisture, convection, wind- all solar powered phenomena. The electricity from that hydro dam? Solar.  What happens when the sun shines on a solar panel... is that some (not all) of the energy is converted into electricity.  The rest goes to making the panel warm, just like the rock or parking lot next to it.  Eventually, that heat is radiated back into the environment, and ultimately into space via the atmosphere. The amount of energy that becomes electricity in your typical solar installation is minuscule by comparison.  My own array (6.5kw in nameplate capacity on my roof) will on an average day deliver ~20kwh to the grid.  My home uses maybe 3-5kwh/day, but that's tiny compared to the sort of power involved in other aspects of our lives.  To move a car 50 miles, for comparison, will typically involve expending some 50-80kwh.  (yes, your beater car, with all of 140hp under the hood, will put out a steady hundred kilowatts for as long as you keep gas in the fuel line.) What this means is that solar energy capture and storage isn't something that will predictably cause problems.",https://www.quora.com/Can-the-unlimited-harvesting-of-solar-energy-endanger-earths-ecosystem,,,,,
Solar Energy,Why is electric solar energy storage so hard?,"It is not really typical for solar energy, but for  electricity  itself. And yes solar energy yields electrical power. Any electricity is best used while it is being generated. The output of a power plant or a nuclear plant is pretty constant, but the demand is not. That means that it is tricky to match demand and supply. The price of electricity often depends on the hour of day. There are also seasonal changes in demand. You could say that the demand has always been intermittent itself.This was a problem long before renewable energy became an issue. There are times when there is a lot of unused power available. There are already hydroelectric plants that are actually storing some of that energy by using it to pump water back up into the reservoir. (‚ÄúPumped hydro‚Äù) Renewable sources have introduced their own intermittency with a different pattern of time dependence and this complicates the issue. Pumped hydro might make a contribution in evening out the problem in timing, but only in places where that is available. Another solution, at least for relatively short periods of time might come from batteries. There is a lot of R&D going into that because the automotive folks are hot on its heels. Besides the intermittency problem, electricity has another drawback. When you store it in a battery, the energy density relatively low and the batteries are relatively heavy, compared to the amount of energy stored in a chemical fuel like gasoline. Again this problem is not unique to solar, but it does present a problem if you want e.g. to fly an airplane with solar energy, or nuclear for that matter, because that also yields electrical energy. Technology to store electricity to a fuel does exist, e.g. hydrogen but this is still a bit further away from widespread utilization than the battery story. There are plenty of other ideas to store energy for shorter or longer periods, by pressurizing empty gas fields or using flywheels etc. but none of it seems ready for large scale application as far as I can see.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-electric-solar-energy-storage-so-hard,,,,,
Solar Energy,How applicable is solar energy to daily use?,"If you mean solar energy itself, the earth would be a lifeless frozen rock without it. If you are referring to its other uses, the two most common are solar heating and solar-generated electricity. In the first, you mount on your roof (0r somewhere they will be exposed to direct sunlight for as much of the day as possible) what essentially amount to radiators operated backwards, to collect the solar energy falling on them, and transfer it to the water circulating inside the panels and into the home, where it supplements hot water used in the home, and reduces the other energy (gas, electricity) that would otherwise be required to heat it. In the latter, panels filled with an array of photo-electric devices often called solar cells, are mounted on the roof of the home, again in a location where they will be exposed to as much direct sunlight as possible. The photo-electric devices convert the sunlight to a direct-current (DC) voltage, which is fed into an electrical inverter which converts the DC to AC (alternating current) which is used to supplement the electrical power provided to the home by the utility. In a simple system the solar panels only supplement the electrical power used by the home during the day. By connecting a network of to the load side of the solar cells, the system can store the electrical energy generated during the day, and release it at night, again supplementing and thus reducing the cost of the utility-provided power.",https://www.quora.com/How-applicable-is-solar-energy-to-daily-use,,,,,
Fake News,How is fake news undermining democracy?,"Some good answers already. Mine is simple: Democracy thrives when voters are well informed, understand the facts, and have the ability to form rational and reasonable opinions as a result of understanding the facts. Fake news (or Faux News as I have referred to it for years,) provides the consumers with disinformation in an attempt to sway their vote toward the interest of the purveyors of the Faux News. And unfortunately it works well. Humans are tribal creatures. We gravitate toward racism as it gives us an easy way to identify ‚Äúus‚Äù and ‚Äúthem‚Äù. When our news sources feed that natural tendency by subtly feeding the consumer partial information, or information with a clear bias, then the consumers begin to form irrational opinions that are no longer based on actual facts. Pretty soon those who have been the Faux News for years come to believe in things like ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù as-if facts and opinions are the same thing. Because they see their hero‚Äôs telling them outrageous lies and they see others in their little tribe believing these outrageous lies and pretty soon they truly believe in these absurdities. And they vote. So we end up with madmen and idiots running things. And Democracy crumbles. Looking to determine which news sources are generally fake? Look at studies done to measure the level of good and accurate information that people have. Ask people questions about actual facts, and see how well informed they are. Studies have done this, and have repeatedly confirmed that some news sources inform people well and accurately, and some fill their consumers with Faux News.

However, they refer to two entirely different concepts. Each and every coin and tokens are considered as cryptocurrency, even though many of them are not distributed as traditional currency and were never meant to be. Cryptocurrency coins are digital money that is created using encryption which is equipped to store a value over time. Technically, cryptocurrency is a digital equivalent of conventional money. Coins come with similar attributes like money such as: they are fungible, acceptable, portable, durable and have limited supply. Coins are tied to public blockchain where anyone is allowed to participate. They can be sent, received, minted and traded. On the other hand, tokens are primarily digital assets which are distributed by the project which can be used as a payment method inside the project‚Äôs ecosystem. Tokens carry out similar functions like coins but with one main difference, that it also gives out the holder a solid right to take part in the network. It may perform the digital assets functions, represent a company through shares or provide access to project‚Äôs functions, etc. Tokens predominantly represent an utility or an asset, and hence security as well as utility tokens are distinguished. Looking back briefly, Coins are no more than a method of payment whereas tokens might have the power to represent a company‚Äôs share, provide product access or service access and perform several other functions also.

Crypto Currency,Is Warren Buffett wrong about Bitcoin?,"This is about to Buffett's investment philosophy. Not only does he not invest in btc, he doesn‚Äôt pour money on any non-productive investments. He‚Äôs investor, not speculator. In CBNC's interview with Buffett, he explained in details why he did not invest in btc. he believed that bitcoin i not an investment at all, it‚Äôs just a game for the latecomers to take over what others have moved on. Warren Buffett: Bitcoin Is An Asset That Creates Nothing | CNBC There are two types of assets: productive assets and non-productive assets. For example, a factory, a piece of land for planting crops are called productive assets, Something such as gold, jewelries, antique calligraphy and painting etc which does not produce anything in itself, are called non-productive assets. In fact, Buffeet did buy a farm a long time ago.  Once you run a plantation, you‚Äôll naturally pay attention how much food it produce every year.  The we can judge whether the farm is worth buying based on the price of the farm and annual output of it.  Investors must care about what the assets themselves produce to investors. This is the normal logic of investment. This logic, the way to price assets, has now become mainstream. The future cash flow discount model in the stock pricing model is the concrete algorithm of this idea. That is, an asset can continue to bring you cash flow or income in the future. According to the idea of discounting, we can set a price for the current price of the asset. Calculate the discounted price (value) based on how much output the asset can produce in the future. We compare the discounted price with the price in the circulation market. Compared with the discounted price (intrinsic value), the current price is bought when it is underestimated, and sold when it is overestimated. This investment method that uses price fluctuations around value is the original meaning of value investment (the abundance of value investment is much higher in reality). Speaking of which, it is natural to understand the basic concept of an investment:  payback period . The payback period is uncertain, because we do not know the specific output in the future each year, though it can be estimated. Is there any problem with the asset valuation model of discounted future cash flow? Yes, it has two major flaws. One is that It is impossible to value the future assets output with many uncertainties. Another is there‚Äôs absolutely nothing we can do about unproductive assets. Antique collectibles which have been there for hundreds of years will appreciate in value. But the paintings themselves will not produce more paintings. For such assets, this model is powerless. Encryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is a typical non-productive asset.  Therefore,  for investors there is only one way to profit from non-productive asset investment, which is to wait for the next person to appear and buy it at a higher price . Currency itself is an intermediary for the exchange of wealth and its role is to exchange things for things. The creation and maintenance of this medium is a costly and profitable business. The fiat currency we use now is the work of central bank issuance, legal protection and government who have been maintaining it. So currency is a medium that allows everyone to exchange products of production. Though it is not an output asset, it is definitely valuable.  Buffett's aversion to Bitcoin is that btc has not become an effective intermediary for transactions . Encryptocurrency is an interesting social experiment and the final result has not been revealed yet. Bitcoin is meaningless to Berkshire Hathaway. This is the fundamental reason why Buffett does not invest in Bitcoin.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Warren-Buffett-wrong-about-Bitcoin,,,,,

Already cost of solar panels is too high, so try to minimise the overall system by cutting down cost of wiring, inverters, and various other equipments . There are basically two types of home installtion you can do in case of solar: 1) on grid 2) off grid

Solar Energy,What are the limits to Solar energy as an electricity source?,"Solar energy is a burgeoning form of energy source in our current world where fears have been arising from the possible scarcity of fossil fuels leading to increase in country's expenditure on extracting/importing fossil fuels. Coal-fired power plants currently fuel 41% of global electricity which is the main source of carbon emission in the world  increasing the earth's temperature.Therefore, it seems solar energy is perfect and necessary energy source to replace the conventional fossil fuels like coal and petroleum fuels. So theoretically, from solar electricity we can run our cars, run our refrigerators and all the applications we can imagine. Solar is something that we urgently need. But we have a big problem here "" BATTERIES"". Until and unless, we can develop more efficient batteries or get rid of them, we can't justify the fundamental claim of solar energy to be sustainable. It is not sustainable if batteries come in conjunction with solar photo voltaic system as we have to dump those batteries in the future anyway.Where are we going to dump them? And if we don't use batteries, how can we use solar electricity in huge systems where solar electricity storage is absolutely necessary. So solar campaign is in catch 22 situation. Use of solar energy in small systems will not give any substantial results besides being interesting science projects.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-limits-to-Solar-energy-as-an-electricity-source,,,,,

Fake News,What is the difference between satire and fake news?,"What is the difference between satire and fake news?

In response, Bill Maher offered Donald Trump 5 million dollars if he could prove that his father wasn't an orange haired orangutan‚Ä¶ because Trump's hair color matched that of orangutans. (Donald Trump has since dyed his hair blonde.) Trump then sued Bill Maher for five million dollars, and to prove that his father wasn't an orange haired orangutan, Trump produced his birth certificate‚Ä¶(short form). Apparently, not being science minded, Donald Trump didn't realize that it's impossible for an orangutan and a human to have offspring‚Ä¶. When Hillary Clinton was running for President, she, and the people around her, were involved in a pedophilic sex ring that was kidnapping children and keeping them prisoner in the basements and tunnels of a pizza parlor in Washington. This was known as PizzaGate. Satire is humorous, and makes fun of something. Fake news is not true, and not factual. In the first story, Bill Maher knew all along that Donald Trump's father was not really an orangutan. Really! No joking! This was his attempt at Satire, and he was poking fun at Donald Trump. The second story is Fake News, and was thought up to convince uninformed non critical thinking people that Hillary Clinton is a pedophile, unfit to be President. A Crackdown on Satire?

Plantbased,Isn't it hypocritical to be a vegan yet watch the NFL and follow football in general?,Why is it hypocritical? If this is because animal products such as pig skin or leather are used in the NFL. Then I understand your confusion. While there are vegans that avoid watching sports which promote the exploitation of animals for entertainment purposes. There are also vegans who share a different view. As a vegan I see your point but I have learnt that veganism is more subjective than you would think. So if a vegan has any personal experiences or attachment to the NFL they may have a different opinion to those who have never had any personal attachments to the NFL. There has been a large increase in plant based eaters in 2017 but not everyone who eats vegan food is classed as a vegan. Many people eat vegan food but they regard themselves as plantbased or mostly plantbased / flexitarian . As a vegan is defined as someone that does not consume animals and avoids using products which contain animal by products. Yet everyone has a different vegan journey. Some people who identify as vegan may choose to wear their old leather jacket as they believe it would be more ethical to make use of it rather than to throw it away. Where other vegans may also choose to use up their old non cruelty free or non vegan products for sustainablility and ethical reasons.

Solar Energy,Why do some people not like solar energy?,"Hello Tumie, Suppose we have a nuclear reactor along with significant amounts of wind and solar generation. On many spring and fall days, we find ourselves with an oversupply problem. Which system do you curtail and why? If you distill all of the the arguments, this is the fundamental question that emerges. It comes down to nuclear and Variable Renewable Energy (VRE). These are the only  CO_2  free generators that we can build in large quantities. Economics and technological readiness make storage and battery technology a moot point. Almost universally, folks will say curtail the nuclear plant. And just like that, the nuclear energy option evaporates. The economics for nuclear fall apart. In the resulting solution, we see the true face of solar. It‚Äôs natural gas, as this is the only generation that can throttle down and make way for solar and wind. But why curtail the nuclear plant? Let it run at 100% capacity where it can do the most good for the most people for the lowest cost. In this scenario we can minimize the amount of time the natural gas plant is running: in the summer the solar provides peaking energy in the winter the peaking is done by wind. When the wind is absent, natural gas provide the peak energy It‚Äôs a simple change of mindset. Reject the moral superiority of VRE and we can quickly move toward a cleaner environment with significant  CO_2  and  CH_4  reduction. There is cause for celebration on the climate front. There is a record number of nuclear plants being built worldwide.    Personally, I look forward to the day when the Vogle Westinghouse AP1000 reactors come to life.

Fake News,What are the popular fake news websites?,"I contend that most sites that come across as ""fake news"" without the comedy, do so mainly because they simply do the comedy part so poorly.

Therein lies the problem: the aim of these sites is less about making a point by using humor as an argument, and more about angering the right group of people on the political spectrum.

Solar Energy,Which are the hottest solar energy startups in India?,"I nominate  RED Solar  as one of the hottest company, it  was  a startup, but now it  is a well  established PV Solar EPC company across India. I will tell you why it is a well established and hottest among the other companies in India. You have to consider following parameters to find out what decides a company is best in solar sector. Having 1.3 billion population( Still increasing monotonically),  India cannot afford much land for power generation. So, it is not fair to install PV solar for commercials and Industrial Clients. At the sametime we can‚Äôt go with existing coal and steam-Thermal power plants. As India having Rooftop solar potential of  124GW with 24,84,08,494  houses, even if we reach  1.3% then 30% of estimated energy can be harnessed. So, Hottest and Well established company is the one which is working effectively on  Rooftop PV Solar  than  Industrial- ground mounted projects. So, we have to decide based on  no. of houses   and rooftop systems  than GW capacity.(Which many MNCs doing, in way, it is nothing but an ineffective way of saving earth) Lets see What RED Solar has been doing since 2016 If I say they Installed 200Kw, you cannot imagine the project on Roof. But they made it for an engineering college without any wastage of land surrounded by that college, which is a beautiful greenery. They saved many trees and will plant crores of trees in next 25 years. Here is a snap of that beautiful project.  They have also done for residential rooftop systems. They not only installed Rooftop Solar systems, but also they have been providing solutions and created awareness among various communities and regions across India.   Not just awareness but also innovation and personalized projects. Here are the few projects from RED Solar, where they provided solution. A project in VCTPL, most effective way of utilising space. May be common in many places, they initiated in Vizag town.  And a project in Villa community, where it's beauty remains same.  Along with this, they have also provided solutions for  many households  for their  high power bills.  India's development depends only on common man‚Äôs involvement. We have already seen that in mobile communication and rapid internet usage. As they have been providing proper solutions by harnessing infinite energy from SUN, I nominated RED SOLAR as hottest Rooftop PV Solar company.

Solar Energy,How solar energy is sustainable?,"Solar energy farms (and domestic roof syrtems) currently rely on photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity. This is sustainable in that it uses an almost limitless energy source, during daylight hours.   What is less sustainable is the materials used to manufacture the PV panels. If silicon is the base element that is readily available as sand. Other elements may be more difficult to sustain. How long these panels remain viable is a question I cannot answer and whether they can be recycled or returned to the soil another question. Like most energy systems there is a trade off between cost and returns. What is the efficiency of the panels? Does this fall off in higher temperatures? Can this be offset in the design? Can we add greater output by means of an energy amplifier? This is currently being researched following the great success of the SAFIRE Electric Sun project.   Watch this space!!

Crypto Currency,What crypto currencies will you invest in if you have $6K ATM?,"‚Äú What crypto currencies will you invest in if you have $6K ATM?‚Äù I am not advising you to do the following, this is just for fun. This is what my thoughts are and what I am personally doing. You should do your own investment research. I have a different take than some of the other advice here based on what I am seeing today. Looking at the charts, Bitcoin just rose too high too fast. It‚Äôs about to fall back to reality. It dropped $300‚Ä¶ wait, $400‚Ä¶ now, $500 this morning already.  Goldman Sachs recently announced  that the bitcoin will drop to around $2,200. Based on a lot of the activity, I‚Äôm seeing some bullish activity starting across the space and Goldman‚Äôs announcement will spook everyone if they weren‚Äôt already. I suspect it will drop for a bit before it goes back up to new record heights in a couple weeks/months. I‚Äôd look into  district0x  (DNT) - as it‚Äôs about to skyrocket. Bittrex announced it will be on their exchange soon. Currently at around $0.14 per coin and has been fluctuating quite a bit on the smaller exchanges. I would put the full $6k on that, then selling after it multiplies ‚Äî this will increase your money much more than putting it in Bitcoin today. If the market continues showing signs of a downturn, I plan on liquidating my non long-term funds into  Tether  then putting them into Bitcoin once it corrects and stabilizes. I fully expect bitcoin to hit the highs that the others are talking about, but there will be a downturn in the middle and you can make money on alt coins while you are waiting for bitcoin to correct at a lower price. Full disclosure: I am currently holding district0x. If you don‚Äôt invest that is your call, watch it.

Crypto Currency,What are the four crypto currencies that I should buy and keep untouched for at least five years?,"You cannot predict five years out. It's too long in this space. What I can tell you is this: Bitcoin (BTC) ‚Äî the next block halving is in May of 2020. This will lead to a massive price increase towards December 2020 when the ( virtually ) last Bitcoin will be mined. Also big institutional money will start coming into Bitcoin this year and next (Baakt, ErisX, ETFs). Bitcoin is not going anywhere and will remain the number 1 digital asset for 2 years. However, by 4 years time everyone might sell their Bitcoin for something better, crashing the price forever. Or, it might stick around forever as a classic, the first ever, a store of value. Cardano (ADA) ‚Äî They are developing the biggest competitor to Ethereum. Cardano is based on deep scientific research and is being meticulously developed by a world class blockchain team. They should be fully launched in 2019, and it could probably take 2‚Äì3 years to gain massive adoption. Again, after that it's hard to predict what might happen. Ripple (XRP) ‚Äî Yes, they have aspects of their business that come off as centralized, no matter what Brad Garlinghouse says about that, BUT ‚Äî they may become the default blockchain company trusted by large banks. That should give them a pretty solid business for at least 2‚Äì3 years, and a way for billions of dollars worth of fiat all over the world to flow through XRP, doing wonders for its price. Elastos (ELA) ‚Äî This is a Chinese product that has 18 years of work, research, and code behind it. (1‚Äì2 years as a blockchain). They are building an entire OS that will run dApps on a new kind of Internet‚Ä¶. One where the people who buy stuff have ownership rights. So not only can the author of an eBook make money selling it, for example, but everyone who buys the eBook can also sell their copy to someone else, making the Elastos internet more like real life. Yes, if you buy 50,000 eBooks with Elastos, you can open your own eBook store and sell back the books you bought in the first place! Same for movies, music, etc. This project is HUGE, and it would take pages to write everything about it. Many people believe it's the top, best crypto project PERIOD, and will be the long term winner. However, they really need to create an English speaking marketing team. ‚Äî‚Äî In addition ‚Äî‚Äî Ethereum (ETH) ‚Äî if they can solve all their technical issues next year, they may retain their #1 spot in the smart contract / dApp space, but my money is on Cardano, which is undervalued at 8 cents. At $220 for Ethereum, it seems overvalued. IOTA, NANO, HOT (Holochain) ‚Äî These projects are working on infinitely scalable blockchain tech. They will probably stick around. AND FINALLY As Daniel Jeffries preaches, blockchain is merely an iteration of tech. Iterations disappear. Blockchain will disappear one day when something better comes along. What stays around forever are  categories  of tech. What category is the blockchain iteration under?  Distributed consensus . Blockchain is simply the first ever  iteration  of distributed consensus, deployed with Bitcoin in 2009, creating this new category of tech and a new type of money. What will the next iteration of distributed consensus be? It won't be blockchain. Perhaps it will be Radix, which launches next year. Will it be IOTA, which uses their ""Tangle"", which is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), instead of a blockchain? Not really, because all blockchains are 1-child DAGs. The Tangle is n-child. (Although you might still argue that still counts as a new iteration.) But yeah, to plan FIVE years out, identify who is creating the next technology to replace blockchain, while improving distributed consensus and decentralization, who has a world class team and great marketing, and invest into that project.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-four-crypto-currencies-that-I-should-buy-and-keep-untouched-for-at-least-five-years,"I believe that the next technology to replace blockchain is here and is named RAIDA ( Redundant Array of Independent Detecion Agents).

Fake News,What makes CNN ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in Donald Trump‚Äôs eyes?,"I am what is known these days as a ‚Äúliberal‚Äù by American standards - qualifier for what I‚Äôm about to say. The American media kinda sucks. 90% of the reporting done uses surface investigation, they all cover the same 10 subjects, they all repeat the same 10 subject ‚Äúfindings‚Äù over and over and over again, and when it comes to news commentary they angle for sensationalism over hard facts - even the commentators I prefer. Let me give you an example. The Cambridge Analytica story is HUGE. Very important. What sucks is a) the meat of the story was uncovered by the BBC and b) the most important findings were never focused on by the American media. (Hint: the way they mined info from FaceBook is bad - and that was covered by our media - the depths to which is was used and manipulated was far worse and barely, of at all, covered here. If other Americans had followed that story as closely as I had, they would have deleted their profile just as I did.) There are exceptions in both reporting and commentary. Kudos go to the Washington Post for their reporting and uncovering of Roy Moore‚Äôs disgusting past - a past that was apparently WELL KNOWN to people who knew and worked with him. (Double kudos to the brave accusers who step forward.) - WaPo‚Äôs reporting was so strong that it buried Moore in so deep that Alabama has to send a Democrat to congress instead of a pedophile. Second mention is for editorial or commentary news. Rachel Maddow recently did a GREAT job connecting dots no one else has seemed to put together - that all of the people the Trump Administration and Fox News have gone after (Rosenstein, Ohr, McCabe, etc) - or have had their security clearances revoked - are all potential witnesses in the obstruction of justice investigation (which is probably a much more solid case than collusion/conspiring with Russians ironically enough). It‚Äôs a slow moving ‚ÄúSaturday Night Massacre‚Äù that has otherwise gone undetected. I have to give her props for connecting those dots, and also doing a long-form news commentary program - which is such a break from the sensationalism and yelling/bullying you see everywhere else. So what were we talking about? Oh yeah, the US media sucks, with a few exceptions. With everything being as it is, I wish we had deeper, more meaningful coverage. We need and should expect coverage that hits hard and withstands the inevitable counterattacks. The real irony is this: when Team Trump wants to break serious news - weather it‚Äôs a leaker writing an op-ed or Trump wanting to toot his own horn - they all run out to the mainstream ‚Äúfailing/fake‚Äù media.

Solar Energy,Why don't we use surplus solar energy to produce hydrogen?,"A few reasons this is not done today.. With few exceptions, we don't really have any surplus solar energy yet. The majority of solar energy produced gets consumed on the grid, so there is no need to ""store"" it in hydrogen. This is rapidly changing, and by 2020, it is expected that places like California and Hawaii will have over generation of solar during the day on certain parts of the grid, which is going to create very challenging conditions for grid operators and utilities.  (Source:  What‚Äôs the Point of an Electricity Storage Mandate?) We have no national or even local systems for storing and transporting hydrogen. It is a difficult substance to work with, and would require a major national commitment to building out the infrastructure. The cost of electrochemical batteries like Li-Ion are dropping rapidly, to the point where the current conventional wisdom is that batteries are a more practical and cost effective way to store excess electricity generation than hydrogen. All the industry momentum is around Li-Ion, and history says that momentum matters.

Crypto Currency,Is crypto currency legal in India? Does trading in it is legal?,"What are Crypto Currencies? Crypto Currencies are decentralized virtual or digital currencies which are neither issued by any Central Bank nor are backed up by any Government. These currencies are quite popular because they provide secure and anonymous way of remittance of money and entering into a transaction. In other words, these currencies are as good as fiat currencies (i.e., legal tenders issued by the Govt. of any Country) and are acceptable as a mode of payment by some entities. By September 2017, over a thousand crypto currencies were found to exist. 2. What is a Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a type of Crypto Currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias, Satoshi Nakamoto. New Bitcoins are generated by a competitive and decentralized process called as 'Mining'. In this mining process, individuals process the transactions and secure the network by using specialized hardware and in exchange they are awarded new Bitcoins. 3. Is trading in Bitcoin legal? The RBI has neither declared the crypto currencies as illegal not it has accepted these as legal tenders. Further, RBI has clarified that it has not given any licence or authorisation to any entities to operate such schemes or deal with Bitcoins or any virtual currency. RBI has rather cautioned people about the risks associated with virtual currencies. 4. Whether Bitcoin is a currency? In common parlance, a currency means anything which is used as a circulating medium and is generally accepted in trade circles as a representative of value of property. The term ""Currency"" has also been defined inclusively in the FEMA Act, 1999. It includes currency notes, postal notes, postal orders, money orders, cheques, drafts, travellers cheques, letters of credit, bills of exchange and promissory notes, credit cards or such other similar instruments, as may be notified by the RBI. As various entities accept Bitcoins as a mode of payment, it seems that Bitcoin is a currency. However, there is another school of thought that thinks since it has not been termed as currency in FEMA Act or as legal tender by the RBI, it may not qualify as currency. Whether a Bitcoin would be classified as currency or not would be a matter of dispute and arguments until RBI clears its stand on it. If RBI declares that Bitcoin is a currency, any trading in it would be subject to FEMA Regulations. 5. Whether nature of gain derived from sale of Bitcoinsis Capital Gain or Business Income? In view of Section 2(14) of the Income-tax, Act 1961, a capital asset means a property of any kind held by a person, whether or not connected with his business or profession. The term 'property', though has no statutory meaning, yet it signifies every possible interest which a person can acquire, hold or enjoy. Therefore, Bitcoins could be deemed as capital assets if they are purchased for the purpose of investments by the taxpayers.Therefore, any gain arising on transfer of a Bitcoin shall be taxable as capital gains. However, if the transactions in bitcoins are substantial and frequent, it could be held that the taxpayer is trading in bitcoins. In this case, income from sale of Bitcoins would be taxable as business income. 6. How to compute capital gains from sale of Bitcoins? If gains arising from transfer of Bitcoins are treated as capital gains, their further classification in to short-term or long-term gain would depend upon the period of holding of Bitcoins. If a Bitcoinis held for more than 36 months from the date of purchase, it will be considered as long-term capital asset, otherwise a short-term capital asset. Short-term capital gainsare taxable as per the slab rates applicable to a taxpayer.And long-term capital gainsare taxed at the flat rate of 20% with the benefit of indexation. 7. Whether Bitcoins earned during 'Mining' process are also taxable? If profits earned from Bitcoins are taxable as business income, then the Bitcoins earned in the 'mining' process are also taxable as business profits. However, if Bitcoins are classified as capital assets, the virtual currency earned from Bitcoin 'Mining' may not be charged to tax. Bitcoins generated during the 'mining' process are classifiable as self-generated capital assets. Since, the cost of acquisition of such Bitcoins is not available, the taxpayer can take the benefit of judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of  B.C. Srinivasa Setty [1981] 5 Taxman 1 (SC) . In this case it was held that if cost of acquisition of an asset cannot be ascertained, the machinery provision for computation of capital gains will fail, therefore, no capital gains can be levied on transfer of such assets .  Therefore, Bitcoinsgenerated in the 'mining' process may be exempt from tax. 8. Where are the Bitcoins are deemed to be situated for Income-tax purposes? Bitcoins are intangible assets. For Income-tax purposes, situs of an intangible asset may vary according to their nature and obligations attached with them. Situs of intangible properties is well decided on the basis of law of the land where the protection to the property is sought. Situs of an intangible can be linked with such tangible properties with which they are most closely connected. For example, a copyright has nexus with the book or other work in respect of which copyright is sought for. The patents are associated with plant and machinery; a trademark or brand name is associated with goods. Thus, Situs of Bitcoin can be linked with the country where its operating server is located. 9. Whether sale of Bitcoin by a Non-resident through Indian Bitcoin Exchange would be charged to tax in India? Situs of a property plays an important role in determining the taxability of capital gains arising from sale of that property. Since Bitcoin is an intangible asset, income accruing or arising from its transfer outside India by a person who is not a resident in India cannot be taxed in India. Hence, Sale of Bitcoins by a Non-Resident through an Indian Bitcoin exchange may not be charged to tax. 10. Whether Bitcoin is Goods or service? If Bitcoins are classified as currencies, then it will be considered as 'Money' in CGST Act and no GST could be charged on its trading. However, exchange of a Bitcoin to Indian Rupees(INR) might be considered as service for the purpose of levy of GST under the category of 'Financial Services'. In this situation, if the supplier charges any commission for providing of an exchange services, the GST shall be payable at the rate of 18% on the amount of commission. If no consideration is being charged for the services, the supplier shall be liable to pay GST at the rate of 18% on the 1% of gross amount of INR paid by the recipient for such services of exchage. There is a conflicting view also. If Bitcoin is not considered as currency, any trading in Bitcoin would be considered as 'Service'. Therefore, supplier (who is selling the Bitcoin) might be required to pay GST at the rate of 18% on the total value charged by him from the buyer of Bitcoin. 11. What is the taxability on Bitcoins'Mining' under GST? In Bitcoin 'mining' process, the individuals process the transactions and secure the network by using specialized hardware and in exchange they are awarded new Bitcoins. In other words, Bitcoin is a consideration awarded to the individuals in lieu of their services to secure the Bitcoin Network. Therefore, the Bitcoin 'miners' might be required to pay the GST on the fair market value of the Bitcoin at the rate of 18%. 12. Whether Govt. of India can legislate to control Bitcoins? As per the Constitution of India, 1950 (Entry 36 and 46 of List I of the Seventh Schedule) states that the Central Government is allowed to legislate in respect of currency, coinage, legal tender, foreign exchange and bills of exchange, cheques, promissory notes and other like instruments respectively. Therefore, if RBI states that a Bitcoin is a currency then the Govt. of India can legislate to control the trading of Bitcoin. 13. Whether Bitcoin is a Pre-Paid Instrument? Banks are authorized to issue three kinds of pre-paid payment instruments: A. Closed System Payment Instruments B. Semi-closed System Payment Instruments C. Open System Payment Instruments. While, NBFCs and other persons have been authorized to issue only Semi-closed System Payment Instruments (like e-wallets). This means that the issuer of a pre-payment instrument must either bea bank, NBFC or a 'person'. Therefore, Bitcoin issued by the software cannot be classified as pre-paid instruments since a server or software cannot be termed as a 'person'. Further, a pre-paid instrument has pre-determined and absolute value, whereas the value of a Bitcoin is determined by market speculation, which can either be less or more than its previous original purchase value. Therefore, it cannot be said that the value stored in the Bitcoinrepresents the value paid by the holders. Hence, it cannot be considered as a prepaid instrument. 14. Is it possible to receive export proceeds in Bitcoins? Cross border transactions which involve money consideration shall attract the provisions of FEMA and Rules made there under. FEMA Regulations prescribe that the export proceeds should be received in India only in any of the notified foreign currencies (i.e., USD, Pound, Euro, etc.) Unless there is a clear directions from the RBI with regard to legality of Bitcoin or recognition of Bitcoin as a foreign currency, it is not possible to receive payment in Bitcoins to settle the export outstanding. 15. Is it possible to pay for imports in Bitcoins? The FEMA Regulations prescribe tha tpayment for imports should be made in foreign currency only. Unless there is a clear directions from the RBI with regard to legality of Bitcoin or recognition of Bitcoin as foreign currency, it is not possible to make payment in Bitcoin for imports. 16. Whether trading in Bitcoin falls under current account transaction under FEMA? The current account transaction includes all transactions which are not capital in nature,  inter-alia , remittance for import of goods or services or remittance for personal purposes, etc. The question whether dealing in Bitcoinis a current account transaction or not wholly depends on whether Bitcoin is a 'good' or an 'asset. If it is not a good, then foreign transactions in Bitcoin shall be treated as capital account transactions and any dealing in Bitcoin would require prior approval from the RBI.",https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-currency-legal-in-India-Does-trading-in-it-is-legal,,,,,

Crypto Currency,How does Crypto Currency get made?,"please do not buy cryptocurrency, pour l‚Äôamour de ciel. That said, here‚Äôs roughly how it works out. Blockchains are effectively ledgers. That‚Äôs it. There‚Äôs no actual Bitcoin anywhere in a wallet.bitcoin file or something like that. All that happens is lines are added‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt exactly how it works, but for ease of explanation, imagine lines like this.  John Wallet Gave 2.38423 BTC to Carol Wallet Carol Wallet Gave 2.3482 BTC to Dana Wallet Carol Wallet Gave 1 BTC To Carol Wallet 2  This is great, but at some point, the Bitcoin has to get ‚Äòadded‚Äô to the ledger. This is where mining comes in. Basically, you have a group of computers that are, basically, trying to ‚Äòguess‚Äô a number that is procedurally chosen. Without getting into the specifics, how hard it is to guess this number goes up and down with how hard people are trying to guess. Meanwhile, people write to the miners, ‚ÄòHi, my name is John Wallet, and I gave 2.38423 BTC to Carol Wallet. Here‚Äôs 0.00001 BTC for you if you record that for me.‚Äô That extra BTC is called a ‚Äòtransaction fee‚Äô. Miners who add that line to their version of the ledger will get that fee if they guess the right number. The successful miner will also automatically get the right to append ‚Äò12.50 Bitcoin Added To Miner Wallet‚Äô to the ledger. This is roughly how ‚Äòproof of work‚Äô functions. It‚Äôs incredibly energy inefficient, and grows only more inefficient the more it goes. Also, you can only fit so many transactions into a single block, so you can get stuck waiting for the next ‚Äòblock‚Äô. These tend to happen every ten minutes, but it can be as low as about 6, or over half an hour.  There are also ‚Äòproof of stake‚Äô coins. Proof of stake works a little differently. Proof of Stake software is when you lock a bunch of cryptocurrency in a box. There‚Äôs some ‚Äòpremined‚Äô coins for this that the devs create for themselves to jumpstart this. Instead of randomly guessing numbers, miners are chosen based on how much money they have shoved into the locked box. There‚Äôs some variation here‚Äîsome coins are interested in how long you‚Äôve staked, some are just random lotteries. Regardless, the miner still pulls transaction fees in, gets some level of coin as a reward, and the transactions confirm.  In either case, the coin rewards ‚Äòhalve‚Äô every so often. This is why Bitcoin is often referred to as deflationary. Eventually, (read: 2140 at current rates), the coin rewards from mining hit zero, and no more Bitcoin will be produced (unless the coin ‚Äòforks‚Äô, which is BASICALLY a majority of miners agreeing to change the base rules of the cryptocurrency. It‚Äôs a little more complicated than that, but it‚Äôs the Hopefully, once this happens, transaction fees will be enough to keep miners interested in processing transactions, or the entire network stops.

Crypto Currency,What advice would you give to a new crypto currency trader?," Here are the Top 7 mistakes that I have seen people make over the last years. If you don‚Äôt make these mistakes you are already better than 99% of all crypto traders. However, even if people know about all of these mistakes that they shouldn‚Äôt make, everyone makes these mistakes at least 5 times before actually having internalized them. Being emotional. The best trader is the trader without any emotions, that is not phased by a 200% increase or a 70% dip and just takes profits or rebuys more. Not buying low and selling high. This might seem obvious, but the majority of crypto traders simply do the opposite. How do I know? Because people bought in lots of Bitcoin when it was already at $15,000 and they sold lots when it was down at $10,000 and some even sold when it was down at $7,000 making it crash to $5,800. Making all or nothing buys. They either sell all of their Bitcoins or either buy all of their Bitcoins. An experienced trader only sells 10% of their Bitcoin when they have made 50% gains, another 10%, when they have made 100% gains and always sell another 10% of their Bitcoins the higher it goes. That way, they always make profits and also have money to rebuy the dips. Inexperienced traders never sell, because they become too greedy or sell everything too early. Putting all of their eggs in 1 basket. Don‚Äôt only hold 1 coin, hold the best 10 coins you can find and one of them will likely make a 1,000% return and make up for the losses of all the other 9 coins. Putting all their coins on 1 wallet. Have your coins distributed through exchanges, online wallets, cold wallets and paper wallet, so that if one gets hacked or you lose it, you don‚Äôt lose it all. Invest more that they can afford to lose. If you put more money into crypto than you can afford to lose, you also become much more emotional and make bad trades. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. Instead, only put 10%of your whole networth maximum into crypto. Buying coins that are hyped without any substantial improvement in tech. Examples are: EOS, Tron, Bitcoin, Litecoin. EOS is worse than Elastos, but has a 20x higher market cap, only through hype and also possibly through artificial pumping by the EOS team. It is extremely centralized with 21 voting nodes and Elastos offers a lot more functionality for dapps and is even more scalable. This is why EOS will drop in price significantly soon while Elastos will go up. Tron should only be worth a few hundred million but is worth billion, because Justin Sun was thought to have a partnership with Alibaba even though he only attended the same university as Jack Ma.",https://www.quora.com/What-advice-would-you-give-to-a-new-crypto-currency-trader,Great advice.

Therfore, any government or regulatory interventions can be seen from the lens of protection from erosion of their powers. Blockchain technology is trustless at its core. Thus, attempts to use 20th. century regulatory practices should be carefully scrutinized by the crypto community, and not merely accepted as an ultimate reality. Remember, blockchain technology doesn't bode well for government bodies, or anybody in the center. In a sense, its the begaining of the end for them, as we know them. The purpose of government is to centralize power, and govern, and govern some more.

Ok, if you want to join an exchange you should prove who you are, but not if you are just buying or selling some crypto! Crypto should be regulatory treated like money. After all, if you go into a shop, and pay by credit card or cash, you could be laundering money, but can you imagine the queues at the tills if you had to positively identify yourself when you bought something? In NYC it can cost you $100000 to become a regulated crypto trader, which is ridiculous and is a constriction on people‚Äôs right to do what they want with their own money. Regulation should be a simple and cheap process, and you should be able to retrospectively get regulation, bearing in mind that millions of people are already crypto trading.

Fake News,What percentage of Trump supporters believe in his fake news theory?,"For me (and I should point out that I‚Äôm not really a ‚ÄúTrump supporter‚Äù ‚Äî I voted for him, but that was mostly out of dislike for Secretary Clinton,) the whole ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù thing arose out of a series of stories earlier this year, when the mainstream media (usually the  New York Times ,  Washington Post  and network television,) published things that were based on anonymous sources, but which were quickly shown to be complete fiction. One example being the meeting that the President had with high ranking Russian officials in the White House last spring. Citing anonymous sources, the media reported that the President had given out classified information to the Russians, which feeds into the narrative that he ‚Äúowes‚Äù the Russians for their help in the 2016 elections. Immediately, the other three people in the room, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Dina Powell all disputed the claims and openly testified that President Trump had done nothing of the sort. So, you had, on the one hand, some anonymous sources, who could be saying any old bollocks, and on the other, three named officials, all of whom were there, saying the opposite. And yet,  the media outlets stood by their original story , trying to dissect the statements of Tillerson, McMaster and Powell to show that they were not being truthful. ( Source ) It has seemed to taper off lately, whether through a crackdown on leaks by the government, or the media actually bothering to vet their ‚Äúanonymous sources,‚Äù but the assault on the President by the mainstream media continues. I usually watch the local news on the NBC station here in Central Florida, and, as a result, unless I think about it, NBC Nightly News is usually playing in my house at 6:30. For a couple of weeks, I decided to pay more than a passing glance at it, and took note of the stories covered early in the broadcast (which are generally the ‚Äúhard news.‚Äù) With a few exceptions,  on every single broadcast , the first or second news story was a negative story about President Trump. It began to get comical ‚Äî some of the stories were justified, of course, but a lot of them were pretty superficial and seemed to be aired simply to have something negative to say about the President. If you‚Äôve a mind to, do the same thing and see if you don‚Äôt see it the same way.

Fake News,What is the best way to avoid fake news today?,"The best way to avoid ""fake news"" is to be an informed reader. Check the sources and the inks. Do they seem credible to you, or do they appear to be conspiracy theorists, trolls o nut jobs? Google anything that you think sounds fake. Look for corroborating stories in other credible media. If there are only one or two media running a story, that's a pretty good indicator that there's something fishy about it. Finally, just apply some common sense. Does the story seem likely to you, or is it far-fetched. If it doesn't pass your own ""smell test,"" there's a good chance it's fake news. The next best way to avoid fake news is to read sources you've learned to trust. For all of President Trump's wailing about it on Twitter, the media is not dishonest. Good editors go to great lengths to make sure a story is true before they publish. Sensationalists will publish anything and wait for the fallout. Once again, be an informed reader. Much of what's labeled today as ""fake news"" is clickbailt. It's not hard to distinguish between news, opinion, and ad content, but you do have to pay attention. Items that look like news, but have labels like ""You might also like"" or ""Sponsored,"" are not news, they're ads, and the publisher has little, if any, oversight. They are not written, endorsed or sponsored by the media in which they appear. This is a distinction that many people fail to make, and one that explains much of the hullabaloo over ""fake news."" Finally, a politician calling any media biased or dishonest does not make it so. Politicians and the media frequently oppose each other. That's healthy discourse in a free society. The president has elevated it to a whole new level.

Solar Energy,Could solar energy completely replace fossil fuel one day? What are the disadvantages of solar energy?,"Yes, and no. Ultimately, all fossil fuel  is  solar energy- it‚Äôs stored solar power, baked into the hydrocarbon bonds of the stuff we know as oil and coal and natural gas. This stuff has been building up in reservoirs around the planet for millions of years, and we‚Äôve only just figured out how to get it and use it in the last couple of centuries. The one thing that fossil fuels have going for them is that they‚Äôve solved the energy storage problem- hell, they  are  energy storage, accumulated over the time-scale of the last tens, hundreds of millions of years. By contrast, modern solar energy allows us to generate electrical currents, when the sun is shining, and either do work with it immediately, or charge up a battery, or use the energy to form molecules we can crack later for energy. The obstacles to a total switch to contemporary solar energy are that we‚Äôre not very good at storing the energy we‚Äôve captured at scale. Oh, we can load up batteries and use them, but they‚Äôre heavy, expensive, and finite in number. This makes them less-optimal for specific uses (like, for example, fueling an airplane) that call for lots of energy, in a dense, not-that-heavy package. Liquid hydrocarbons are in no danger of being replaced by battery-driven systems in aviation, for just this reason. Today, we‚Äôre consuming our hydrocarbon fuel stores at a rate that‚Äôs much faster than they were accumulating- it‚Äôs like we‚Äôve stumbled into a calorie trust-fund that contains small deposits over a hundred-million-year span, and we‚Äôre spending it at a rate that‚Äôs thousands of times as fast as it built up. In this sense, eventually we  will  end up running on current solar power, assuming we don‚Äôt exhaust our readily-available/cheaply-extractable fossil fuel stores. This will involve a huge reduction in steady-state expenditure vs. today‚Äôs levels of fossil-fuel consumption.",https://www.quora.com/Could-solar-energy-completely-replace-fossil-fuel-one-day-What-are-the-disadvantages-of-solar-energy,,,,,

A good quality PV system cost around 70,000 per kW from 100 to 200 kW and it can come down to 55,000 per kW when the capacity of the plant increase. This cost includes everything from PV panels to commissioning of project to couple it with your electricity line.  Now government has withdrawn subsidy for Solar PV. But u can avail accelerated depreciation (25% of project cost) for industrial and commercial customers ,  if your profitable. 2) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)
In this method the supplier will install the PV plant at your premises or other premises depending on the space availability and kW capacity you need.  You don't need to pay anything to the supplier. After the plant is commissioned supplier will have a Energy meter and charge you some price per kWh delivered.  The cost per kWh depends on various factors.
1) premises where the plant is installed.
2) Transmission cost of Electricity board
3) Solar irradiation at the location
4) Tenure period The cost per kWh in India is from Rs. 5 to 7 rupees depending on the above factors. But it will definitely less that the Electricity board price. But in PPA model the only thing you have to give to supplier is Bank Guarantee. They will ask a 12 month bank guarantee for a projected savings.  So in PPA model you will reap benefits from the starting itself.
But if you see for long run the total profit from outright will be higher than that of PPA model.  Solar is definitely profitable. And also you will reduce  0.4 kg of CO2 emission for every kWh you consume from solar.",https://www.quora.com/Solar-Energy-I-want-to-establish-a-1MW-solar-power-plant-in-Maharashtra-Will-it-be-profitable,How to ink PPA with distributors.

Solar Energy,Why is India lagging behind in terms of solar energy?,"India is not lagging in terms of solar energy production and installation. We are growing at a very fast pace when it comes to solar energy production. We currently produce almost 60GW of solar energy, but in comparison to our potential, we are way behind. Top 10 solar-producing countries But we have challenges and problems with solar energy production which most people don‚Äôt know. The biggest problem of all is  intermittency . The electricity market is very complex. Whatever electricity is produced by electricity generators which is the supply has to meet the demand of electricity by consumers. The demand is very high during the early morning and in the evening when everybody goes to their home and switch on their AC‚Äôs and TV. The solar energy supply is at a peak in the afternoon and rapidly decreases in the evening. This phenomenon of clear mismatch between demand and supply is called the duck curve.  The second big problem is  power inertia . Solar generators do not produce inertia while fossil fuel generator does. This lack of inertia makes the grid unstable and vulnerable. This concept is similar to the concept of inertia. Let me try to explain it with a simple example. Let‚Äôs say there is 2kg block travelling at a speed v collides with another block of 1kg resting with no speed. Assuming elastic collision(no deformity), the 2kg block will travel at speed v/3 and 1 kg block at speed 4v/3.  Now, the 2kg block has more inertia than 1kg block due to its mass, but  the change in the speed of 2kg block is |v/3-v|= 2v/3 change in the speed of 1kg block is 4v/3‚Äì0=4v/3 Due to 1 kg low inertia, there is a lot of change in its velocity compared to 2kg block. Now, replace the 1 kg block with 8 kg block resting. The new speeds will be 2kg=negative (-3v/5) 8kg= (2v/5) the change in speed for 8kg is 2v/5‚Äì0=2v/5 the change in speed for 2kg is |-3v/5-v|=8v/5 Thus, high inertia, less change in that system, less vulnerability. So, similarly, if many power generators are producing synchronous generation builds some inertia and some renewable power generators get into the grid which is not in sync, the grid will be stable as the change in frequency will not be that much, but with very low power inertia, the grid will collapse and is vulnerable. Thus we need fossil fuel generators to provide inertia. These are some technical problems that I just mentioned, but this is happening everywhere, why India is lagging. Well, the purpose of addressing these technical issues is to give you a context of the other big problems from the market perspective. As you know, the development of the solar park involves a comprehensive system which is done by the  SECI-Solar Energy Corporation of India. For eg, The SECI releases a tender that a solar park is to be built of 100 GW in some rural area of Kota district and invites developers to bid for the project. The bidding is done on two parameters- the tariff price and the viability gap fund The tariff price is the price that the solar developer will get in return for producing 1 unit of electricity. it is currently hovering at Rs 2.5/ kWh. The one with lowest tariff bid is chosen. Solar tariffs see a modest rise at SECI auction The viability gap fund is the bid for which the developers needs funds for initial development. The one with the lowest bid for the fund is chosen. This method is popular nowadays and is called a reverse auction mechanism. Combining these 2 bids and giving some weight to both depending on the park, the lowest overall bid is selected and that developer is invited to sign a Power purchasing agreement aka PPA. Now there are many challenges in this kind of mechanism. 1. Once the auction is done, the SECI becomes a facilitator between the electricity distributor aka retailer and the solar developer. Unfortunately, many electricity distributors are financially unstable and run at huge losses and if one will read the electricity act, 2013, each electricity distributor has to develop a robust financial model without any bailouts from central or state govt. This reduces makes the credibility of these distributors in paying the developers on time. There are many instances when distributors have gone bankrupt. That‚Äôs why the developers demand a payment security mechanism which is an escrow fund which the developer can access if the distributor doesn‚Äôt oblige with the PPA. How many distributors don't want to pay for an escrow account and thus many distributors are hesitant to procure Solar energy. 2. The other thing is that most of the times the transmission companies which are state-owned in India involves in red-tapism and due to their monopoly, they want a huge amount of bribe so that they can build those transmission lines. Most transmission companies simply deny these developers if the solar park is in a very remote location. 3. The land acquisition is another big problem and one has to go through so many untransparent and restrictive administrative rules and laws in procuring even an inch of land. The onus of providing land should be with the govt and not the developers to rectify this problem. 4. There are many other redundant administrative bottlenecks which hamper their development. For eg, in one particular case, I am aware, there was an auction of a solar park in the western part of MP.All the developers are required to have clearance through an environmental assessment report of the solar park from the MP department of housing and environment when they're about to bid. The department took huge bribes from each developer for the report. Instead, the govt can do the environmental assessment and collect the costs distributed between each developer while bidding. This is a very inefficient way of procuring solar energy and the problem lies mainly in the administrative process. This whole process is to make you understand how the utility-scale solar procurement works. But there is a new kind of energy production is on the rise which is called rooftop solar. The rooftop solar is like solar panels installed on your house roof and connected to your meter and the household use solar energy when the solar panels are producing. The major problem in the uptake of these solar panels is the capital cost and lack of maintenance. However, the govt can do 2 things- 1. The govt can implement differential tariffs-which are time-varying tariffs in which consumers will be charged more when there is a high mismatch between demand and supply which we call the peak hours. These tariffs can incentivise consumers to store the electricity produced by solar panels in batteries and use it during peak hours to avoid high tariffs. 2. The other thing govt can do is that can provide green certificates to these rooftop solar installers for every installation they will provide. The rationale for these green certificates is that they are renewables with very less CO2 emissions. These green certificates can later be traded in the market which will provide an out of market revenue. In that case, the installers will be willing to install rooftop solar panels at a highly subsidised rate because they can get revenue from selling certificates. I have read some other answers which mention that the solar panels have to be imported from China and our energy dependence will be on China. I feel that China has a comparative advantage of producing solar panels and unless we do not produce solar panels cheaper than China, this cannot be the reason for the slower adoption of solar energy. As a society, Our objective is to provide affordable and easily accessible, low carbon energy to everyone and no other factor can be prioritised over this.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-behind-in-terms-of-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,How accurate was Elon Musk's graphic about the solar energy needed to power the United States during his Powerwall presentation?,"Its accurate based on the assumption that you can generate 0.2KWH per square metre for an average of 6 hours each day. US Energy demand is 25,451e9KWH/year which is 2.9e9KWH/hour.  Under peak sun a 100% efficient solar panel can produce 1KWH per square metre. This means you need 2.9e9 square metres to keep up with demand. This is a square 54km x 54km. However panels are only about 20% efficient so we need 5x that surface area to make up for it. This brings us to a 120km square and I am guessing it will only receive good sunlight about 1/4 of the time which means we need to up our square to 241km x 241km which is probably about the size of that square.",https://www.quora.com/How-accurate-was-Elon-Musks-graphic-about-the-solar-energy-needed-to-power-the-United-States-during-his-Powerwall-presentation,,,,,
Solar Energy,How far can solar energy travel?,"Some Jupiter probes use solar power at 480 million miles from the Sun, but Saturn (890 million miles) and beyond use nuclear batteries. Imaging of Pluto (3.5 billion miles) and Ultima Thule (4 billion miles) was illuminated by Solar power, which was too weak to power a machine from a manageable PV array but sufficient to stimulate electron flow in an optical sensor. New Horizons will be unable to image in deep space, but by that time radio signals will be too weak to read. We can image the most powerful ancient stars near the cosmic event horizon, which is ~46 billion light years away. ========================================= If you are asking how far Solar energy converted to electricity can travel, our electric power is linked in continent-wide grids, so 3,000 miles theoretically. This is really only practical for sharing load-balancing power between adjacent regions, so sending dawn electricity from the Atlantic to Pacific is not practical nor is sending dusk electricity in reverse. The biggest problem with renewable energy is intermittency. It is only available when the sun shines or when the wind blows. This was normal before fossil fuels made 24/7 energy practical, and soon non-stop energy will be impractical again. We will need to adapt to storing heat (thermal Solar power is 5 times as efficient as Solar electricity) and using energy when the sun shines.",https://www.quora.com/How-far-can-solar-energy-travel,Storing solar energy as heat allows us to generate electricity at night.,"At the distance of Pluto sunlight is around 40 times as bright as the full moon.

Fake News,Why did Firstpost acquire Faking News?,"Simple answer is that Network 18 (Firstpost) believed they can make more money from faking news than what they paid for it.  Benefits that Firstpost could have seen in fakingnews
 1. Well established brand . Most of the Indian netizens know and have a positive opinion about fakingnews. Firstpost might have some ideas in taking this brand further through new properties in online satire/humor or through its offline properties. e.g. faking  news weekly segment in CNN-IBN may not be a bad idea 2. Talent Acquisition  - Humor websites are serious online business. And the acquisition might be a way to acquire talent for a future humor website under Network 18's online ventures. I am sure that the agreement would have a lock-in period for the founders to stay with firstpost - before moving on to other ventures.  3. Future Valuation  - It might have been simply that the advertising or other revenues that Network 18 forecasted was substantially higher than internal fakingnews' projection 4. Users:  In one payment, firstpost has access to million of followers of faking news across various social networking portals. 5. Technology:  Any popular network needs both a huge amount of technology - at its back end for a seamless user experience. These expertise and costs on a shared basis - would come at a much more cheaper rate.  More than firstpost acquiring faking news, i was surprised by faking news selling their website.

Fake News,Why is fake news a threat to democracy?,"Modern democracy is rather reliant on having a population who are at least somewhat familiar with the facts and details of the policies that governments must choose between. Worth a small historical detour here: one of the main arguments against an expansion of the voting franchise in 19th Century Britain was that the ‚Äòilliterate‚Äô lower classes had neither the wit nor the education to understand the complexities of politics (the same argument applied to women). (Source - worth reading:  higher-history-the-growth-of-democracy-1832-1928.pdf ) Although the argument is pretty offensive when viewed today, for various obvious reasons, the idea that voters need to be well-informed about the facts in order to make a decision is fundamentally sound. The need to try and ensure voters are not misled is important. Indeed, in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, it is illegal for any person to publish any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct, unless he or she can show that he had reasonable grounds for believing that statement to be true. Representation of the People Act 1983 - Wikipedia Fake news is an obvious problem as it intentionally misinforms voters.

Fake News,Do you think Trump loves or hates fake news?,"What you need to know is that in the looking glass unreality of what passes for Trump‚Äôs mind, all normal laws of veracity are inverted. If he's calling something ‚Äúfake news‚Äù, you can bet your bottom dollar that it's a properly sourced piece of reputable journalism with based on independent confirmatory sources. However, this truth will be unpalatable to him. To Trump's unsubtle way of thinking, ‚ÄúI don't like this‚Äù translates as bad and ergo he rejects it as fake.

Fake News,What's the difference between propaganda and fake news?,"Here is my interpretation: The concept of, ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù is relatively new: there has definitely been ‚ÄúFake news‚Äù in the past (Through all of history), but the term Fake News seems to circle a phenomena that has become much different in the internet age. Fake News is, simply put, news stories that appear to be a legitimate news source, but whose factual basis is completely or primarily invented. These stories have no basis in reality. They are created with a particular goal in mind. This can be political (Pizzagate, for example, fabricated stories masquerading as real with the intent of making certain parties look bad), but it can also just be something someone does for fun. The motivation may be to discredit someone, to make gullible people believe a discrediting story so they can later appear foolish, or any other reason. The core is that the story is fabricated, and masquerading as real, and it has become such a thing because that model is perfect for the internet age. It spreads like no other time in history, and appears more credible more easilly. Interestingly, a lot of fake news was originally created with the intent of making those who believe it look foolish. The problem is that after these fake news makers revealed their fraud‚Ä¶no one cared. People kept believing the story because that was convenient. The people who revealed the hoax were called liars. Clearly, people believed what they wanted to believe. Propaganda is any one sided attempt to change peoples beliefs. Fake News can be propaganda, but so can saturation of real news that happens to support a viewpoint (usually to the exception of more negative stories), works of fiction with a certain viewpoint, highly slanted perspectives‚Ä¶and its not always necessarily bad. You can argue that noble causes fairly use truthful propaganda, though usually Propaganda specifically carries a negative connotation. As a point of clarification, we also have, ‚ÄúSatire‚Äù. This is different from fake news. It is invented, however, it also makes no attempt to deceive people into thinking it is real. Sometimes people mistake satire for news, but the key is that the intent behind satire is to make an artistic statement about a viewpoint through fiction, not to make people believe the fiction is real, in much the same way that a Bond movie is meant to be fun without trying to convince you that Daniel Craig really killed a bunch of people (and some people might be dim enough to believe that, but that really is their fault, and not the movies.) Today, ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù has been co-opted by the president to mean any news or reporting that is inaccurate (Or more accurately, that he doesn‚Äôt like). This is useful, because it draws a line between something totally, objectively false, and something that is simply not to his liking. It makes matters of opinion into matters of fact, and narrows peoples worldview to only that which he approves of. Really, when Trump says fake news, he really just means inaccurate journalism, and tries to blur the line between that and outright lying. Its a very hard to parse distinction that he uses.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-propaganda-and-fake-news,"I have to disagree as to what Trump means when he says ‚ÄúFake News.‚Äù You say he ‚Äúreally just means inaccurate journalism.‚Äù In fact, he means factually correct, investigative journalism that is negative toward him, or any news that accurately represents him in a negative light.

Real news is hard to get, and expensive at that. Considering that the media is a for-profit venture, why not just go with gossip and innuendo? After all, that is what YOU want to hear. If you are offended, then let me ask you this; where do you get your news and why? Do you watch CNN because you hate Trump? Fox News because you love Trump (or hate Obama‚Ä¶).

Fake News,What does fake news and alternative facts mean?,"‚ÄúAlternative facts‚Äù are lies.

When challenged on the veracity of Spicer‚Äôs statements (that is, when the interviewer Chuck Todd asked Conway how Spicer could have lied in the face of the facts), Conway declared Spicer had given ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù. Hopefully, it is a term that will now go down in history as a defining statement of the Trump years. ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù is a narrative constructed to push a particular political point of view that is also not based on facts. It is a tool created in its present incarnation in the United States by the rightwing propaganda machine. To camouflage its real purpose of distorting the public discourse and propagating a particular political agenda under the radar of the voter, it takes the appearance of ‚Äúnews‚Äù, because it originates from outlets that pretend that they are journalism like Fox News and Breitbart. Fake News works like this: rumors ‚Äúsurface‚Äù that President Obama was not born in the United States, and was therefore not eligible to even run for the office.

Just a grassroot movement of libertarians and computer geeks who wanted to challenge the status quo and bring down the corrupt collusion between greedy banks and corrosive government. Than suddenly something strange started to happen. In 2017 the media which has ignored Bitcoin all along started to talk about it non stop. And it brought Bitcoin out of the closet. But it also invited a bunch of people into the fold. All a bunch of speculator wannabees and kewl high school kids who didn‚Äôt have a clue what Bitcoin is all about. They don‚Äôt know that Bitcoin is the solution because they mostly don‚Äôt even know what the problem is to start with. The media suddenly talking ad nauseum about Bitcoin is what caused the 2017 roller coaster ride of Bitcoin. But if you ignore the media induced bubble, Bitcoin is worth 4x more today than any time prior to 2017 bubble.  Bitcoin is worth more now than ever before the media bubble. So I‚Äôm not sure what you mean by a come back. Bitcoin will likely keep growing at a steady pace. But if you want to get into Bitcoin, you first need to learn about the problem Bitcoin intends to solve. For that, I suggest you read the book  ‚ÄúThe Creature From Jekyll Island‚Äù  .

Solar Energy,Solar energy vs. shale oil extraction - which is better?,"July 31, 2014   |
For the last few months, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere  have been at record levels  unseen in over 800,000 years. The chairman of the IPCC, an international panel of the world‚Äôs top climate scientists, warned earlier this year that  ‚Äúnobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change‚Äù .
Future generations will no doubt wonder at our response, given the scale of the threat.  It‚Äôs known that death, poverty and suffering await millions , and yet governments still vacillate. But solutions are available. Here are ten reasons to be hopeful that humans will rise to the challenge of climate change.
 1) Barack Obama has made it one of his defining issues.
Any politician who runs as the personification of hope is bound to be a bit of a let down. And so it seemed for five long, hot years. Barack Obama inaugurated his first US presidential term by promising to ‚Äúroll back the spectre of a warming planet‚Äù. Yet he seemed unable (or willing) to even roll back the ghosts haunting his Congress. Now, as he staggers into his legacy-building stage, Obama has confronted and even circumvented Congress. His  emissions caps on coal power stations , announced last month were the culmination of a  massive public relations push  and  scientific blitzkrieg  with Obama as its champion, potentially making the next presidential election a referendum on climate change action.
 2) China has ordered coal power plants to close.
Just a day after the launch of Obama‚Äôs big crackdown on coal, He Jiankun,  a top Chinese government climate advisor told Reuters , ‚ÄúThe government will use two ways to control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan, by intensity and an absolute cap‚Äù. This was the first time the promise of limiting absolute emissions had emerged from a source close to the Chinese leadership (even if He was later forced to disown the comments).
The response of world‚Äôs largest emitter of carbon has the potential to be swift and decisive, given its centrally controlled economy. Responding to smog-tired residents in China‚Äôs cities, the government has ordered a mass shutdown of coal plants within a few years . Coal control measures now exist in 12 of the country‚Äôs 34 provinces.  Greenpeacehave estimated that if these measures are implemented, it could bring China‚Äôs emissions close to the level the  International Energy Agency  says are needed to avoid more than 2C warming.

 3) The cost of solar has fallen by two thirds.
According to the authoritative IEA thinktank, the price of installing photovoltaic (solar electricity) systems dropped by two thirds over the past six years. The resulting solar explosion has generated a ‚Äúprosumer‚Äù market, in which the owners of homes and businesses are taking ownership of a growing proportion of the energy supply. During June in Australia‚Äôs ‚Äúsunshine state‚Äù of Queensland  the price of electricity fell below zero for several days , largely thanks to the input from privately-owned solar panels. The UK, Germany and other European nations  smashed their record solar outputs  over this year‚Äôs summer solstice.
 4) People are taking their money out of fossil fuels.
Dozens of cities, institutions and investors are taking their money out of fossil fuel companies after the launch of a divestment campaign in the US around 18 months ago. Similar campaigns were used in the past to hamstring apartheid South Africa and tobacco companies,  but this one is happening faster than any of those . Supporters of the movement include former US vice president Al Gore,  who says fossil fuel companies are overvalued  because they cannot burn the assets they own if the world is to avoid dangerous climate change. ‚ÄúInvestors have so far been slow to appreciate the implications for the carbon-intensive assets within their portfolios.‚Äù

 5) Bangladeshi women are being retrained as solar technicians.
The  UN says global warming will impact more women than men  because they make up the majority of the world‚Äôs poor. Close to two billion people rely on wood, charcoal and agricultural waste for cooking and heating. The primary gatherers of this toxic, labour- and carbon-intensive energy source are women. Thus, the education and social emancipation of women could be one of the greatest catalysts for grassroots climate action. Bangladeshi women who previously lived without electricity have been  retraining as solar technicians  to bring power to the country‚Äôs 95 million people who live without electric light. The country now has the fastest growing solar sector in the world with 2 million households fitted with solar power units.
 6) Renewable energy will soon take the lion‚Äôs share of new power.
Falling technology prices, innovation and some decent government initiatives have seen renewables taking an increasing share of global electricity generation. After stalling through the early part of last decade, the increase is now inexorable. The sector, flushed with confidence, has begun to attract the kind of sustained investment growth of which most industries can only dream.  In 2013 investors contributed US$268.2 billion to renewable projects ‚Äì 5 times more than in 2004. The average growth of US$24 billion per year is in the same ball park as the riotous expansion of venture capital during the late 90s dot com bubble, except it has already lasted five time longer. Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that by 2030  spending on renewable energy sources  could make up two thirds of a global energy spend of US$7.7 trillion.
 7) European homes are using 15% less energy than they were in 2000.
In every part of the world (barring the Middle East) governments are taking advantage of the  cheapest way to bring down their emissions  ‚Äì by saving energy. Energy efficient housing and appliances have seen global household emissions drop almost 1% per year, which doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot, but a 1% drop over a year is equivalent to every resident of New York going completely off grid. In the EU, households reduced their consumption by 15.5% between 2000 and 2011. In the developing world, where urban populations are booming and millions of new homes will need to be built,  the IPCC has said  there is a ‚Äúwindow of opportunity‚Äù to create sustainable housing for the future. Since 2009, the  United Nations‚Äô Sushi programme  has been training local builders and planners in Thailand, Brazil, India and Bangladesh to use low cost energy efficient building practices for social housing projects.
 8) Cutting emissions has become a business imperative.
 A recent WWF/Ceres report  found that the 53 US Fortune 100 companies who report their emissions had cut their carbon footprint by 58 million megatons in 2012 - roughly equivalent to the total emissions of Peru. This was achieved mainly through energy efficiency measures, although switching to green energy sources was also a factor. These measures are turning out to be not just cost effective but actually a business imperative. Each megatonne reduction saved an average of US$19 - a total of US$1.1 billion across just 53 companies. In the UK, tyre manufacturer  Michelin has dropped its ¬£20 million energy bill by 20%  in five years by employing energy managers.  ‚Äú[Climate] adaptation is just good business,‚Äù say analysts from PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 9) Oil is becoming much more expensive to find.
Oil and gas companies are finding it increasingly expensive to find and extract their buried gravy.  The Wall Street Journal reported in January  the total capital expenditure of fossil giants Chevron, Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell grew to ¬£70 billion in 2013, yet all three have experienced huge declines in production relative to cost as their budgets are stretched by the need to open new wells in challenging environments. Off the coast of Brazil, huge oil fields lie more than 5km beneath the deep ocean floor. Despite the world‚Äôs largest corporate spending program (¬£138 bn),  national driller Petrobras is being driven towards the wall  by the crippling expense of drilling so deep.
One area where the shift from Promised Land to land of compromise has been exemplified is the Arctic. Oil companies see the region‚Äôs melting sea ice as a fine opportunity to recover vast untapped reserves. But the costs of exploring the region have proved too great for Shell, who  after spending ¬£5bn, have shelved their exploration in the region . Many other companies, although notably not Russian behemoth Gazprom, have ruled out Arctic exploration in the foreseeable future. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see any oil production in the Arctic any time soon. Probably not this decade and not the next,‚Äù Lundin Petroleum chairman Ian Lundin said in February. ‚ÄúThe commercial challenges are too big.‚Äù
 10) Electric car sales are doubling each year.
Since 2011 electric car sales have doubled every year. Consumer acceptance of the technology is on an exponential growth curve that  researchers say  will see more than one million such vehicles driven across the world by the end of 2015. Five years ago, the technology was a quirky, futuristic gimmick lacking any serious impact on the global car market.  Questions were raised about its price competitiveness . But in Norway, one in every hundred cars is now electric. Beyond the oft-enlightened Norse, the technology has a growing foothold in the US (which is by far the largest single market with 174,000 cars), Japan (68,000) and China (45,000).",https://www.quora.com/Solar-energy-vs-shale-oil-extraction-which-is-better,"The lure of free energy

In the 1950s we were assured by the best scientific minds that nuclear electricity would be free and it would not make sense to meter it. The Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty granted every country the right to enrich and the nuclear haves promised the nuclear havenots that they would help them develop nuclear electricity to increase their economic well being. It may not be clear what went wrong but it is still very difficult to determine the economics of nuclear electricity because the fuel is provided by the government and its price may not be indicative of its cost.

The U.S. government tried to get private industry to process nuclear fuel but had a difficult time finding takers. Union Carbide made an offer that required government guarantees and big upfront cash. Maybe Union Carbide knew something about nuclear fuel processing cost since they were operating a government nuclear fuel processing plant in Tennessee which happened to be the biggest electricity user in the U.S. Other concerns about nuclear electricity cost include the fact that much of the nuclear fuel available today is a result of a scaling back in nuclear weapons by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. and of course the processing waste and the plant closure cost.

Bill Gates and other smart people are funding research on backyard nuclear power plants. Backyard nukes sound interesting and have a long history. In the late 1940s and early 1950s nuclear power was seen to be an attractive source even at very small scale, including for automobiles and aircraft, and a lot of money was spent on aircraft nuclear power. The world‚Äôs most esteemed nuclear physicists pronounced the practicability of nuclear reactors for these purposes, and the U.S. government gave encouragement and big dollars to these efforts. Oil companies were assured this was going to happen and were eager to participate. General Atomics was Gulf and Shell spending big on ‚ÄúAtoms for Peace‚Äù and hiring the best scientific minds to insure success.

After the small scale nuke bubble collapsed, nuclear industrial parks became all the rage and it was deemed that big electric users such as aluminum and fertilizer makers would colocate with nuclear power plants and this would result in great cost reductions which would improve our economic well being. It‚Äôs not clear what happened.
The Rasmussen report was used to insure us that a Three Mile Island type incident would only happen every 500,000 reactor years. Then there was Chernobyl and Fukushima.

Small scale nuclear power plants transfer heat from fission to water and reject heat to the local environment and the heat exchangers can dominate the cost. The 4MeV neutrons produced by fission are rough on materials and greatly increase the plant cost relative to other heat sources. Imagine dealing with the 14Mev neutrons from fusion, another ‚Äúfree‚Äù energy hoax.

Solar electricity from photovoltaics is said to be free once you pay for the system but the overall cost is several times greater than the grid supplied cost of fossil fuel generated electricity and this means that to get an equivalent amount of electrical energy from photovoltaics that several times the fossil fuel energy is expended in the manufacture, installation, operation, and maintenance and as a consequence more pollutants are generated and our standard of living is reduced.
Photovoltaics are produced with low cost Chinese labor and coal fired electricity and installed on the homes of the wealthy in the West, where the governments force the utilities to purchase the electricity from the photovoltaic arrays at high rates and pass the costs on to the legitimate ratepayers, who are the victims of this scheme. Photovoltaic systems must also promise an unproven and unrealistic lifetime to complete the hoax.

 Intermittent/inconsistent energy sources such as solar and wind do not allow a reduction in the number or size of power plants  and in fact there is a requirement for rapid response power plants which are much costlier and much less efficient and because they are often idled, they have longer payback periods. Solar and wind produce shock loads on utility grids which are costly to accommodate.

It‚Äôs intriguing that the National Renewal Energy Laboratory, previously the Solar Energy Research Institute, with 37 years of solar research and development work can claim an inability to find reliable data on photovoltaic system operating and maintenance costs, since they have been monitoring photovoltaic systems for decades and have associations with other organizations that have been monitoring photovoltaic systems for decades. Photovoltaic electricity cost, including failures, whether absorbed by taxpayers, rate payers, insurers, installers, or investors, are part of the cost of solar electricity, just as failed wells are part of the price of gas and oil. Photovoltaic failures such as BP, Solar City, Abound, and Solyndra are part of the cost of PV electricity.
If the operating and maintenance costs associated with photovoltaic systems were anywhere near the rosy prediction of the advocates, that information  would be available and deafening. We shouldn't have to depend on the New York Times and law journals to learn the real world problems associated  with photovoltaic systems.

 If photovoltaic electricity was less costly than grid supplied electricity, photovoltaics would be used to make photovoltaics.

Smart people in government agencies the 1970s and 1980s funded solar water heaters that cost more in electricity to run the pumps and controls than the potential savings in water heating costs and these people never seemed to have the time or interest to study the situation. The initial cost of these solar water heating systems could be more than 100 times the annual ‚Äú potential‚Äù  savings. In Southern California the average home spent ~$80.00/year on natural gas for water heating and the solar water heating systems might save half of this or ~$40.00/year. The government rebate for solar could be $5500.00 for the maximum allowed system cost ($11,000.00) and of course smart people learned to get the maximum rebate on all systems. The active systems required costly maintenance and rarely operated more than a few years.

Smart people in the U.S. government decided to fund corn to ethanol with a cost to the economy of hundreds of billions of dollars

 U.S.  corn and cellulose to ethanol conversion plants consume large amounts of low cost natural gas and coal fired electricity to produce a fuel for which the federal government generates a market thru mandates.

 If corn to ethanol made sense, ethanol would be used to fuel the process.

U.S. government energy experts knew when oil was $2/barrel and synfuels were $8/barrel that synfuels would make economic sense when oil got to $8/barrel and when oil got to $8/barrel they funded synfuels and were surprised that synfuels cost $32/barrel but were never able to grasp the fact that it required 4/barrels of oil equivalent energy to manufacture a barrel of synfuels with 1 barrel of oil equivalent energy. The significance of this still cannot be grasped and we are instead increasing our funding of corn to ethanol. It may be that the current energy secretary can grasp the situation but the purchase of corn state votes is deemed of greater importance. Nothing has to be real, it only has to sold.

 There is a studied unwillingness to see cost as the important metric-money is just a trading unit of energy.

 Rising German Coal Use Imperils European Emissions Deal

Germany tries to create a pretty  picture of their energy policy and has largely succeeded in fooling the public and pleasing the Greens. German electric costs have soared and are now more than twice U.S. electric cost and rising fast. The only help is that they are burning more coal. The ruler of Germany may have to please the Greens, buts it‚Äôs a fool‚Äôs play and will result in great economic harm.

 If photovoltaic electricity was less costly than grid supplied electricity, photovoltaics would be used to make photovoltaics.
 If corn to ethanol made sense, ethanol would be used to fuel the process.

 If cellulose to ethanol made sense, cellulose would be used to fuel the process.

When you try to close the loop things become more obvious.   Closing the loop is what might in the vernacular be called a ‚Äúbullshit detector‚Äù. These schemes are adult analogs of the childhood idea of the motor powering the generator powering the motor, the difference is they occur at great cost to society. These schemes often exploit price disparities in fuels and require huge subsidies and an a studied ignorance to prevail.
It‚Äôs somehow very difficult to grasp the fact that a dollar is just a trading unit of energy and productivity is simply a measure of the ratio of human energy expended to useful energy returned.

It seems that the right knows that alternative energy isn‚Äôt profitable and the left doesn‚Äôt realize that it has to be, otherwise more energy is required than returned.

Farmers have learned to use solar energy profitably. Maybe we can learn something from them.",,,,
Solar Energy,Solar Energy:  Is CSP (concentrated solar power) dying?,"No, CSP can deliver power at night so it should be compared to gas (at 8 cents per kWh in the US, more elsewhere), and CSP is cheaper at 6 cents per kWh. It is more expensive than daytime solar (PV) which is now 3 cents per kWh, but we need electricity at night too. CSP is more needed now than a few years go because now we have days covered with PV, now we need a ‚Äònight solar‚Äô. It is about 10 times cheaper and 40 years more durable than batteries to build the thermal energy storage that enables CSP to deliver night solar. That‚Äôs not to say we don‚Äôt need batteries too. We need batteries for a few seconds to 1 hour or so of storage, but CSP for 1 hour to 12 hours of storage.",https://www.quora.com/Solar-Energy-Is-CSP-concentrated-solar-power-dying,,,,,
Solar Energy,What are some simplest solar energy projects?,"There are several simple solar energy projects witch may be helpful for you. Some of those include : SUN TRACKING SOLAR PANELS :  This project tells a way for mounting of solar panels to receive maximum solar radiation. An active tracker system can be used while placing a panel on the shaft of a stepper rotating motor to orientate the panel at 90¬∞ to receive the maximum sunlight. A microprocessor is programmed and placed to give signals to the  IC  through the motor receives a rotation from 0 - 180¬∞ at equal intervals to track the sunlight. SOLAR POWERED IRRIGATION SYSTEM:  This system is used to irrigate the land and to control the supply of water by sensing the soil moisture contents in less rainfalling areas. This project can describe a way to achieve this by using a solar powered pump, to overcome the frequent shutting down of grid supply and controlling the pump motor based on the sensor input signal which senses the moisture contents in the soil.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-simplest-solar-energy-projects,,,,,
Solar Energy,What are some things that use solar energy?,"Every living thing is using solar energy. we all know that solar energy creates heat, and with photovoltaics can create electricity directly, but it also allows for plants to grow. It drives the wind we used to use for sailing ships, and that wind at sea makes waves, takes sea water mist that becomes water vapor, rises to form clouds on the solar air currents and the winds drive those clouds across the earth‚Äôs surface, some of which comes to us on land. Precipitation as snow and rain gives us both snowmelt on mountains that become rivers, hydropower and irrigation for the solar energized plants we eat directly or through animal meat second or third hand. Plant matter from long ago became the fossil fuels we use, and while such hydrocarbons accumulated many poisons and other pollutants on their long way to becoming fuel for our gas cookers, power plants and petroleum transport fuels, they all could not have occurred at all but for solar energy. It is just a matter of how long ago that energy was produced. The longer ago it was formed into fuel, the dirtier it got. But for a century after coal was first used for power it was used in amounts that probably would not have mattered, as forests in other parts of the world lay down new plant matter that would eventually turn into replacement in the earth. Sadly for our present life and its future being comfortable, the use of those fuels just kept growing, and replacing more sustainable sources of energy. Did you know that for much of the century after steamships were developed, it was sailing ships that still carried the products that did not need fast transport? Sailing ships even filled the coal bunkers in remote ports that the passenger steamers needed. Some of the last of the longer transport routes more economic for non-perishable goods were the Guano carriers taking fertilizer from Chile to Europe around Cape Horne. That is a long way to go for a load of batshit, but it made a profit one hundred years ago, using solar driven wind power. So the world you see around you today is not at all the world we had even 100 years ago.

Solar Energy,What's the best way to invest in solar energy?,"Unlike many industries solar is indeed one of the biggest game changers in decades, and it would certainly be a shame not to seize the opportunity. But many industries, it depends on the amount of money you are ready to invest, and the level of risk you are ready to take. I won't be able to provide an exhaustive answer as I would need more details about your investment objectives etc. but basically it goes like this: If you'are looking for a small investment with a decent return and quite a low risk (provided you get it installed by a reliable professional), I'd advise to start by installing solar panels on your roof. Of course the amount you can invest is quite limited and that will never make you a millionaire. If you want to increase your size yieldcos are for you indeed. You can also ""buy"" solar panels for others (cloudsolar does that for instance). Now maybe you wan't to increase your target. For something medium risk / medium returns, try corporates with listed shares, either in the US, Asia, or even Germany. If you don't know which one to choose, you can try an ETF that invests solely in solar companies. I would advise to go for companies with a clear long term strategy. Ideally they would be in the process or planning to be fully integrated (from ingot to panels, including project development). I could digress and tell you why it is mandatory for a company to survive but that would be another discussion. Sundison and SolarCity are very different but somehow would do the job. Of course those are already quite large companies, so even if they might prove extremely profitable, they probably won't return 100 times your investment in 10 years. So if you're willing to make very big bucks and are ready do take high risks maybe you should consider investing in a startup. I wouldn't go for a startup promising a major breakthrough as it would certainly prove almost impossible to deploy (and hence to scale). Here again I could digress as to why it is the case, but once again it would probably be a discussion as a whole. Maybe try something offering a new kind of service or a new way to reach customers (it might be as simple as targeting an untapped country) hope it helped",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-invest-in-solar-energy,"Thanks for your answer, David.

Solar Energy,"Apart from batteries, what are the most promising ways of storing solar energy?","Basically anything that can store any energy can store solar energy (or electricity). There are a bunch of storage technologies. These can be usually classified into: 1. Chemical storage
2. Mechanical storage
3. Thermal storage Batteries are chemical storage devices. So are fossil fuels (stored by the wonderful Mother Nature for us to use millions of years ago). We could store energy by converting co2 and water into methane, methanol or ethanol using appropriate catalysts and energy (or electricity) or naturally using plants or genetically engineered algae or bacteria. We could simply perform electrolysis of water and get hydrogen and oxygen. All of the above are chemical storage options of energy or electricity. Mechanical storage devices are further classified into
a) potential energy based storage
B) kinetic energy storage.  Dams are the most popular potential energy storage systems, you can pump back water up the dam and generate electricity by converting the dropping water into electricity. Others included lifting heavy objects high and using a generator to do the reverse. Ice stored on mountains is an example of natural potential energy storage. My personal favorite however is flywheel storage. This is essentially a very strong disk rotated very fast in vaccum. Made with the right materials these can have extremely high weight and volume energy density. This is a kinetic energy storage device.  Examples of thermal storage is storing molten salt in a thermal solar plant to generate electricity overnight.  The primary choice of energy storage will depend on what the use would be. For moving vehicles, fuel based storage or battery storage may be the best options. For small and large static storage, flywheel seems to be a great option. For really large scale applications, dams or flywheels could work really well. For long term storage, fuel or potential energy storage might be a great. Other factors to consider are:
1. environmental impact: Batteries seem to be the worst in the long term, and flywheel storage could possibly be the best.
2. Technological maturity: Dams and Batteries are possible most mature technologies. Other storage options are still being developed  for better conversion efficiencies, cheaper and scalable manufacturing processes or lower energy losses.",https://www.quora.com/Apart-from-batteries-what-are-the-most-promising-ways-of-storing-solar-energy,"I'd reccomened ditching ""wind is a natural example of kinetic energy storage."" it is illogicial (maybe you could argue for it but it would take some doing and is unnecessary for your point)",,,,
Solar Energy,Will solar panels become more efficient in a trend similar to Moore's Law?,"No, at least they haven't yet. Efficiency gains in solar have been very slow. You can see the trend here: A bit messy, but efficiency has basically doubled in the past 40 years. Will it accelerate? I hope so. But it sure doesn't look like an exponential curve.   What is more interesting, and more relevant than efficiency, is cost. Cost has been dropping like a rock during that same time period.

Fake News,Are tabloids fake news?,"QAA:‚ÄùAre tabloids fake news?‚Äù No, tabloids are not fake news. However some tabloids have no doubt contained some ‚Äòfake news‚Äô items. And on occasions they have been successfully sued over stories they have published.  Dr. Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation . The definition of ‚ÄòTabloids‚Äô is that they are ‚Äúa type of popular newspaper with small pages that has many pictures and short, simple reports‚Äù  tabloid Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary From these short, simple, often insubstantial stories with oversized headlines, intended to catch the eye of a potential buyer of the paper as they were passing a newstand, we get ‚Äòtabloid journalism‚Äô.  Tabloid journalism - Wikipedia . These days I would suggest that the term ‚Äòtabloids‚Äô rather that referring the the size or the publication refers more often to ‚Äòtabloid journalism‚Äô and is generally used in a derogatory context. One of the most famous UK tabloid stories was ‚ÄúFreddie Starr ate my hampster.‚Äù  Freddie Starr - Wikipedia . The story itself amounted in an unsubstantiated claim by just one person and it would appear that no effort was made to verify any of the alleged facts. In the absence of any evidence the headline would appear to be entirely misleading. Furthermore it seems entirely reasonable to suggest that the paper the editor and the reporter all knew that the headline was misleading. And yet, while some people would say this intentionally misleading headline and the unsubstantiated allegation, amount to ‚Äòfake‚Äô news, the story is not ‚Äòfake news‚Äô. I believe the papers defence of the story would be that they were accurately report the alleged claim itself and that the paper was not itself claiming that the event occurred. If, however, the story had contained a false claim by the paper, for example that the reporter had been shown a half eaten hampster, or if the reporter had falsely claimed to have confirmed the story with Mr Starr, then the story would correctly be identified as fake news. Personally I think the problem with associating the terms ‚Äòtabloid‚Äô or ‚Äòtabloid journalism‚Äô with ‚Äòfake news‚Äô is that it suggests that a tabloid story such as the above example is ‚Äòfake news.‚Äô I would maintain that such tabloid stories have not quite descended to the depths of ‚Äòfake news‚Äô. Rather such stories remain at the bottom, in terms of quality, of what can be described as ‚Äònews‚Äô. To associated ‚Äòfake news‚Äô with poor or lower quality journalism in my opinion inappropriate. ‚ÄòFake news‚Äô should not be considered part of the spectrum of news output. ‚ÄòFake news‚Äô is a lie, a falsehood, a deliberated attempt to deceive, presented as news.",https://www.quora.com/Are-tabloids-fake-news,,,,,

Fake News,"Why do people believe that CNN, NYT, etc. are ‚Äúfake news‚Äù?","There are interesting answers that address this question directly  William Lawyer  listing instances (I haven‚Äôt checked these).
Also the question is answered indirectly by  Marty Conomos  bringing mission critical information to the table (a must read). For myself, I intend to deliver ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô.
Effectively, outlining the core reasoning for fake news, by providing historic examples. My thinking is‚Ä¶ that by placing ‚Äòtime‚Äô between the reader and the event‚Ä¶ the fake news can be considered from the viewpoint of the fake news generator. The two biggies, that most people will be aware of are: How did the USA manage to enter WWI and WWII, when the stated position was not to enter these wars. We understand that there was huge sums of money to be made - Britain finished paying back America in 2003!
‚Ä¶ but you only get paid if your debtor wins.
‚Ä¶ and there were even larger gains to be had, if America diminished the British Empire, and gained from all that would transpire. In WWI it was more directly related to money‚Ä¶ war loans that had been arranged by JP Morgan (initially $1.5 billion)
‚Ä¶ but America wanted to be at the top table when post war reorganisation occurred. Clearly, the stage was set for ‚Äòfake news‚Äô, and a strategy was determined: Aggravate the enemy Insulate the pawns from the knowledge of their forthcoming sacrifice Facilitate the enemy, to ensure that they would succeed I‚Äôll link a full report on the events at end
 ‚Ä¶ but for WWI - the Lusitania was chosen The Germans were allowed to be aware that it was loaded with munitions (contrary to neutral nation rules). The passengers were insulated from this knowledge. The ship was ordered to run at 75% speed, and as it entered U boat territory, the British Destroyer escort was called off‚Ä¶ facilitating an easy kill for the U boats. 1200 people killed, including 128 Americans.
8 days later Congress voted another $1 billion to be sent to Britain and France, and by the end of the war this totalled $9.5 billion. Obviously the fake news was that this was just a dastardly German deed, and that the Lusitania was not carrying munitions - though the wreckage is full of munitions and the full story is now known. For WWII - Pearl harbour was chosen Japan had no independent fuel source, so America pressured the Dutch into cutting off it‚Äôs supply (forcing action).
They protected the Japanese spy (on Pearl Harbour) from arrest, ensuring he could report back to Japan unhindered. Fuel supplies were cut to pearl harbour, preventing patrols in the corridor that would be used by Japans fleet.
Merchant shipping was directed away from that same corridor to ensure that the Japanese fleet couldn‚Äôt be spotted (Vacant Seas Policy). The Red Cross were informed, though first aid was supplied in secret, and positioned on the other side of the island, as were many nurses.
The most modern warships were deployed to a safe area. This left the chosen remaining fleet for sacrifice (mostly outdated ships).
Pearl Harbour could obviously have been alerted to the attack at least a day earlier, but that was not the plan.
Instead they received the alert 6 hours after the attack. 2,388 people killed, another 1,178 wounded. Lieutenant Commander Joseph Rochefort, head of the Navy‚Äôs Mid-Pacific Radio Intelligence Network said: ‚ÄúIt was a pretty cheap price to pay for unifying the country.‚Äù https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/freedomforce/pdf/futurecalling3.pdf  Everybody is aware of these deceits now.
Perhaps the modern generation looks back at these sacrifices, and believe that they were made out of necessity. The news that was published was ‚Äòfake‚Äô‚Ä¶ but it had to be, because of the objectives. So when Donald Rumsfeld told Politicians in January 2001 that America needed to organise a ‚Äònew Pearl Harbour‚Äô - it was clear what must be done.
This had already been outlined in their document:
Project for the New American Century - Rebuilding America‚Äôs Defences
 (The video starts at this point and includes Rumsfeld‚Äôs testimony - but the whole video is worth watching)  So when 9/11 happened ‚Ä¶ everybody was flagged up and prepared.
That included the news broadcasters, who went along with the charade. The only difference is that we didn‚Äôt need to wait decades to discover that this was the ‚Äònew pearl harbour‚Äô event.
The whole project was quickly debunked by the entire engineering community. But what was clear was that the news agencies played ball ‚Ä¶ with reporters aware in advance that the buildings were coming down‚Ä¶ building 7 (the third tower)‚Ä¶ even the Police were told the building was going to be demolished‚Ä¶ the BBC famously announced its destruction 20 minutes before the explosives were detonated!!!!
We all witnessed a perfect ‚Äòsymmetrical, imploding, demolition‚Äô, and we heard the charges being set off. No news organisation has ever retracted their coverage.
Sure‚Ä¶ you could argue that they were bamboozled just like the rest of us‚Ä¶ but there is too much evidence to show that they were complicit from the outset. Further‚Ä¶ when nobody could find the crashed airliner at Shanksville‚Ä¶ the press went along with the madness‚Ä¶ to the extent of reporting that the ground had opened up and swallowed the plane (???????) This was a degree of madness that surpasses all previous fake news statements.
It makes Donald Trump‚Äôs claim of ‚Äòhaving a larger audience‚Äô sound entirely acceptable. On top of all that‚Ä¶ the CGI video construction of 9/11 was maybe reasonable for 2001‚Ä¶ but even then it wasn‚Äôt great‚Ä¶ it could have been a lot better than it was.
All the TV news channels have teams of video experts.
How long would it take them to see the fakery? Like a demolition expert watching Building 7 come down‚Ä¶ they would know pretty much instantly (if they had not already been made aware in advance).  WWI - WWII - The Afghanistan War In this new century‚Ä¶ it is easy to understand the need for a new pearl harbour. It succeeded in galvanising America and the world.
Trillions were poured into the defence industry, and all those that wished, managed to give their armies live experience of war, to counter the forthcoming military build up by China. Of course you might disagree with this policy, but that is not the question here. The question here is ‚Äòwhy the fake news?‚Äô
Why do the broadcasters go along with it?
Why do politicians from all sides go along with it? It‚Äôs because fake news is normal.
It‚Äôs been with us since mankind began to talk and organise power structures. It probably all started with the first religions - fantastic fake news, that gave the leaders total power over the uninformed. The difference now, is that we have the means to discover the truth.
Engineers, physicists, architects (the educated class) can use the internet to debunk fake news. The other difference is that after 9/11, it became clear to all politicians and their advisors, that you could say pretty much anything, and the plebs would believe you. 9/11 let the fake news genie out of the bottle‚Ä¶ and it is now impossible to put it back.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-believe-that-CNN-NYT-etc-are-‚Äúfake-news‚Äù,Wow.

Fake News,How can anyone say CNN is not fake news?,"I can, because I worked there. For almost 20 years. Many of those people I worked with were some of the finest journalists you could find. Is it the same as when I was there? No, it‚Äôs not. We used to run actual  stories , not just have panels sitting around opining. But look at the makeup of those panels. They try pretty hard to include Republicans, like Steve Shmidt, Michael Steele, Bill Kristol, even Hugh Hewitt. Not to mention people who would never reveal their party registration but that you  know  are quite conservative‚Äî members of the justice department, former prosecutors and former State Department employees. Guess what? They are pretty much stating the very same thing. That the White House is in chaos, and the man running it is completely unsuited for it. Sorry (not really) if you think that amounts to ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù It‚Äôs not. And upholding our Democracy is very important, in the face of leadership that tries to issue executive orders taking away birthright citizenship and the like.",https://www.quora.com/How-can-anyone-say-CNN-is-not-fake-news,"Let me add a little more perspective to the answer. Unfortunately it is true that there are more panel discussions and opinion sharing than news production. Candidly that‚Äôs because they‚Äôre easier and cheaper to produce. However, when it comes to actual news stories based on sound journalism, CNN does present fact-based reporting. The problem is that there is a mixture of ‚Äòreal‚Äô news, next to analyses that are supposed to provide perspective based on facts and, finally, opinions which in my opinion are of little value. Several research projects and surveys show that many people can not differentiate between the three and therein lies the problem. Until all of the major mainstream media address that problem more forthrightly and more clearly, it will continue to be a problem.",Well said you pointed out some good points. CNN s panels Got old a few years back. Not.news just opinions and talking points. The Sunday talk shows have stacked their guest list w conservatives or gop types f years. Gets boring and biased. Not just CNN but all of them are playing info tainment game pretending to be journalism. Oh well there are so many other options for one to access. The ad revenue business model may be big part of the reason f the decline. CNN still does some serious docu-reports that have lots of facts. One can learn from them. Enjoy those with friends as we get into good discussions. You stated it well that things have changed since your time in industry. Best wishes in beautiful Sedona area.,"I agree with Kathie McDonald, I watch CNN, MSNBC, NBC, etc I do not see fake news, they report what is said by Donald Trump and the White House. If it weren‚Äôt for those News Outlets we would never hear the truth. Fox is a huge propaganda network. They cut out the bad, rarely have a Democrat as a guest, if they do they don‚Äôt allow them to talk and they have Donald Trump as a guest and let him lie to the public without correction. The only fault I find with CNN; when Trump is in front of the cameras they stop everything to show him. Why? Trump never has any substance in his comments, he is arrogant and dishonest. CNN is not fake news, they have been treated horribly by Donald Trump and the only fake in the mix is Donald Trump.","The old saying that facts are inconvenient things applies here. It comes down to this: the stories that appear on CNN are verifiable, most easily, and the verifying of those facts before putting them on air forms the foundation of the standards the organization has devoted itself to since Ted Turner founded the network. With organizations like Fox, quite simply, the case is exactly the opposite.","Have the majority of Americans never heard of ‚Äúsourcing‚Äù? Why would anyone ever take anything that any news agencies puts forth as a story as being solid? Every news story is a journalists interpretation of the facts, but they are not specialists in those areas. Take science for example. If there's a news story with a scientific basis, who gives a shit what the journalists interpretation is? They are journalists, not scientists. They took a university program where you can identify classrooms by the way they smell like stale alcohol and jizz. They did not take the thousand times harder science program. SO CHECK THE SOURCES. You have to source things. I don't give a flying fuck what ‚ÄúBilly-Bob‚Äù thinks about some scientific report. I care what Dr. Soandso and Dr. Whosit and Dr. Someone and Dr. Whosthat and Dr‚Ä¶ said about it. Fuck Billy-Bob's interpretation of what these far more qualified people said. Read what those people said. It's not fucking rocket science guys‚Ä¶"
Fake News,Does fake news qualify as 'free speech'?,"In a purely theoretical sense, any speech is ‚Äúfree‚Äù and people should be able to say whatever they want (though never in any sense are people protected from the normal reactions to their speech). In reality, free speech is people‚Äôs right to be protected from restraint and censure  by the government,  particularly if they criticize the government. And also in reality, the fact is that what people say can sometimes be very injurious to the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of others, so in that case, no protection is extended to it and they are held accountable for the consequences. There are always people who try to play the system for their own benefit regardless of what it does to anyone else. For example, Alex Jones spread conspiracy theories about the Newtown massacre to the point that parents who had already lost their children to that atrocity had to fear for their lives and live in seclusion. Jones claimed free speech (then temporary insanity when forced to give a deposition) but  it‚Äôs not going well for him in the courts. The purveyors of fake news make a profit doing so. Too bone lazy to actually work, I guess. They claim that fake news falls under free speech protections, but that simply is not a clear-cut case. Legal Realities of Fake News and Its Consequences Given the American appetite for fake news, this problem is not going away any time soon. It‚Äôs infiltrated our social media, affected our elections, and inflamed violence around the world. It‚Äôs not really a problem for liberals. In fact, it wouldn‚Äôt exist if conservatives didn‚Äôt create the market for it. ‚ÄúWhen we were coming up with headlines it's always kind of about the red meat. Trump really got into the red meat. He knew who his base was. He knew how to feed them a constant diet of this red meat. ‚ÄúWe've tried to do similar things to liberals. It just has never worked, it never takes off. You'll get debunked within the first two comments and then the whole thing just kind of fizzles out.‚Äù We Tracked Down A Fake-News Creator In The Suburbs.

Crypto Currency,"What crypto wallet do you use, and why?","A Bitcoin wallet is a place that stores your digital Bitcoin and validates your transactions when you're using your Bitcoin. A wallet keeps secret information, called private key or a seed which is used to validate transactions and ‚Äúsign‚Äù them so that your Bitcoin can be used to make purchases or exchanged for another asset. This prevents someone else from using your Bitcoin or the transaction being altered by a third-party. Often when people refer to a Bitcoin wallet they are actually referring to a crypto exchange that offers a wallet as part of their account features. In this sense, the wallet is just the place where all of your cryptocurrencies are kept, or where you can keep fiat money for future use. Prices go up, prices go down -- but Bitcoin is here to stay. And as cryptocurrency continues its march toward the mainstream, and becomes more entwined with the global economy, sooner or later you're going to need a place to store yours.

Solar Energy,Can solar energy become cheaper than conventional sources of energy?,"For small loads in remote locations it already is. Many of the emergency telephones on the sides of highways in the US are solar-powered. Am I assuming that you are talking about residential rooftop deployment or utility-scale deployment? Basic research (at least the publish research...) tends to be academic. The Intellectual Property then needs to be licensed to a company that will use the IP. They will only license the IP if it will get them a competitive advantage in the marketplace, and to do that requires that power generators believe that they can get a contract long enough to recoup their investment  for an form of energy that is inherently intermittent. There are brokerage companies who will purchase and distribute renewable power to people who want to consume all renewable energy often for more money than the legacy generators. But each state is different.
Storage of energy, which is still expensive as AC electricity doesn't store directly, is probably the limiting factor to further use of highly-variables renewables unless we can get residential users to allow the grid operator to turn off a large person of their loads in case supplemental non-baseload generation drops. Many utilities already have a similar program but I think they only turn off the AC and then only for a few hours at most.

The chief limiting factor in slowing down solar adoption (and limiting useful capture energy) is the light density per sq m which falls down a lot in northern countries and temperature cycling for tropical and equatorial inner continental places (day/night temp difference can be in excess of 25C). The last one is remoteness, and the requirement to build new infrastructure for such locations, but that is more of a logistical/political problem than a technical one.

Solar Energy,What are good ways to make the solar energy cheaper?,"Dr. Harish Hande might show you how: There is a striking link between poverty alleviation and sustainable  energy. Sustainable energy is a critical tool for addressing the  inequality in energy access and consumption, and acts as a catalyst in  promoting income generation and regional peace. Provision of sustainable  energy is imperative to socio-economic growth and development. As  financing is the key to proliferation of off-grid renewable energy  systems, there is a need to address the lack of innovation in meeting  the customized and longer term financing needs of low-income households.  A critical issue is that existing trends are not focusing on building a  sustainable long-term investment climate to support an energy  revolution. This lecture examines the lessons learnt from other sectors  that can be replicated to increase access to electricity, and details  which instruments can be used to promote entrepreneurship for a  sustainable energy future for all.

Solar Energy,What are some alternatives to solar energy?,"Question: What are some alternatives to solar energy? I am going to assume that the context of the question is electric power generation. One of the current alternatives to solar energy exists using fossil fuels for conventional thermal electricity production. We like solar energy options because they are quiet and clean. Also, the sunlight and heat there to use each day for free. There are many ‚Äúrenewable‚Äù energy alternatives available beyond solar. I refer to hydro, land and sea-based wind power, ocean tidal/ wave power, hydrogen, concentrating solar thermal (CST) and geothermal power plants that also benefit the planet by being clean energy producers and producing no CO2 during their operation. A CST power station uses thousands of mirrors to reflect a large area of radiant heat in sunlight onto a central location. There are renewable energy alternatives that include biomass and ethanol, but when these burn is producing CO2 during use. Nuclear power is an established power technology that is used across the world, albeit in many countries there are political objections to it being introduced more widely. However, nuclear also has its advantages: 1. It is an efficient electricity production technology and has been successfully used in many countries in place of fossil fuel (oil, gas and coal) alternates. 2. It does not pollute the atmosphere with CO2 during electricity production. Much of the contention of nuclear power has to do with the effective safe disposal of nuclear waste.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-alternatives-to-solar-energy,"RE:  Much of the contention of nuclear power has to do with the effective safe disposal of nuclear waste. Radwaste disposal is a political problem, not an engineering problem.","hydrogen is not renewable, it is made from fossil fuels. It can be made from water using renewable energy, but then it is not an energy source, just a means of energy storage.","Nuclear ""waste"" is not a problem. 95% of it can be consumed in modern reactors like breeders or molten salt reactors. During operation the fuel pellets eventually become sufficiently contaminated with byproducts of the fission that they need to be removed. The rods containing the pellets are stored underwater in huge pools for up to eight years, at which time their radiation output has decreased to the point that they can be safely stored in concrete cylinders outside of the plant. These are valuable assets that can be used as fuel. For more on this topic with images download the free PDF of Unintended Consequences the Lie That Killed Millions and Accelerated Climate Change from  And The Tundra Cub  or from  https://tinyurl.com/yas7x2ok .","Yes, and it is most ironical that ‚ÄúMuch of the contention of nuclear power has to do with the effective safe disposal of nuclear waste.‚Äù The nuclear power industry is the only heavy industry yet to fully account for its waste and fund its disposal. Most of the waste is spent fuel, which is particularly well researched and we have three good technologies for handling it.","I must reply to one of the assumptions made. Biomass fueled thermo generation is considered a carbon neutral power source if the fuel is procured as an alternative to landfilling, as a byproduct of logging or to lower the unacceptabel level of the fuel load in our wildlands and forests. It is statements like the one made that have made it hard to site these units."
Solar Energy,How do I get into solar energy business in Maharashtra?,"Be an Uber for Solar! So, here's a theoretical Business Plan for setting up a company, which provides Solar PV Systems on Lease, yielding good returns  upwards of 20%  in the long run. In cities like Pune, where there is a large construction boom, there are plenty of newly constructed buildings/projects. Most of them have very high electrical consumption primarily due to operations of  Sewage Water Treatment Plants, Lifts/Elevators and Pumps (for pumping water to the Overhead Water Tank). The monthly electrical bills go into lakhs of rupees, as they are charged very high tariffs for excess consumption. The actual cost of electricity on a per unit basis is derived to be between INR 15-20/unit after all the various charges and taxes. (Yes, I have confirmed this after studying bills of various buildings) Recently, the government of Maharashtra has approved a Net Metering Policy (like many other State Governments) whereby these buildings/societies can set up native Solar PV Systems on their premises/rooftops and provide electricity back to the Grid. This will help reduce their net consumption of electricity and thus they will save on their bills. The catch is that Solar PV Systems are expensive to set up and these buildings/societies can ill afford a large capital expenditure like that. That is where YOU can step in with your company, where you set up the Solar PV System, lease it and charge the consumers on a per unit basis for a period of 15 years, resulting in net savings for the consumers and an excellent return on your investment in the long term. Here is the theoretical Business Model for setting up a 1KW Solar PV System.   As you can see, the savings for consumers & returns on your investment are excellent considering a 15 year life period for this system. The returns will only increase depending on the capacity of the system due to Economies of Scale. In today's market, it will not be difficult to find large foreign investors willing to provide the capital required to set up a company like this. All you need is ability to market the sell the system.  The demand is there and growing, but are YOU up for the challenge?",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-into-solar-energy-business-in-Maharashtra-2,But this is only for those large construction boom cities where tariff is actually abave 15 INR/Unit.

Solar Energy,What are the different types of technologies for production of solar energy?,"There are two main types of solar energy technologies‚Äîphotovoltaics (PV) and concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP).

Solar Energy,What are the future prospects of solar energy?,"This depends upon storage. Solar energy is wonderful when the sun shines high overhead. It is not very good when the sun is very low in the sky. Solar energy is useless at night. Another issue with solar energy is that it is hard to turn off. As long as solar is a very small percentage of our total electricity supply this does not matter. We can turn off something else when we have too much supply. However, if solar energy becomes our primary source of electricity, turning it off when supply exceeds demand is important. If we had infinite storage, then solar would be wonderful. We do not have infinite storage. In areas reasonably close to the equator, we need enough storage to go for 24 hours. In locations further away from the equator, this is not nearly enough. Consider a community in Alaska that is powered entirely by solar electricity. In the winter, they get almost no sunshine. It would take a huge amount of solar cells to created enough electricity. In the summer Alaska has very long sunny days. The amount of electricity that these solar cells would generate would be huge. We have to do something with the excess power. We cannot just wish it out of existence. It has to go somewhere. If it does not go anywhere else, then it will go into melting our entire electrical grid. This means that in locations that are a long way from the equator if we wanted to get all of our electricity from solar power, then we might need a full year worth of storage or a completely different source of electricity. It seems very unlikely that a full year worth of storage is going to happen. Solar could be quite a bit more of our electricity source. However, there is one other problem with it: It is only practical if we have another source that can be turned on and turned off quickly. Fossil fuels can be turned on and off quickly. This means that if we want to get 1/3 of our electricity from solar and 2/3 from fossil fuels then solar is wonderful. With better storage we could probably get this closer to 50% solar and 50% from fossil fuels. If we had only a moderate amount of storage, then hydro electric power can also be turned on and off quickly enough. However, there are not enough locations in the US to locate new hydro electric facilities to serve as the largest source of electricity for the US. Nuclear power plants take a long time to turn on and to turn off. If we want to completely do away with using fossil fuels to generate electricity, then solar has issues. It is not clear what other reasonable options there are however. In the short run it appears that dramatic increases in our storage capabilities plus some increased use of solar makes sense. In the long run it looks like this cannot get us away from using fossil fuels to generate quite a bit of our electric power. If anyone thinks that we can get 100% of our electricity from solar and nothing from any other source, then they are not looking at the entire problem. It is also clear that we really do not know enough to fully predict what our power sources will look like in 50 or 100 years. We just have not been able to come up with a realistic alternative to using fossil fuels to generate at least quite a bit of our electricity.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-future-prospects-of-solar-energy,"Nobody needs infinite storage! We need enough storage and that‚Äôs starting to happen. Storage is starting to replace gas peaking. (The storage plants are actually being built, and a couple are up & running) Solar PV is killing Nuclear & coal (because it shifts base load time to mid day and drops base load further and further with time) Solar PV + wind is reducing gas use. Solar PV + Wind + Storage is replacing gas peaking and frequency regulation. (it‚Äôs cheaper) As storage expands (and it will/is - the projects are in the pipeline) the gas use will reduce even further. ‚ÄúWe just have not been able to come up with a realistic alternative to using fossil fuels to generate at least quite a bit of our electricity.‚Äù Nope - we have and we are!","‚ÄúAnother issue with solar energy is that it is hard to turn off.‚Äù Try turning off a nuclear plant!!!! Also try turning off a coal plant!!! For both economic reasons and technical reasons these are very hard to turn off. With coal it takes too much energy to turn them back on and with nuclear it takes too long to cool them down. Nuclear also saves almost nothing on fuel by being idle. Actually if you literally turn off a Nuclear plant you get Fukushima. The reason you have gas peaking in coal/nuclear dominated grids is because a coal or nuclear plant does not cope well with changing output too fast or too much. And I‚Äôve just had a pro-nuclear person try to tell me I was not understanding something because a Nuclear plant takes days to turn off and they pretended I had said otherwise!!! It‚Äôs really fun on Quora because facts are cherry picked and misused to claim that Nuclear & coal are necessary. Even their limitations are used to try and claim dominance over anyone who points to their demise if it scores a point (incorrectly usually) Solar PV is not hard to turn down or off. Solar farms are not only able to be turned off but asked to do so if there is a capacity issue with over-supply or not sufficient transmission capacity. It‚Äôs called curtailment. Solar Rooftop generally has not been able to be turned off because there has not previously been a protocol in place to signal to the many installations. There are now standards for signalling rooftop systems to reduce output. But of course the better approach is to store the excess generation, and to shut down the fossil fuel plants.",,,

Fake News,"Did Facebook's ""fake news stories"" have a large influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election?","I first wrote about Facebook‚Äôs potential to swing elections in May of 2016. I had no idea how frighteningly accurate my prediction would be. While we still don‚Äôt have all the facts, it‚Äôs clear that Russian operatives gamed Facebook to swing the election to Trump. - Could Mark Zuckerberg decide the presidential election? The media‚Äôs been abuzz over a  report  this week claiming that Facebook staffers blocked conservative news stories from the site. Facebook denies the report. But it‚Äôs worth considering the growing role Facebook has in shaping public opinion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand whether it could use its enormous power to swing elections.  Around 200 million people in the US use Facebook every month, for an average of 50 minutes a day. It‚Äôs what  Parag Khanna calls a ‚Äústateless superpower‚Äù.  It‚Äôs where we get our news, share our personal opinions and political views. It‚Äôs also becoming a place where politicians are spending more time & money. The site‚Äôs rich demographic data lets politicians target prospective voters with highly personalized messages.  Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù, introduced in 2014, show up in a section to the right of the main newsfeed. The feature uses an algorithm to identify and promote topics in major media outlets that people are buzzing about. The topics are personalized to each user based on their ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù & location.  According to a  recent blog post , the company has a system involving both software formulas and humans to ensure stories displayed in ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù aren‚Äôt biased. Justin Osofsky, Facebook VP of Global Operations (and my former McKinsey colleague), says ‚ÄúWe have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum‚Ä¶ Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin.‚Äù  Does Facebook have a political agenda? Most companies do. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to  publicly denounce Donald Trump  at last month‚Äôs annual F8 developer conference: ‚ÄúI hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as ‚Äòothers.‚Äô I hear them calling for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, for reducing trade, and in some cases even for cutting access to the internet.‚Äù  Facebook employees understand the political power they wield. In  an internal poll  on what questions they want Zuckerberg to answer at the next Q&A, one question was ‚ÄúWhat responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?‚Äù  Internal Facebook poll Facebook has no legal responsibility to provide an unbiased view of what‚Äôs happening on its network. Just as the New York Times has a First Amendment right to block or promote any content it wants, so can Facebook. It can decide which candidates to cover, and whether to show them in a positive or negative light. It‚Äôs not that different from how a newspaper editor decides which stories to run in large type on the front page. There‚Äôs one key difference, though. Facebook keeps its formulas secret, just as Google doesn‚Äôt release the algorithms that underlie its ubiquitous search engine. What these companies do with their algorithms can have profound effects.  In 2010  Facebook ran an experiment  with 61 million people to see how it could impact real-world voting behavior. According to one study, Facebook increased voter turnout by more than 340,000 people, simply by showing users a photo of someone they knew saying ‚ÄúI voted‚Äù. When I visited Facebook‚Äôs headquarters last summer, one theme I heard repeatedly was ‚ÄúFacebook tries to ship love‚Äù. They understand the power they have to shape users‚Äô emotions. It‚Äôs one of the keys to their success.  Nearly 80% of online American adults use Facebook. More people get their news from it than any other source. The company‚Äôs influence in politics & elections is unprecedented in the history of media. If it wanted to, it could almost certainly skew a national election toward one candidate. The same could be said for Google. I‚Äôm not saying this is happening now or is likely to happen in the future. But it should give us pause to consider: What if Facebook decided to remove any pro-Trump media coverage from its site? The damage it could do to a politician who relies so heavily on mass media would be ‚Äúyuge‚Äù. Companies have always used their power to sway elections, in the form of campaign contributions, ads, lobbying, bribery, etc. But no company has ever held so much influence while providing such minimal transparency into its operations.  I love Facebook. I was one of its original users back in 2004 when ‚Äúthefacebook‚Äù was available only to Harvard students. I use it every day. The idea of a tech company using its engineering savvy to destroy Trump may sound quite appealing to many people. But we should be cautious about where we‚Äôre heading. Is there a way to make companies like Google and Facebook accountable and transparent on how their software shapes public opinion? Or do we risk letting elections be decided by a handful of Silicon Valley CEOs?

Fake News,What are the biggest lies or fake news to ever come out of Fox News?,"Fox News has a couple of journalists in the middle of the day that no one watches that actually cover news. Chris Wallace is on them. Most of their shows, however, are opinion and entertainment. Their most watched shows are notoriously biased and misleading like fox and friends, Hannity, and Laura Ingraham. Fox and Friends talked about Trump‚Äôs tax returns that showed he lost more money than anyone in America as some kind of brilliance on Trump‚Äôs part and a great achievement. They also would bring up how a cold day means climate change is not real and they do that frequently which is completely false. They also use incredibly misleading language like ‚Äúthe democrats believe the great human right that transcends all others is the right to kill your own babies through abortion."" Ainsley Earhardt responds by telling Jeffress he is ""so important to our country. ... We love you."" how that constitutes as news is beyond me it‚Äôs more like propaganda. A study was done following a years nightly news coverage of abortion and it found 94% of the coverage came from Fox and the other 6% came from CNN and MSNBC. The statements from Fox about abortion were wrong 85% of the time. They made statements like ‚Äúinfanticide and late 4th trimester abortion were actual progressive policy goals‚Äù, ‚Äúyou will not see a doctor unless you are having an abortion at planned parenthood‚Äù and the group advocates for ‚Äúinfanticide and late term abortion‚Äù. This is part of a thing they do to make Democratic policies sound extreme and crazy by taking things out of context and using selective buzzwords to make their point which is always the same, democrats are bad! Another favorite topic of Fox and Friends is immigration. Their favorite buzzword is ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù and they are adamant about it. They started every morning off one week by covering a distant caravan of Central American immigrants who were fleeing gang violence and poverty by calling on the military to ‚Äúprotect our sovereignty by any means necessary‚Äù. These were families who were walking and were over a thousand miles away. This was in the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections and Trump was parroting the same talking point. The day after they started making these comments a gunman killed 11 worshippers in Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh because he believed the Jews were helping the ‚Äúinvasion caravan‚Äù from Central America‚Äù. Guess where he got his news? If you guessed Fox you‚Äôre right! A few months later a gunman in El Paso killed 20 people in a WalMart to stop the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of Hispanics in America. This gunman made sure to put in his manifesto not to blame Trump though‚Ä¶. Did they directly make people go on murder sprees? No but did they help by describing immigrants as bloodthirsty invaders? They certainly did. I can understand being against illegal immigration but comparing it to an invasion is not news. That‚Äôs propaganda meant to inspire fear. Fox likes to say Democrats are coming for your guns and if the news attacks Trump then you can be next. They use a narrative of conservative victimhood to promote an us vs. them mentality that has added to a bad polarization problem in the US. They describe democrats as a hostile group that wants to take away their rights, undermine their values and cause them harm. These are propaganda tactics, not informative news coverage. While I disagree with what Fox does, they are effective at it and the anger and resentment they pump out becomes part of their viewers identity and they start to close their minds to any information that doesn‚Äôt agree with their Fox hosts opinions. They also cover some really fake stories and say they are real. Pizza gate was supposedly a pizza parlor in DC that Hillary Clinton and Co were running a pedophile ring out of the basement. This was of course not true but they put that out there and a gunman went there and tried to kill people to free the non existent children from the non existent basement. They also covered a story about Seth Rich who was a DNC staffer who was killed in a botched robbery. They claimed he was killed by Hillary Clinton. They retracted it later but once that was put out there, there‚Äôs no taking it back from the conspiracy theory believers. Fox is so far from News it‚Äôs not even a serious question. I have family members who I don‚Äôt even talk to anymore because they have been sucked into the Trump loving Fox craziness.

Fake News,What action should media outlets take to combat fake news?,"There are (at least) two problems that give rise to the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù phenomenon. But let me pause for a minute first to define how I‚Äôm using the term for the purposes of this answer. I‚Äôm not talking about biased news, or errors made by major publications, nor even irresponsible publication practices taken by what ought to be responsible publications. We‚Äôll get to that, as you‚Äôll see, but those aren‚Äôt themselves ‚Äúfake news‚Äù in the technical sense. Fake news is ‚Äònews‚Äô put forward fraudulently by people just working the system at publications that aren‚Äôt really news organizations. It can either be politically motivated and well-funded (in some cases perhaps by state-level actors) or it can just be spam. This news has catchy headlines and juicy stories but has absolutely zero concern for the truth, nor usually any concern for appearing truthful other than for just long enough to trick some poor sap into sharing it. What gives rise to that? First is the ‚Äòdistribution‚Äô problem - and this is something that Facebook and Twitter and others are struggling to deal with. I think progress will be made here, just as progress has been made against spam e-mail. Second is the one I‚Äôm more interested in. And that‚Äôs that various problems with traditional media have given rise to a real loss of trust, and this has given rise to the plausibility and gullibility. In short, when we get biased news, frequent errors, clickbait headlines, an extreme race to publish first (whether a story is confirmed or not) then the public doesn‚Äôt know who to trust or what counts as real. What‚Äôs the solution to that? At  WikiTribune  what I‚Äôm really putting forward is a strong ethos that we must  show our work . If we have an interview, we should to the maximum degree possible post the audio and the transcript. If we have quotes from a source, we should to the maximum degree possible name the person we are quoting. If we have documents, we should to the maximum degree possible publish the documents. Not everyone will read all that background material, of course. But it will be there for a community of people who are interested in holding truth as a core value to read and to edit our work to improve it, in case someone has gone beyond what the source said, or written in a biased manner, etc. Now I do want to add that in some cases, that kind of ultimate transparency isn‚Äôt possible. Sometimes you do need to protect a whistleblower. But even in those cases, there should be processes and procedures that are transparent and reasonable and verifiable and publicly signed off on to make sure that such things are being done in a responsible way. If more media outlets take this approach, then the public understanding of what ‚Äúcounts‚Äù as real news will shift. Just looking like a newspaper masthead won‚Äôt be enough - people will expect to see the source documentation just a click away.",https://quorasessionwithjimmywales.quora.com/What-action-should-media-outlets-take-to-combat-fake-news,"The problem isn‚Äôt that the mainstream media makes mistakes; of course they do.

So ‚Äúfake news‚Äù IS biased news, and deliberately faked news made by major publications and news organization that ought to be responsible, and are not.

One simply can‚Äôt get to an understanding of any public issue because the media mission is to influence rather than to inform.","Nail. Head. I recently e-mailed Lessig about some, if not most of these observations. You‚Äôve put it much better than I could ever have written. The very essence of what I felt like writing Lessig about was simply: When, in the vein of ‚Äúpublish first,‚Äù a major news-media outlet abridges details (i.e. political spin, or for attention-grabbing headlines) ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre happy to publish hyperlinks to minor details, while hyperlinks to the important information are often neglected.

Solar Energy,What are the new developments in solar energy?,"Power is the most paramount ingredient of infrastructure for growth in economics and welfare of a nation. Development for sustaining the growth of the Indian economy in the existing infrastructure is crucial. The power sector of India is one of the largest expanded power sectors in the world. Due to the continuous increment in electricity demand day-by-day, Indian power sector is interfacing some challenges to maintain the balance between the power generation and demand with suffering from supply constraints and shortages in power. For maintaining the ratio of generation and demand of power, moving from conventional sources to non-conventional sources is not only an option, it is a necessity. The importance of using solar as an energy source in India◊≥s perspectives in not only to increase power generation, but also to expand energy reliability with considering the environmental, social, independent and financial beneficial properties. This paper analyzes the recent scenario, strategies, availability, future potential, policies and development of solar energy in emerging Indian power sector.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-new-developments-in-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,Why should people consider solar energy?,"1.Save lots of money! Immediately after installation, you might notice a big dip in your electricity bills. The major advantage of having solar power at home is that you can save on monthly electricity costs. A joint study by policy and research group CEEW and power distribution company BYPL concluded that installing rooftop panels can save up to 95% of your monthly electricity bills. Switching to solar electricity, aids in decreasing your dependence on the grid based electricity because the solar panels directly allow you to generate electricity with the help of the sun. Reducing electricity costs will,in turn, help you in increasing your savings significantly. Thus, a solar power system ensures year-round service, efficiency, and savings. If you have an off-grid setup, then you can completely eliminate all your electricity costs. 2.Increase your property value Did you know that installing solar panels can also increase your property value by 3-4%? Equipping your home with a solar energy system drives up property values and offers an attractive selling point for real estate agents to market your property. Research conducted in the USshowed that homeowners with solar power systems not only regain the initial cost of their solar systems when they sell, but they also receive a premium that will increase the return on their investment. 3.Freedom from centralized grids Once you go solar, you automatically decrease your dependency on centralized private or government grids. In a climate of increasing demand and inconsistent supply, going independent is the safest and most sustainable bet in the long run. Solar power provides a secure future investment. Adding a battery backup to your solar power system will provide you with additional independence. In such a case, you would now not only be generating your own power but also storing it for use when the main grid fails. This will give you total energy independence. 4.Contributing to a better environment Even though fossil fuel-generated electricity is convenient, it is disastrous for the environment. By adopting solar rooftop systems, you have invested in a green and renewable energy source which is beneficial for the environment. Solar power is completely clean, it produces no air pollution, no water pollution, and no greenhouse gas effects. It is also carbon-free, no harmful emissions are released when electricity is being produced by solar panels. It also reduces the need for finite resources. You can now enjoy your renewable, clean power every day continuously guilt-free! 5.It is not that costly Yes, the initial cost of installation can be high, however, government schemes and subsidies exist that provide rebates to help with the initial cost. Also remember that these costs are one-time.  Solar panel systems  are extremely durable and require little to no maintenance over their productive lifetime, which can span 25 years or more. Solar systems are also extremely easy to maintain. The main maintenance that these panels require is an occasional dusting to remove dirt, leaves, or any other fragments. One can always call a professional, to clean these panels once in a while. Solar power is the most popular type of alternate electricity source that can be easily installed in your home. It is a reliable and sustainable power resource that when channelized can run any and every device in your home. There has never been a better time to invest in solar energy, with the national and international agencies committed to promoting solar power, providing subsidies, and setting renewable energy targets for India and the world. Because of its economic and environmental benefits, homeowners investing in solar power is the most sustainable solution for all your electricity concerns.

Solar Energy,How is solar energy harmful to the environment?,"Solar energy reduces harmful emissions caused by the burning of fossil fuels and improves the health of those around you for years to come. Some of the key environmental benefits of solar are as follows: Less Water Usage Solar panels do not require water to function, while conventional electricity sources use tens of thousands of liters of water every year. The power sector in India mainly utilize plants for cooling generations, processing/refining fuel, and transporting fuel through pipes. 2. Mitigates air pollution Fossil fuels generate harmful gasses like methane and carbon dioxide which reduce the air quality. Air pollution can hinder our health and well-being by causing anxiety, headaches, pneumonia, heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and allergies. Solar energy dramatically reduces carbon emissions in the air you breathe, which improves your overall health. 3. Slows down climate change The burning of fossil fuels increases the presence of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere that contributes to the enhanced greenhouse effect which is warming our planet faster than before. The consequent increase in global temperature results in the melting of glaciers, rising sea levels, which in turn causes a number of calamities like cyclones, frequent floods, extreme heat, and drought. On the other hand, generating electricity from solar panels does not produce any greenhouse gases and therefore helps to slow down climate change. 4. Lowers consumption of fossil fuels We have always largely depended on coal, oil, and natural gas for our energy needs. Fossil fuels are finite in nature and cannot keep up with the increasing demand for energy and are major contributors to pollution. Solar energy, on the other hand, is abundant and can be endlessly harnessed to meet global energy consumption, reduce energy costs and ensure a stable energy future. 5. Reduces carbon footprint The term ‚Äòcarbon footprint‚Äô is used to account for the release of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere by human activity. The major contributor to carbon footprint is the use of fossil fuels. Alternatively, solar energy is one of the cleanest forms of energy. For every 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of solar energy produced, 0.5 to 1 ton of carbon dioxide is offset. If you are planning to go solar, ZunRoof is here to assist you in every way.

Solar Energy,What is the source of solar energy?,"There are two main theories for solar energy. 1920s nuclear fusion model 1970s electric sun model..   I do not support the gravity model as it has several fatal flaws. The Electric Sun has been experimentally tested and is well on the way to completion. We await the final measurements from ESA‚Äôs probe over the next two years.    So I am only discussing electricity as our energy source. This means that stars do not produce any energy themselves they merely act as ‚Äòtransformers‚Äô. Their job is simply to convert high energy electrons from the galaxy into useful electromagnetic radiation (light, heat, etc). In the 5 year SAFIRE project the input energy was actually amplified by the plasma discharge. This bodes well for supporting the Renewable Energy industry. Watch the recent SAFIRE update video and a second commercial benefit has emerged from the project.    Transmutation of elements has been demonstrated and measured. This has always been suspected as it is seen in the behaviour of stars (and laboratory plasma tests). Again the nuclear power industry may benefit from a recycling process using the solar plasma principle.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-source-of-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,Is solar energy a non-starter?,"It's not a non-starter, but it does face significant obstacles to becoming mainstream:  It's a challenger in markets dominated by entrenched, politically powerful, subsidized incumbents. It's tough to make inroads in monopoly markets when incumbents enjoy subsidies and powerful lobbying organizations.  Yes, in some states it's the law that if you put PV on your house, you have to pay your utility for the privilege. Price has come down to the point that Solar PV is (over the life of the system) cheaper than paying utility rates, but that's only true if you don't have to borrow (and thus add interest to your total cost).  Because the distribution of cost over time is all front-loaded with solar, financing becomes necessary for many. This means not everyone can 'go solar' now. Its transient nature (sun goes behind clouds, it's dark at night) will eventually require grid support for load-buffering (think: temporary storage) in order to really take full advantage of it.  This adds costs, and the most-sensible places for this sort of infrastructure mean cost and utility don't align. Utilities will resist this. The grid really is engineered around central-production and can't deal gracefully with distributed generation, especially of the peaky, transient sort.  Our grid was engineered with pre-1950's technology, and 'good enough' is the enemy of 'better'.

Solar Energy,How is chemical engineering related to solar energy?,"It is a common mistake to suppose that solar power means photoelectric. Solar energy can be converted into useful work using heat energy. One application is the solar still to convert salty water into drinking water, which can be done on an individual scale or larger. The heat of the sun can be used to vaporize a low-boiling liquid and the expansion produced can produce useful work such as pumping or driving motors. Concentrating with a reflector can produce higher temperatures suitable for solar cookers, which have great environmental advantages and can help poor people near the equator. Concentrating can also give a high enough temperature to raise steam, which can do useful work and even be stored. The first solar-power plant is reckoned to be that by  Frank Shuman  in Egypt, which drove a 60 hp motor pumping water.

This was ousted by the coal and oil industries. A later attempt to bring it back in the 1970‚Äôs was overcome by pressure from the electronics industry to sell its photoelectric cells. So all of this involves heat transfer, mass and energy balances, often fluid flow, just the sort of thing for chemical engineers.

Solar Energy,What will it take for solar energy to become our primary source of energy?,"Intermittent renewable generating technologies (i.e. wind and solar) are causing havoc with electric grid operations because these technologies cannot be controlled by the operators of the electricity grid due to the fact that their generation depends on the wind blowing and the sun shining. Thus, the independent system operator in charge of running the grid must be ready to either drive down the generation of traditional technologies (i.e. natural gas and coal) when intermittent renewable generating capacity starts producing power or ramp up generation from more reliable technologies when intermittent renewable generating capacity shuts down. This means that the independent system operator needs an arsenal of flexible generating technologies to come to the rescue in order for electric consumers to receive electricity at the touch of a switch as they have been accustomed to. Some countries, such as Germany, have built such a great deal of intermittent renewable generating capacity that their traditional generating technologies are not bringing in enough revenue to survive, which means either consumers will need to make adjustments regarding how they use electricity or government regulators will need to make adjustments regarding how electricity is priced to pay for the flexibility needed. Regardless, electric customers should expect changes in the future‚Äîeither in price or in availability of electricity‚Äîor both‚Äîto deal with the increased advent of intermittent renewable generation. IER has discussed this issue with respect to wind power whose construction largely preceded solar power due to its lower cost. But, now system operators are preparing for the advent of increased solar power and its potential havoc on the grid, including solar on residential rooftops and businesses. Description of California‚Äôs ‚ÄòDuck Curve‚Äô The California Independent System Operator (ISO) has developed a ‚Äòduck curve‚Äô to describe how massive amounts of customer-sited photovoltaic systems could cause problems to the state‚Äôs supply-demand balance on its electricity grid. It provides a scenario of a sunny day where distributed photovoltaic generation pulls down non-solar electricity demand to extremely low levels at midday when the sun is at its hottest and distributed photovoltaic generation is at a high. That is, the state‚Äôs non-solar generating capacities must reduce their production to inefficient lows when the energy supply at the ‚Äúbelly‚Äù of the duck from solar distributed generation is at its highest. (See graph below.) Later in the day when solar generation is declining and California residents are coming home from work and turning on their appliances, electricity demand ramps up dramatically, which requires flexible generation capacity to come on-line very quickly to meet it. The California ISO is worried that the ‚Äúneck‚Äù of the duck curve could overwhelm the state‚Äôs available generating capacity. More specifically, the figure shows a net load curve for the March 31 for years 2012 through 2020. This curve shows the megawatts the system operator must follow on the y axis over the different hours of the day shown on the x axis. There are several distinct ramp periods. A ramp in the downward direction occurs after the sun comes up around 7:00 a.m. when on-line conventional generation is replaced by solar generation (producing the belly of the duck). As the sun sets starting around 4:00 p.m., and solar generation ends, the system operator must dispatch resources that can meet the most significant daily ramp (the arch of the duck‚Äôs neck). Immediately following this steep 13,000 megawatt ramp up, as demand on the system deceases into the evening hours, the system operator must reduce or shut down generation to meet the downward ramp.

Solar Energy,Why is solar power the future of India?,"India as well as other countries like china and even the very very sunny UAE plan a mix of renewables and nuclear. Without expensive energy storage wind and solar can be built quickly and baseload plants like coal can be retired - up to a point. Without huge amounts of storage you rely on the grid for backup. If lots of baseload coal plants are replaced by wind and solar AND you get to the point that the number of baseload plant gigawatts is below the amount of power demand, you start to run the risk of widespread blackouts. You either need storage or natural gas peaker plants. So just like everywhere else, solar and wind will continue to grow QUICKLY until it reaches the point I mentioned above.

Crypto Currency,What are crypto currencies you are bullish on for the next bull run?,"In my previous answer, I was most bullish on IOTA, Nano, Cardano and Elastos and Skycoin.  Marius Kramer's answer to What are crypto currencies you are bullish on for the next bull run? However, now after further research, I need to revise my position a little bit. I explained that IOTA, Nano, Cardano, Elastos, Skycoin are the only coins that have the potential to replace Bitcoin, because they are the only ones that offer Near infinite scalability. That means they are able to process at least millions of transactions per second and possibly also billions. Near infinite decentralisation. This means that their voting should be distributed over at least 10,000 to 100,000 different voters.

That means, they CANNOT be PoW, because PoW suffers from strong mining pool centralization, so the coting is pretty muchc distributed across only 3 voters. They cannot be PoS, because PoS suffers from strong centralization of voting power among the rich, large companies, institutions, governments, thus defeating the whole point of the blockchain. They can also not be dPoS, because dPoS is only distributed across a few dozen nodes. Low energy usage. Currently with around 50M users, Bitcoin uses 30TWh per year, around the electricity of a small country like Ireland. All banks together use around 100 TWh per year. With 5B users, Bitcoin would use 3,000 TWh per year, 300 times more than all banks combined, making it completely unusable as a global currency.  The Bitcoin vs Visa Electricity Consumption Fallacy . This automatically disqualifies all PoW coins (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Digibyte, Verge) Near instant transactions. That means, that transactions should be confirmed within 3 seconds maximum. 10 seconds is already too much. Imagine, every person needs to wait 10 seconds at the register for the payment to confirm. This would add much overhead and a lot of lost revenue to any retailer or super market. Permissionlessness and trustlessness. Permissionless means that there is no 3rd party making rules how to vote, thus giving permission. Trustlessness means that nodes do not need to trust each other in order to participate in the voting. This is not given for Ripple, Stellar, EOS, NEO, Ark, Lisk. They are all permissioned and non-trustless, which always leads to cartel formation, lobbyism and introduces a myriad of social engineering attack vectors such as blackmail, coercion, threats etc. Zero Fees. Having fees is still suboptimal, but it is not such a big point compared to the above 5 Ethereum also has a good chance to be in this group with their coming implementation of Casper, Raiden, Plasma and Sharding. Now, you‚Äôre asking, what will their market caps be? Currently we have Ethereum at $47B Cardano a $4.5B IOTA at $2.7B Nano at $322M Elastos at $90M Skycoin at $60M All of them have the technology to replace Bitcoin. In fact, these 6 are the only ones that would be able to replace Bitcoin. Bitcoin is currently at a $132M market cap and will also most likely go back to $20,000 or a market cap of $400B before these altcoins start overtaking it. That means that these altcoins also will reach a $400B market cap and possibly more in the next bull run, which is probably coming end of 2018 or early 2019. A $1T market cap of the replacement of Bitcoin is definitely possibly within the next year. This would lead to the following investment returns. Ethereum from $47B to $1T = 21x Cardano from $4.5B to $1T = 222x IOTA from $2.7B to $1T = 370x Nano from $322M to $1T = 3,150x Elastos from $90M to $1T = 11,111x Skycoin from $60M to $1T = 16,666x However, in reality, the number one spot will probably be shared by at least 3 of these coins, so that the market caps will be something like this Ethereum from $47B to $300B = 7x Cardano from $4.5B to $300B = 70x IOTA from $2.7B to $300B = 108x Nano from $322M to $300B = 920x Elastos from $90M to $300B = 3,000x Skycoin from $60M to $100B = 1,666x Now, lets get to my research. This is what i found upon deeper investigation. Nano :
Yesterday, I made this post in  r/nanocurrency - How does Nano's dPoS compare to other dPoS such as Eos, Neo, Ark?  and it turns out that Nano‚Äôs dPoS is just like any other dPoS, which is permissioned and non-trustless. This isn‚Äôt good. I don‚Äôt even see why Nano uses this algorithm, they could use a modification of PoW like IOTA and be permissionless and trustless again. Hopefully, Nano will decide for a change in their consensus algorithm, because they are using the same one as EOS and we all know that EOS‚Äôs algorithm is utter cr*p. Cardano:
Cardano is using a modification of generic PoS, which always leads to centralization towards the rich and powerful in its generic form. In its consensus algorithm Ouroboros, smaller coin owners can band together and stake against large coin owners together, thus preventing centralization towards the rich and powerful. However, this entails staking pools, which leads to centralization again and introduces a single point of failure, where an attacker could take over a staking pool. Hopefully, Cardano realizes this and makes a change. There is a way to prevent their algorithm to be vulnerable to that. Skycoin:
 Skycoin‚Äôs price has suffered a lot due to the kidnapping and erratic behaviour by their leadership. They are using a Trump-style marketing strategy to respond to criticism. This works with some people, but most will stay away from this coin, because of that. IOTA, Elastos and Ethereum: I have not found any noteworthy criticism about these, so these are my top 3 right now Conclusion From these 6, I don‚Äôt think Nano will be among this group. They do have the technology, but their platform doesn‚Äôt offer any of the features that the others offer, such as Smart Contracts, Dapps, ICO launch platform and more. These are very essential in the crypto sphere currently and without them, it‚Äôs unlikely to be able to compete for the number 1 spot. Furthermore, Nano has the flawed dPoS algorithm still. Cardano seems better than Nano, but it also has a pool centralization in its consensus algorithm. Elastos also offers the most comprehensive dapp runtime environment, followed closely by Cardano. Skycoin will also take longer to achieve this level, since they want to completely replace ISPs and this simply takes time. As for Ethereum, IOTA, Elastos, they all seem to have the same chances. Ethereum isn‚Äôt there yet with its technology, though they have an advantage in terms of branding, awareness and adoption already. IOTA comes from a different angle. They do not offer dapps yet, but they have a very fast and unique technology with their Tangle, which is the fastest among all the below 3 platforms. In terms of investing, I would allocate funds this way 10% into Ethereum from $21B to $300B = 15x 45% into IOTA from $1.6B to $300B = 190x 45% into Elastos from $62M to $300B = 4,900x Please give an upvote if you found this post helpful & share it with your friends! :)",https://www.quora.com/What-are-crypto-currencies-you-are-bullish-on-for-the-next-bull-run,You are forgetting Tezos.

Fake News,Why is Fox News not considered fake news?,"Bare with me until the end because I am making a point. Quora is 95% Liberal. Its a ‚ÄúFeel-Good‚Äù place where like-minded ppl can come and try to validate their perception of reality. I guess you could call it a virtual ‚Äúsafe place‚Äù and confidence building spot. For these 95%‚Äôers - receiving ‚Äúupvotes‚Äù and reassuring comments from other 95%ers is absolute confirmatiom for them being right. This also gives them the confidence to openly condemn everyone else who doesn‚Äôt agree - no matter how little evidence presented, or how irrational the info may sound. My point is that it‚Äôs very simular with Fox News and Conservative Talk Radio for Conservatives. And CNN, MSNBC and the other Left Leaning News Outlets for Liberals. I remember the days when News was nothing more than just News, and it was so much easier for Americans to know where they stood when it came to politics! I remember the majority of Americans were pretty much down the middle - and no one hated anyone due to their political party or political leanings! So what happened? Did the Republicans shift too far to the Right? Or did the Democrats shift too far to the Left? I have my own opinions on this - however a much bigger issue I see is it‚Äôs nearly impossible for the Americans actually seeking ‚ÄúTruth‚Äù are out of luck!

Fake News,"Is Alex Jones ""Fake News""?","No. Alex Jones is not NEWS. Look, words mean things. Fake News is a term used to describe disinformation published in a news format. In the early part of the 2010s, the rise of sharing links on social media media and affiliate marketing created a giant 2-headed monster. Disinformation moved from e-mail spam to Social Media Junk. Emails that concluded with ‚ÄúFORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK!!!!‚Äù became Social Media posts that said, ‚ÄúSHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE ON YOUR FRIENDS LIST!‚Äù The disinformation evolved as well, rather than an email formatted message about a Nigerian Prince who just wanted to move his money to a US bank and needed help to do it, the disinformation started to take the format of News stories on websites formatted to look like News Websites. The bullshit evolved as well. Where the Email scams were meant to make fools respond, even just to collect their email address, the Fake News sites wrote sensational headlines meant to capture a clickthrough that would generate ad impressions. It became a cottage industry in Macedonia.  The Macedonian teens learned something early a truth that has been confirmed in study after study:  Extremely conservative Facebook Users are by FAR the most susceptible to sensational fake news, especially when the headlines designed to make them happy. ‚ÄúITS FINALLY HAPPENING, HILLARY IS REALLY GOING TO JAIL THIS TIME!!!!‚Äù is NOT an extreme example. That was a normal and very effective example of a Fake News headline.  The page you landed on would have a story formatted like a news story with a bunch of bullshit in it about ‚Äúnew information about emails‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew evidence on Benghazi‚Äù etc, etc, etc, and two other things would crowd the page. Links and snippets of other similar stories to get the user to click further in, and Affiliate marketing Ads such as Google AdSense  The other head of the monster was Content. The Macedonian Teens were great at cloning WordPress websites and Copying and Pasting, but not writing. The good, well done, effective content started elsewhere. Most of that came from the Internet Research Agency, headquartered at 55 Savushkina Street in St Petersberg, Russia.   The Internet Research Agency masterfully wrote content designed to sow distrust, discord, and chaos among the American electorate, did a masterful job using a giant array of fake accounts to spread the disinformation, in and of itself building a massive undertow, especially among American Conservatives of distrust and malice toward American institutions, like the media, Higher Education, government agencies, certain sectors of the free market like pharmaceutical companies, social organizations, and built up big-name Boogey-Monsters, like George Soros and Bill Gates. No Boogey-Monster received more attention from the Agency than Hillary Clinton. The Macedonian kids weren‚Äôt after discord and chaos like the Internet Research Agency was, they were after profit, but the stuff the Agency was publishing was almost guaranteed to catch, so they copied and pasted in droves. A flood of links appeared across social media feeds across the internet, all LOOKING like reputable news sites, they were well designed, with clean lines, used sharp imagery, and names designed to draw in the conservatives like ‚ÄúConservative News Weekly Dot Com.‚Äù As the 2016 election came close, the problem that the flood of fake news across social media was causing started to become apparent, and social media companies started to take notice of the problem. Too late, they started to work on blocking sites that were not verifiable news agencies and the accounts that shared the links. That part of the damage had been done, but as the later part of 2016 came around, the actual media was heavily covering the problem of ‚ÄúFake News on Social Media.‚Äù The term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù entered the zeitgeist. Then Donald Trump did something that did  real  damage. He co-opted the term and started using it to refer to real news organizations that didn‚Äôt provide him with positive coverage. Anyone who criticized him. His base fell RIGHT in line. Such an easy thing, such an easy dismissal. They didn‚Äôt have to fact check, they didn‚Äôt have to look any further, that was ‚ÄúFake News.‚Äù Except, no. It wasn‚Äôt. It was real news, written by professional journalists adhering to the Society of Professional Journalist‚Äôs strict Code of Ethics.  But how EASY it was for the Trumpists to dismiss. Those people hated Trump, so obviously, anything they said about him was made up. In fact, any fact-checking site that corrected anyone saying positive things about Trump was obviously ‚ÄúFake News‚Äù as well. The Demonization of fact-checking began. Every source you could use to validate something was suddenly ‚Äúleftist.‚Äù Except, no. It wasn‚Äôt. This is just how well the Internet Research Agency did their job, and how well Trump and his allies took advantage of the distrust and discord sewn. Getting back to the question at hand. No. Fake News is News Written in a News Format that is not factual in nature, does not conform to the SPJ‚Äôs standard of Ethics and in general, is made up out of whole cloth. Alex Jones isn‚Äôt news at all. He‚Äôs a talk show host. He doesn‚Äôt purport to be a journalist, he runs a talk show which may as well be called ‚ÄúConspiracy Theory Stew‚Äù and uses the platform to make millions selling snake oil supplements and other crap.

They may label their totalitarian fantasy ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù, but it bears no resemblance to the genuine article, which they would destroy if they could.

Fake News,What is the best fake news you have ever read?,"Came across this one recently.  (Cameron Harris works in his home office in Annapolis, Md.) Cameron Harris, a new college graduate with a fervent interest in Maryland Republican politics and a  need for cash , sat down at the kitchen table in his apartment to fill in the details Mr. Trump had left out. In a dubious art just coming into its prime, this bogus story would be his masterpiece. Mr. Harris started by crafting the headline:  ‚ÄúBREAKING: ‚ÄòTens of thousands‚Äô of fraudulent Clinton votes found in Ohio warehouse.‚Äù  It made sense, he figured, to locate this shocking discovery in the very city and state where Mr. Trump had highlighted his  ‚Äúrigged‚Äù  meme. Harris created a fake story about an electrical worker who stumbled upon stacked boxes of ballots marked for Hillary Clinton. It was eventually shared with 6 million people. ‚ÄúI had a theory when I sat down to write it,‚Äù recalled Mr. Harris, a 23-year-old former college quarterback and fraternity leader. ‚ÄúGiven the severe distrust of the media among Trump supporters, anything that parroted Trump‚Äôs talking points people would click. Trump was saying ‚Äòrigged election, rigged election.‚Äô People were predisposed to believe  Hillary Clinton  could not win except by cheating.‚Äù Mr. Harris and his ersatz-news website,  ChristianTimesNewspaper.com , make for an illuminating tale.
Contacted by a reporter who had discovered an electronic clue that revealed his  secret authorship of  http://ChristianTimesNewspaper.com , he was wary at first, chagrined to be unmasked. ‚ÄúThis topic is rather sensitive,‚Äù Mr. Harris said, noting that he was trying to build a political consulting business and needed to protect his reputation. But eventually he agreed to tell the story of his foray into fake news, a very part-time gig that he calculated paid him about $1,000 an hour in web advertising revenue. He seemed to regard his experience with a combination of guilt about having spread falsehoods and pride at doing it so skillfully. **Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the fake article on Mr. Harris‚Äôs website.  At his kitchen table that night in September, Mr. Harris wondered: Who might have found these fraudulent Clinton ballots? So he invented ‚ÄúRandall Prince, a Columbus-area electrical worker.‚Äù This Everyman, a ‚ÄúTrump supporter ‚Äù  whose name hinted at a sort of nobility, had entered a little-used back room at the warehouse and stumbled upon stacked boxes of ballots pre-marked for Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Harris decided. ‚ÄúNo one really goes in this building. It‚Äôs mainly used for short-term storage by a commercial plumber,‚Äù Prince said. In case anyone missed the significance of the find, Mr. Harris made it plain: ‚ÄúWhat he found could allegedly be evidence of a massive operation designed to deliver Clinton the crucial swing state.‚Äù A photograph, he thought, would help erase doubts about his yarn. With a quick Google image search for ‚Äúballot boxes,‚Äù he landed on a shot of a balding fellow standing behind black plastic boxes that helpfully had ‚ÄúBallot Box‚Äù labels. The article explained that ‚Äú the Clinton campaign‚Äôs likely goal was to slip the fake ballot boxes in with the real ballot boxes when they went to official election judges on November 8th .‚Äù Then Mr. Harris added a touch of breathlessness. He pushed the button and the story was launched on Sept. 30, blazing across the web like some kind of counterfeit comet. ‚ÄúEven before I posted it, I knew it would take off,‚Äù Mr. Harris recalled. He was correct.
 The ballot box story, promoted by a half-dozen Facebook pages Mr. Harris had created for the purpose, flew around the web, fueled by indignant comments from people who were certain that Mrs. Clinton was going to cheat Mr. Trump of victory and who welcomed the proof. It was eventually shared with six million people, according to CrowdTangle, which tracks web audiences. Within a few days, the story, which had taken him 15 minutes to concoct, had earned him about $5,000. That was a sizable share of the $22,000 an accounting statement shows he made during the presidential campaign from ads for shoes, hair gel and web design that Google had placed on his site. But after the news was found to be untrue, the ads on Mr. Harris‚Äôs website were gone. He checked with the appraiser and was told that the domain was now essentially worthless. Asked whether he felt any guilt at having spread lies about a presidential candidate, Mr. Harris grew thoughtful. But he took refuge in the notion that politics is by its nature replete with exaggerations, half-truths and outright whoppers, so he was hardly adding much to the sum total. ‚ÄúHardly anything a campaign or a candidate says is completely true,‚Äù he said. *BRAIN* SOURCE:  Log In - New York Times",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-fake-news-you-have-ever-read,,,,,
Fake News,Why does fake news spread so quickly?,"Because the fake news is being lapped up the media particularly the electronic media and also hugely by the social media Also the art of writing fake news has improved by leaps and bounds . In my opinion this is the outcome of greater use of What's app. And revenue for what's app comes from gathering of greater use of the media . Everytime a post is shared with another group the app is able to pick up the data of newer persons . And they sell the data to the highest bidder . They got posts written in such a manner that they were close to the reality but entirely made up . They were packed with lots of pathos and emotions . And they were topical to ensure reading and outburst of emotions leading the user to share the posts with greater number of groups. In between they also forwarded good jokes and sick jokes to keep the users thrilled. In between they used nationalism ,courage pride etc to keep the emotion and hurt content high . But every story was bogus . Then instead of coaxing the users to forward the messages they also used the idea of ‚Äò goodies' to lure larger numbers . Sometimes they threatened that if not forwarded then harm would follow . But all that has stopped now . Yet the posts continue to be designed to appeal to the heart of the readers so that forwarding continues unabated. I am not saying that social media app what's app is all bad . It's a very useful app if used intelligently and diligently . We in our family use it extensively and to our advantage. But for spread of fake news and to make it believable what's app and Facebook do lot of damage . Every one of us seems to believe the goody goody and emotional appeal of the ingeniously written posts . These posts reach a wide audience with hundreds of channels trying to capture the audience attention. Theres no time available with these broadcasters to double check the authncity . Political parties is a huge source of fake news to run down the opponents. They also use these expert writers to churn out fake news reports closely resembling the reality . The facility of morphing has led to creation of fake posts . But the overriding factor to sudden increase in fake news is that the supporters of one party are willing to believe anything derogatory about the other parties.

Crypto Currency,What does George Soros think about crypto currency and the block-chain?,"The general perception is to be dismissive towards the understanding and opinion of Baby Boomer towards innovative technologies. Soros precedes the baby boomer era, however he is arguably one of the best fund managers and has a sense of how technology shaped the global.

A high level of volatility make it impossible to use Bitcoin for everyday transactions. His view is that dictatorship, lack of faith in governments across the globe and tax evasion have kept them at the current levels and will not lead to a dramatic crash.

Fake News,Is The Corbett Report fake news?,"Let‚Äôs do two tests: An analysis using logic and a check on Media Bias Checker. Immediately, I am struck by two things: The poor design and the preponderance of Youtube videos. The site‚Äôs white but laid out in the manner of a poorly set up blog. Of the listed articles, none have any sort of description or preview of their text. Not something seen on even on more reliable independent sources. The articles are uh. Interesting. The videos on the cover seem to be hysterical in tone. (Montesanto!) That doesn‚Äôt look good, so let‚Äôs look on Media Bias Checker. Well, that answers my suspicions fairly well. It‚Äôs rated Conspiracy-Psuedo-science   . The level of factual reporting is rated as low. Right-leaning, too. Left-leaning loony blogs exist as well but wow. Fake news here! EDIT/UPDATE:
With the comment last night from Freddy Thornton, I decided to take a second look at Corbett Report. Well, I‚Äôll give it credit-the site‚Äôs layout updated and it looks a fair bit better, actually. So let me take a look at what he has posted. I honestly have no skin in this game, really. I don‚Äôt have any pre-formed opinion and it‚Äôs been months since I looked at this site and looked only briefly. Long enough that I‚Äôve forgotten what I‚Äôve seen and I am open to changing my mind as I type this. I am willing to admit I am wrong or made a snap judgment in error. So, to see if my initial opinion was sound, I will look at randomly-picked recent articles from his newsletter, as I retain text better than sound. Articles on the newsletter that I read through: 2017: Year of the Technocracy (12/30/17) Forget Russiagate, the REAL scandal is Israelgate! (12/17/18) How Big Oil Controls Environmentalism (10/08/17) The Bitcoin Psyops (09/30/17) Hate is a Racket: SPLC caught funneling Millions (9/03/17) The articles are‚Ä¶ very clickbaity. There‚Äôs a scanty few actual facts and a whole lot of opinion with not many reputable sources that inform it. It‚Äôs, as I had thought: psuedo-scientific conspiracy theory baloney. If this is what you think is true, please seek help and find other sources of news. I gave this a fair shot and all it did was make me ill, considering there‚Äôs people who believe this tripe. The main things I can find as his sources are garbage and other opinion blogs. Opinions aren‚Äôt facts. That‚Äôs why they are called opinions. They may be on facts of a matter but these opinions seem to be spun up from near whole cloth. And yes, you are correct that his political standing is hardly relevant. However, that is the leaning of his blog. It‚Äôs conservative. It is a statement of fact in describing the blog. Right wing is an accepted term in political science to refer to a larger grouping of political thought. ‚ÄúHe is a libertarian and anarchist.‚Äù Yes. The former is a CONSERVATIVE, right-wing ideology. He spouts garbage. This blog and Youtube channel are garbage.",https://www.quora.com/Is-The-Corbett-Report-fake-news,"Well, ain‚Äôt that a superficial analysis and entirely off the mark. As one who has followed James Corbett on youtube for many years I can say without a doubt that he is ahead of the curve in comparison to mainstream news media. For exacmple he was reporting on the Cambridge Analytica a couple of years ago foretelling of the present situation. Another thing about Mr Corbett that I appreciate is the fact that he cites his sources, something rarely seen with mainstream media who are constantly reporting the statements of ‚Äòunknown sources‚Äô often invovlving the government. While Jame‚Äôs politics leans toward the libertarian/anarchist perspective, I would not consider him right-leaning, especially since such a term is meant to be divisive. More importantly, what does his politics have to do with whether or not he is ‚Äòfake news‚Äô? It is a non-point. What about the politics of a Rachel Madow, or anyone on CNN? Both of which I would label fake news and propagandists of the government. ‚ÄúPoor design and preponderance of youtube videos.‚Äù-lol- what an asinine way of judging the validity of reportage. Did you even look at any of his videos? Probably not. If you are going to judge whether or not a journalist is ‚Äúfake‚Äù or not, you need to analyse the accuracy of their reportage. The fact that you did not is a clear indication that yours is a ‚Äòfake‚Äô analysis and of little value. While Mr Corbett does report on things that are not covered by mainstream, things that may cause one to question the trustworthiness of elected officials and the present state of government, his reporting is by far the one I trust more than most simply because he has yet to misrepresent the truth and he has been ahead of the curve reporting on that which the powers that be do not want you to know about. As for Media Bias Checker, I would not trust it anymore than I would trust Snopes. It is for the lazy minded who want to be told what to believe and not for the independent thinker capable of judging for themself. Relying on such a service is indicitive of how little you think for yourself.","Cassandra, liberarianism is NOT, absolutely NOT a conservative ideology.

I have a doctorate in law, I have practiced law for years and researched international law, affairs and history for 30 years, and I am happy to give Mr Corbett a thumbs up. So much of what he reveals tallies with my years of research on many subjects, and I assure you that I use my legal training to seek out the ‚Äúbest evidence‚Äù, and the best sources for history and international affairs.

Crypto Currency,What's the difference between crypto currencies and crypto assets?,"The fact that cryptocurrencies went from a very niche, esoteric and a sort of ‚Äòobscure‚Äô place to being an active part of the main discussion in a G20 meeting speaks miles about the power we as the common people have. Since the general public is easily swayed and frenzied by sensationalist news (take this question as an example), one has to being wondering when and if the whitewashing of the masses will ever stop. Governments around the world are trying to halt the spread of cryptos but their attempts seem to yield no tangible results: The more strings they pull, the more people talk and spread the good name of cryptocurrencies. To keep things short, while public perception may temporarily shift into a sort of negative perspective (if cryptos are not a currency, WHEN will we get to use them?!), I see the entire ruckus as nothing but another feeble attempt to stop the inevitable. The value of cryptos will grow exponentially, until the moment FIAT finally breathes its last throes, and at that point, when cryptos take over, we‚Äôll have long-term stability PLUS all the benefits a decentralized currency brings to the table.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-crypto-currencies-and-crypto-assets,,,,,
Solar Energy,Is solar energy better than electrical energy?,"Yes. Solar-powered electricity is better than the electricity from your utility in several ways. Solar-powered electricity is not polluting. It is a form of energy that does not contribute any CO2 to the atmosphere, so you are not contributing to the cause of climate change (power stations making electricity by burning coal or gas emit CO2, which is gradually creating a carbon dioxide ‚Äúblanket‚Äù over the earth, gradually trapping more heat, a process that will continue for centuries, harming our ability to live). Solar electricity is also far simpler and more efficient than electricity made by turning a huge turbine in a huge power station, which is how coal, nuclear and gas powered thermal energy power plants work, using the steam from boiling water to start a generator turning to make electricity. All electricity is essentially just electrons moving down a wire. In solar panels, the electrons are simply pushed at an atomic level, starting at the panel. Photons of light coming from the sun push the electrons out of the way, and continuing down the wire. So a solar panel is a radically simple straightforward way to make electricity.",https://www.quora.com/Is-solar-energy-better-than-electrical-energy,"‚Äú It is a form of energy that does not contribute any CO2 to the atmosphere, so you are not contributing to the cause of climate change ‚Äù Every source of energy emits CO2 into the atmosphere, so Im a little confused why you think solar is exempt.

Solar Energy,"If solar energy is inefficient, then how do solar energy organizations sell their products?","Efficiency is an interesting concept when you talk about renewable energy. Mostly, it‚Äôs meaningless except as input to a more useful economic discussion. Efficiency is a much greater factor for non-renewable energy sources because they have to pay for their fuel. Renewable sources don‚Äôt. The wind blows and the sun shines regardless of whether anyone puts up a solar or wind farm to capture it. The wind and sun are free resources. Efficiency is explicitly a measurement of how much of a given resource‚Äôs energy potential gets turned into electricity. With solar panels, this is around 20%, but the 80% isn‚Äôt an expensive waste. And 20% isn‚Äôt that bad actually. Car engines only turn about 20% of the energy in gas into movement, with the rest being waste heat. Coal plants achieve from 33% to 40% efficiency in the best cases, with the rest being just wasted heat. Combined cycle gas plants, where the heat is used in addition to the mechanical energy to generate electricity manage to make it up to about 54% efficiency. But all of those fossil fuel sources are paying for 100% of the fuel, and the negative externalities of the fuel are from 100% of it. In fact, CO2 emissions are two to three times the mass of the fuel inputs, so it‚Äôs arguable that we are paying for 300% of the fuel but only getting 20% to 50% out of it. Wind energy, coincidentally, has a theoretical maximum efficiency of 59.3%, known as the Betz‚Äô Limit. The best wind turbines reach about 95% of that, which is pretty awesome, but still isn‚Äôt that much different from a combined cycle gas plant. The wind is still free however. Solar and wind have another factor which is important for economics. While the wind and sun are free, they don‚Äôt blow all the time and aren‚Äôt always blowing or shining hard enough to make the wind farms and solar panels generate electricity at maximum potential. Over the course of a year, the ratio of actually generated electricity to potential maximum electricity is called the capacity factor. For solar, the capacity factor ranges from 15% to 25% depending on where you are located and whether the panels follow the sun on (more expensive) trackers or not. For modern wind farms, capacity factors range from 40% onshore to 77% one year for the best offshore site. And now the very flexible wind and solar farms are sometimes curtailed because the much less flexible nuclear and other baseload forms of generation can‚Äôt be turned down quickly even though they often have much worse economics in many cases. But even there, lots of legacy forms of generation have lower capacity factors. Nuclear is high at 90% because it can‚Äôt actually run at less than that capacity factor and pay for itself. Coal in the USA was at 60% or so a decade ago, but now it‚Äôs at 50% for the country because wind, solar and gas are cheaper so it can‚Äôt compete. Many gas plants are at 10% simply because they only turn them on to provide peak power at highest profit. So wind and solar don‚Äôt have to be efficient, they just have to run enough over the course of time to pay for their capital costs. Their marginal operating costs are dirt cheap, much cheaper than coal and gas plants. Efficiency being a problem is overrated.",https://www.quora.com/If-solar-energy-is-inefficient-then-how-do-solar-energy-organizations-sell-their-products,Have you considered bringing the concept of amortization into that discussion?

Thanks sir!","While wind and solar power generation in itself are clean, fossil fuels still carry the burden during the extraction of raw materials and manufacturing of the turbines and PVs.

Solar Energy,What are the best books to read if I'm interested in solar energy?,"Solar Power Your Home For Dummies: Edition 2  Is a great book, it is my top recommendation.

Stuff that was true in 2010 or 2014 is no longer true, the industry is changing rapidly. Your best bet is figure out what you need to know, talk to professional and get the required information. In 2006, when you installed panels, everything had to be perfect, every angle. People used to sue their neighbors over trees. Now companies are putting panels on the wrong side of the house, no worries about partial shading and dead cells, electronics will compensate. Over ordering panels and making the meter ‚Äúspin backwards‚Äù, this used to be a horrible thing. What allows companies to do these things, the electronics have gotten phenomenally better and cheaper. The panels have gotten so cheap they will still make money even in partial sun.

Solar Energy,Why has solar energy not become popular as an energy source?,"Mike  has covered  cost and intermittency  in detail, but I would like to add a few.
There are other factors involved in determing the uptake of solar are, cost being the main one: Purpose : All loads are not favourable to be dealt with solar. For example base loads are better catered by conventional generation sources while peak loads are more suited towards solar.  Since most of your load is base load you have significant power from conventional sources and mostly gas used for peak loads, due to its low ramp up time. But there are studies which have now started scheduling renewable energy for catering to base loads thus addressing the base load fallacy (http://www.energyscience.org.au/BP16%20BaseLoad.pdf). Given the rapid advancements in the solar technology it penetration is increasing at a very rapid rate. (http://theconversation.edu.au/renewable-energy-can-provide-baseload-power-heres-how-2221) Grid strength : The grid should be strong enough to take in large amounts of intermittent power. Currently grid in some countries cannot withstand too much procurement from renewable energy.  Storage :  With solar storage is another problem. Batteries increase the costs by nearly one third, given that solar is already so costly. Hydro has good storage capabilities. Land : This can be one of the biggest impediments with respect to solar (except rooftop).  Political factors:
Spain and Germany are examples where rapid solar uptakes have led to very high tariff impacts and hence a backlash. Learning from them, and with the costs falling so fast and energy security concerns, the governments have taken the necessary policy initiatives to support and promote solar in a big way esp in solar resource rich countries.  Solar scores very high points for life cycle use of other resources as compared to other sources.
 Environmental factors:
Low GHG and other pollutants
Low water usage (second to wind) Social factors :
Highest employment per megawatt
No waste or fuel related issues (big negative for nuclear)
No displacement problems (big negative for hydro) That said there is huge burgeoning interest in solar in the past decade.
Growth has been more than  40 times in installed capacity  and a similar trend for the investments.

  Source: http://www.pewenvironment.org/uploadedFiles/PEG/Publications/Report/G-20Report-LOWRes-FINAL.pdf  Future projections are expected to grow at a much faster rate (India 22 GW by 2022 and China 50GW by 2020) and you can see solar become 'popular' very soon.

Solar Energy,Why do many solar energy start-ups fail?,"Several solar panel manufacturers have gone out of business, but this isn't at all because solar in general is a bad idea. The solar industry has undergone huge transformations in a very short period of time, and sudden changes make for bad business. It was only until recently that the market forces aligned to produce the crystalline silicon solar panel we know today. Before it was a toss-up among crystalline silicon, amorphous silicon, thin film (CIGS, CdTe, etc.), and dye-sensitized. Crystalline silicon worked well, but was outrageously expensive, hence the push for less-efficient but cheaper alternatives.  In the early-2000s, the explosion of consumer electronics stressed the semiconductor-grade silicon market (which is only 10% of the total silicon market, making it succeptible to price increases), driving  silicon panel costs up. A  lot of silicon solar companies ended up going out of business because they couldn't compete with the rising costs of silicon (Evergreen, REC, Ovonic, etc.). Competitors of crystalline silicon tech (namely thin film; amorphous silicon was still stuck with the same silicon economics at lower efficiency) tried to position for market growth. An increase in silicon refining capacity dropped silicon prices, undercutting thin film competition, driving them out of business or acquired (MiaSole, Solyndra, Nanosolar, etc.), leaving crystalline silicon the leading cell technology, however many former competitors had drastically scaled down business due to the earlier price increases. All this happened in roughly 10 years. That doesn't give struggling solar companies on the losing side of technology and economics nearly enough time to restrategize and rebuild. And the see-saw nature of the market made both sides of the silicon vs. thin film tech battle struggle. Since then crystalline silicon solar cells have emerged as the primary standard for panels, driven mostly by the Chinese who have made solar panel manufacturing a national priority. Prices have fallen so much that it now costs more to install these devices than it does to make them.  Again, solar isn't a bad business; the market forces in the mid-2000s just made everyone a loser at one point. Solar is now much more stable and will be; silicon refining isn't going to be allowed to run short again thanks to smartphones in everyone's pockets, and silicon solar cell manufacturing is getting better and better. Now it's all a matter of installation costs.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-solar-energy-start-ups-fail,,,,,
Fake News,Is biased news fake news?,"News is neither biased nor unbiased. It‚Äôs presentation may be either however. Fake news (as understood by those who lean conservative), is an organization that reports unverified, unsourced hypotheticals as news, or those who only report news favorable to the liberal base. Just for an example, I went to MSNBC just this very second and watched a political segment disguised as morning news that aired today Titled ‚ÄúAlong Border, Trump creates a war zone that doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù well, the title‚Äôs a little subjective, but there was nothing presented that wasn‚Äôt factual other than the negative adjectives used to describe Trump or his behavior, which again is subjective. They reported about the women and children being tear gassed, which is true, the horrible conditions, etc. all true. Another way to easily identify fake news is by selective omissions. The most notable selective omissions were the fact that the women and children represent a fraction of the whole, which are young men, that our intelligence community (which this network usually rails Trump for criticizing) has identified about a sixth of them as known felons, that the majority of the caravan‚Äôs members are working with drug cartels (no choice), that the mayor of Tijuana now agrees with Trump, and that Obama gassed these types of party crashers about once a month for similar reasons, and that his administration was separating families too. Most conservatives consider Morning Joe to be fake news, while most liberals have no problem with selective omission it seems. MSNBC certainly knows the facts above, and conservatives would argue that they have a responsibility as a news organization to report them. It‚Äôs why MSNBC is considered biased, and more so than most. Look or listen to see if half the coverage is favorable and half unfavorable to the respective parties. If it is, then it‚Äôs representative of the country, which is pretty evenly split. If it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs biased. (News, not commentary. Commentary is supposed to be biased!) Selective omission is the easiest way to determine which ones are fake, but it requires changing the channel, which most die-hard liberals seem unwilling to do. (I guess that‚Äôs why we call them die-hards.) The other way to identify fake news stories (if you‚Äôd rather not stomach a contrary opinion) is to look at the headline, or listen to the teaser. If it says ‚ÄúMay be trouble, could be the end, should spell impending doom, etc., rather than just stating something that happened, chances are it‚Äôs fake.

Fake News,How do we protect ourselves from fake news?,"Practice critical thinking. Consider the source of what you see, hear, and read. Don't share content unless you've checked it out. Credible content will have sources and will show up in multiple reputable channels. Fake content will usually contain a grain of truth to look credible, but it'll go off on a tangent or introduce incredible assertions. It will often end with a charge to action, like ""and this is why we must elect John Doe to keep the horrible people out of power."" Reputable news sources do not endorse specific candidates or take policy positions in news articles. They may take a position in editorial page essays right before an election or major decision. Editorial page essays hardly ever get distributed beyond the newspaper's website. In Fake news TV and webcasts, presenters will make negative comments about the people on whom they are ""reporting."" They may sound snarky or like ""mean girls"" gossiping. Fake news will sometimes be debunked by fact-checkers associated with major news sources or private services like Snopes. If someone you know sends you something that might be fake news, you can ask them where it came from and why they chose to share it.

Fake News,"Why have we created this new term, ‚Äúfake news‚Äù? Why not call ‚Äúfake news‚Äù as what it is, propaganda?","Fake news is not the same thing as propaganda. A lot of folks who use the expression ‚Äúfake news‚Äù don't really understand what it is, which is reasonable because it's a new phenomenon. Fake news is not partisan news. Fake news is not biased news. Fake news is not Fox News or CNN. Propaganda is biased, partisan news that attempts to persuade. A lot of Fox News is propaganda, but it is not fake news. Fake news refers explicitly to completely phony news sites that claim to be newspapers but aren't or claim to be affiliated with news outlets but aren't, that publish stories that are completely fictitious. For example, go to abcnews dot com dot co. Notice the extra .co on the end of the URL. This site looks like the ABC News site. It has the ABC News logo. It is not ABC News. It is not associated with ABC News. It is owned by a man named Paul Horner. All of the news stories on it are completely made up. They are not spin, they are not slanted, they are completely made up. Paul Horner owns a huge network of fake news sites that publish made-up stories whose purpose is to make people angry. For example, he published a story that an FBI agent investigating Clinton‚Äôs emails had been found murdered. It got millions of hits and was shared millions of times on pro-Trump Facebook groups. Nothing in the story happened. The FBI agent didn't exist. His body was supposedly found in a town that does not exist. The story included an ‚Äúinterview‚Äù with a sheriff who does not exist. The entire story was fake exactly like Harry Potter is fake.

Fake News,What are the issues caused by fake news?,"Fake news is actually just one particular subcategory of propaganda. Do a bit of reading and research into the techniques used by a guy named Joseph Goebbels, who successfully manipulated the thoughts of an entire nation, which allowed for the rise and election of a guy named Adolph Hitler, and then even allowed him to rise from being a President to being a true dictator. The techniques most often used were precisely the same techniques used today by the White House, and Donald Trump, and Breitbart. Even Fox News, for the past several years. They are not new techniques. They have been around forever. Propaganda and the use of spreading a falsehood deliberately is nothing new. One should learn what the techniques are, so one can recognize them for what they are, to resist the manipulation of thought. Some obvious examples: Repeat a lie often enough , and people will gradually begin to accept it is truth. Lie by omission  (leave out the important details or the context (which might cause one to properly understand the truth about that event.)

Fake News,What are the best ways to identify fake news and stop it from spreading?,"You don‚Äôt really need ‚Äòcritical thinking skills‚Äô. There‚Äôs nothing in particular you need to be able to do that you can‚Äôt already; you have the mental faculties needed. What you need instead is knowledge on the nooks and crannies of fake news so you can better predict how to spot them next time. In other words, your already well-equipped brain needs good information to work with so it can do its best in the field.  Here are some basic things you should keep in mind: (1) Articles aren‚Äôt credible sources. They are all essentially opinion pieces; they can be right, wrong, or somewhere in between, and you won‚Äôt know unless you fact-check them. Never use them as a source; all that ever does is force people to track down the real source and check for themselves, which wastes time as well as effort that many people are not often willing to expend. (2) Any headline that sounds like the summary of an opinion is not to be trusted. This is because fake news relies on you to read headlines and not read the article attached; therefore, the headline will attempt to be a succinct summary that you can carry around in your head without any facts to support it. Odds are the article itself is either more nuanced than the title, or else the article is simply biased (and it will be easier to spot bias in an article than in a title, because unsupported opinions are more difficult to convincingly write the longer a piece of writing needs to be). (3) Multiple credible sources or it didn‚Äôt happen. We don‚Äôt always get lucky enough to obtain multiple credible sources for something, but we need to do our best to obtain them. One source, no matter how credible, is usually not enough; we risk falling into the  appeal from authority  fallacy if we stick with the word of one or two ‚Äòexperts‚Äô. By the way, the word ‚Äòcredible‚Äô is incredibly important here. A whole bunch of tabloids running gossip don‚Äôt count. (4) Be suspicious of anyone who has a vested interest in selling you half-truths. This includes certain conservatives, liberals, independents, pro-pizza people, anti-sushi people, etc.; essentially, anyone who would benefit greatly if you believed their side of the story. You should be cautious of everyone, but be especially cautious of these people, because the fact that they have good reason to lie to you means they are likely to go to great lengths to hide their bias or lies. This includes skipping important details, drawing correlations between unrelated things, ignoring crucial possible causes to certain trends, ad hominem attacks, and just about anything else in the book. Truth should never be sold as a service or good; it should be a simple resource - distributed, determined, and examined rigorously for greater understanding. A vendor of truth is not to be trusted, ever. Avoid them, think for yourself, and you‚Äôll be fine. Incidentally, it would be a good idea to read up on the basics of statistics and fallacies before you begin analyzing any work. Not to teach yourself, necessarily, but more to brush up on things you may have forgotten. (5) Remember that  actually  understanding  anything  usually requires immense expertise in a given field; therefore, remain humble when examining the truth so you don‚Äôt become an ‚Äòarmchair authority‚Äô yourself. I‚Äôm sure you hate people who tell you things and expect you to simply believe them because they‚Äôre ‚Äúobvious‚Äù. I do, too; almost everyone hates people who think they‚Äôre better than everyone else. If this is the case, don‚Äôt become what you hate. Keep your wits about you and let truth-seeking remain worthwhile in and of itself; don‚Äôt turn it into a quest for superiority over others. This will allow you to avoid bias in your own work and study of others‚Äô works, which is an unspeakably important skill and a great help in growing as a person.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-identify-fake-news-and-stop-it-from-spreading,Thank you for such clarity of thought and expression.,,,,

And Trump‚Äôs speech to Poland signified nothing about any honest commitment to Poland; he was exactly as truthful in that speech as were his promises of support for universal health care and interracial solidarity made during Trump‚Äôs initial State of the Union Address a few days after he took office. Go back and play your videotape of his words then, and try not to laugh or cry. I will not argue with you about the inaccuracy of your question‚Äôs premise. If you are a shill for the campaign‚Äôs Trump image you seem to be, it is a lost cause. But for everyone who missed the news coverage due to other commitments, who may have doubts about Fox‚Äôs accounts contradicting world coverage, while Mr. Trump was in Europe; please just look at a video of Trump‚Äôs exit from his presidential airplane when it set down in Washington D.C. at the end of that European trip. You will see him step out onto the stairs, shoulders hunched and head drooping; with a glum and defeated expression that tells you he had finally learned that, as to the world beyond U.S. borders, he has deceived no one and the worldwide national leaders uniformly take him precisely for the clown without class that he is. That was true even for Vladimir Putin, who has played him for such a fool since they first met, years ago. The world‚Äôs royalty, presidents, prime ministers and their staffs had spent most of a week attempting to shut him out of group photographs, ignoring his attempts to make the conference seem unsupported by solid fact, and were clearly offended when he pushed through them to be photographed as they looked away from him. Even his daughter was directly asked to stifle herself, being a non-dignitary without cause to be present, when she sat in her father‚Äôs seat during a serious conference on energy production and alternate power sources. Later we learned that Mr. Trump had gone downstairs for a private meeting with Mr. Putin, who was reading him the riot act about his incompetent leak of the secret agreements they had reached to protect Russian interests, prior to Mr. Trump‚Äôs inauguration. There is no misunderstanding the body language Mr. Trump conveyed as he returned to the U.S., even without any voiceover from any news agency. He is visibly a defeated man, insofar as portraying himself as a serious international figure. He knows now he has lost any hope for international respect, and is left with only the support of the few Americans who haven‚Äôt figured out what hides behind the lies he can conjure up on any whim to deflect the shocking revelations breaking in the news about him daily. And now he sits back in Washington, where within a few weeks his former staffers, his son and his son-in-law will be expecting indictments for treason and breach of their public responsibilities, and the specter of impeachment and multiple indictments for matters before and after the election await him personally. Is it possible to admire the president only for having a poker face?",https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Europe-shocked-at-the-CNN-fake-news-on-the-first-day-of-Trumps-visit-to-Poland,"Uh, that is a put down to anyone who actually plays poker‚Ä¶but point taken.","I don‚Äôt think anyone cares about US politics other than US politicians and the US media, which have turned it into a consumer product.",,,

Crypto Currency,"What would happen if I put $1,000 into every crypto currency?","Interesting question. There have been some good answers already mainly around the fact that you will lose on 99% of the coins, so a spray and pray probably isn‚Äôt your best best. Just for kicks lets build some pretty charts. First, lets stay away from the smaller cap coins and look at the top 10‚Äì15 in market cap. These coins cover 80‚Äì90% of the total market capitalization already anyways. An assumption I‚Äôm going to make is that you want to buy every cryptocurrency because you want to invest in the entire market instead of trying to pick the winners. You can pretty much buy coins that represent 90%+ of the market with only around 10‚Äì15 coins, so there‚Äôs no need to go to 2000. This is what would happen if you put $1000 in 3, 4, 5 and 7 of the larger cap coins on Jan 1 2017. The purple line is Bitcoin.  This is not investment advice :) Assume these are just random coins I picked in the top 10‚Äì15 on coinmarketcap. Heres the breakdown: Top 3 - BTC, LTC, ETH ( 70%  coverage of the total market cap) Top 4 - BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC ( 74%  coverage of the total market cap) Top 5 - BTC ETH BCH LTC XMR ( 74%  coverage of the total market cap) EMBER 7 - BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, XMR, DASH ( 82%  coverage of the total market cap) Fine print:  past performance is no guarantee of future results but lets look back because well‚Ä¶ thats all we can do. And the start date was arbitrarily set at Jan 1, 2017. If you had purchased at the top of the market, this would look a lot different (read  worse ). Hopefully this gives you at least a sense of what  could  happen if you put $1000 in a few coins that cover a lot of the market and just held it (without rebalancing, etc). Let me know if you have questions!",https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-put-1-000-into-every-crypto-currency,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What are some good ideas when buying crypto currency?,"Here are the Top 7 mistakes that I have seen people make over the last years. If you don‚Äôt make these mistakes you are already better than 99% of all crypto traders. However, even if people know about all of these mistakes that they shouldn‚Äôt make, everyone makes these mistakes at least 5 times before actually having internalized them. Being emotional. The best trader is the trader without any emotions, that is not phased by a 200% increase or a 70% dip and just takes profits or rebuys more. Not buying low and selling high. This might seem obvious, but the majority of crypto traders simply do the opposite. How do I know? Because people bought in lots of Bitcoin when it was already at $15,000 and they sold lots when it was down at $10,000 and some even sold when it was down at $7,000 making it crash to $5,800. Making all or nothing buys. They either sell all of their Bitcoins or either buy all of their Bitcoins. An experienced trader only sells 10% of their Bitcoin when they have made 50% gains, another 10%, when they have made 100% gains and always sell another 10% of their Bitcoins the higher it goes. That way, they always make profits and also have money to rebuy the dips. Inexperienced traders never sell, because they become too greedy or sell everything too early. Putting all of their eggs in 1 basket. Don‚Äôt only hold 1 coin, hold the best 10 coins you can find and one of them will likely make a 1,000% return and make up for the losses of all the other 9 coins. Putting all their coins on 1 wallet. Have your coins distributed through exchanges, online wallets, cold wallets and paper wallet, so that if one gets hacked or you lose it, you don‚Äôt lose it all. Invest more that they can afford to lose. If you put more money into crypto than you can afford to lose, you also become much more emotional and make bad trades. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle. Instead, only put 10%of your whole networth maximum into crypto. Buying coins that are hyped without any substantial improvement in tech. Examples are: EOS, Tron, Bitcoin, Litecoin. EOS is worse than Elastos, but has a 20x higher market cap, only through hype and also possibly through artificial pumping by the EOS team. It is extremely centralized with 21 voting nodes and Elastos offers a lot more functionality for dapps and is even more scalable. This is why EOS will drop in price significantly soon while Elastos will go up. Tron should only be worth a few hundred million but is worth billion, because Justin Sun was thought to have a partnership with Alibaba even though he only attended the same university as Jack Ma.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-ideas-when-buying-crypto-currency,"I find the third point quite interesting. As a novice trader myself, I have made the mistake of not spreading out my purchase/ sell trades and instead doing it all in one go. For a sell strategy, is selling 10% for every 50% portfolio gain an optimal strategy? Is there an equivalent strategy while buying crypto? For example, one way is to invest 20% every week over 5 weeks to utilise the dips or gains effectively. What do you think? Cheers",,,,
Crypto Currency,Will crypto currencies achieve permanence?,"Yes. :) Edit:
Apologies to everyone for not actually answering this question sooner.  Cryptocurrencies have very interesting features that mean they are likely here as long as humanity is:   Anyone with the ability to fork Bitcoin can create one. New technology is in development to make this even easier and more robust.  They can be used by anyone with minimal technological requirement They are inherently global in their reach Cryptocurrencies can be programmable, allowing money to do interesting things that money traditionally can't do.
 They fill the role of traditional currency at a fraction of the cost and without the need to trust centralized sources of issuance The idea is useful and exists, there's no going back.

What circumstances can you imagine that make cryptocurrency as a technology irrelevant? I can't think of any that don't also take down the internet and/or other tech systems. Will there be hiccups? Yeah, there already have been, it will take some time to iron out the kinks, but it's happening rapidly.",https://www.quora.com/Will-crypto-currencies-achieve-permanence,Can you elaborate? What makes you so confident?,"That isn't an answer. I would like some kind of an explanation, especially since Mt. Gox crashed and burned, and Spaincoin became a huge scam.

Crypto Currency,What are the main threats for crypto-currencies like bitcoin?,"Hey, I came across one good article on the internet regarding the same. Any new, disruptive technology will have its fair share of detractors doing their best to limit its potential. The idea that people would need their own personal computer for work seemed ludicrous 50 years ago. Why would anyone need a device for making automated calculations? Today, though, it is almost impossible to function in modern life without using a PC. The automated teller machine, or ATM, was thought to be a needless apparatus by many when it came out. Who would need access to money outside of bank hours? Now, more people use ATMs than go and queue in branches. Bitcoin is a new concept edging its way into the mainstream, thus, it is not immune to negativity and unfavorable public perception. It is undeniable that the digital currency has its enemies, either real people or perceived notions. So what are some of the biggest problems it faces right now? The centralization of bitcoin The idea of mining, for many who first come across the concept of bitcoin, seems bizarre. When broken down into a peer-to-peer way of  confirming transactions , however, it makes a lot of sense. It made a lot more sense, though, when any bitcoin node, on any computer, had a chance to confirm transactions and thus be rewarded a block. But that doesn‚Äôt happen anymore. Although bitcoin was built with good intentions in mind, altruistic systems are often exploited. And this is what has happened to the bitcoin network. The problem is that there is  little incentive to run a node anymore . That‚Äôs because powerful machines built specifically for bitcoin‚Äôs SHA-256 proof-of-work algorithm have changed its decentralized and more open nature.  Power curve: Difficulty on the Bitcoin network over the past year.  Source:  Blockchain This has, in effect, concentrated bitcoin‚Äôs confirmation power, leaving it in the hands of only those who can afford thousands of dollars of  ASIC hardware . Bad actors Bitcoin largely solves the  double-spending  issue. Despite that, remarkable technical achievement, it doesn‚Äôt cater for mistakes, theft and fraud quite so well. The anonymous digital currency has sometimes attracted the wrong types of people ‚Äì those looking to prey on others who fall under the spell of a never-ending upward trend for bitcoin‚Äôs  price . Whether it‚Äôs illegal online marketplaces, pump-and-dump schemes or shady crypto exchanges, they all create a black cloud over the industry. And, every time there is another bitcoin robbery or scam, it draws attention from the mainstream.  Now-failed Mt. Gox was once the dominant exchange.  Source:  Pantera Capital When leaders in the bitcoin industry are discouraged over their inability to be  banked in the US , bad actors are the ones who should be blamed. The bad actor problem creates a consumer protection issue for bitcoin. When people learn about bitcoin and are lured to products and services that do not follow best practices, as opaque as they may be in this industry, that‚Äôs a problem. As a result, some countries are simply playing safe and pushing bitcoin away from their banking systems. Reactionary regulation According to CoinDesk‚Äôs  2014 Q1 State of Bitcoin Report , 12% of the 73 countries that have taken some regulatory action on bitcoin can be considered hostile or contentious.  Source:  Bitcoin Q1 2014 A number of countries taking a stance against digital currencies appear to be more reactionary in their behaviour than seems justified. One example is India, where a bitcoin exchange in that country  was raided  earlier this year, causing some bitcoin businesses to cease operating. In China, the major operators there are talking about  upcoming periods of hardship  as the government  cracks down  on bitcoin activities. Furthermore, amid rumors of a ban on virtual currencies in Russia, organizers recently felt impelled to  cancelled a bitcoin conference  that was planned to be held there. These actions perhaps reflect more about the banking systems of those countries than anything a government official says. It reveals that many financial systems don‚Äôt want to compete with bitcoin; they would rather regulate it out of existence. A patchwork of reactionary regulatory policies helps no one. This is especially true since international borders simply cannot restrict bitcoin, the decentralized nature of which makes it impossible to ban. A better approach could be a wait-and-see attitude towards this new technology, since its advantages could end up befitting everyone. Countries currently taking this kind of approach include Canada and Israel. Poor mobile platform support Since  last year , Apple has taken a proactive stance towards making sure that users  cannot send bitcoin  via wallets in its App Store. Furthermore, Google does not allow in-app payments with bitcoin. Although this has not deterred some developers from creating mobile applications for bitcoin, it‚Äôs harming the ecosystem. These larger technology companies do not want to compete with bitcoin. So they do the same thing as restrictive governments and use their power to regulate it out of existence ‚Äì within their ecosystem, anyway.  Will bitcoin grow with the rise of smart devices capable of remote payments?  Source:  GigaOm Bitcoin is excellent as a method of remote payment. It could be a competitive credit card alternative ‚Äì especially in remote transactions with  mobile or wearable devices . And this is a much better way to receive and send payments instead of using of QR codes. Using Bluetooth Low Energy, Near field communication (NFC) or some other wireless technology could change the way people make payments. However, with billions of dollars relying on the outcome, the major players in the technology industry will do their best to restrict innovations that they do not control. Low adoption Given all of the above issues, it's not incredibly obvious why the average person would want to use bitcoin. Sure, there are many theoretical benefits to using a distributed currency. What is the value, though, to the everyday person who just wants to ensure that money is in the bank? One issue is that banks often overstepped boundaries and the global economic situation has brought hardship for many since 2008. The appearance of bitcoin on the scene represents something new and offers hope to people jaded by traditional financial institutions. Circle  and  Bitreserve  are both bitcoin startups that have recently unveiled plans to bring the digital currency to the masses. They plan to do so by bringing the technology's benefits to the consumer market by not exposing user to the bitcoin 'layer' it still depends upon.  Is bitcoin stuck in the early adopter chasm?  Source:  Biznology Many startups in the bitcoin space tout the 'wow' factor of bitcoin. Yet negative events over the past year have left consumer sentiment less positive than the industry hoped for and this, in turn, has caused tension with policymakers. In the end, it is possible the best way to get bitcoin's benefits into the hands of people might be to not talk about it at all.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-threats-for-crypto-currencies-like-bitcoin,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What are the most common misconceptions about crypto-currencies?,"Here are 10 most common misconceptions. The underlying pattern shows that most stem from misconceptions about currency. Crypto currencies are a bubble.  Nope. We do not have a clear definition what a bubble is. If there is such a thing, and if there were we do not know  until  its popped. Something nobody can predict, since that would require actionable information outside the system. To iterate, the same was said about Nixon leaving Bretton Woods and going full fiat on the dollar: it‚Äôs a bubble. Crypto currencies are volatile.  Nope. Their exchange rate to a basket of other currencies maybe  is  volatile. Some fiat currencies‚Äô exchange rates have been even more hectic. And so what? You can get in and out of a position. Buy bitcoin last minute at whatever price, transact with someone in real relative non stable prices like you would if you are in a foreign country, sell whatever bitcoin you have left, be quick about it. Minimal exposure. Volatility only matters if you  keep  your current account positions for days or longer. Don‚Äôt do that, unless you want to speculate (which thrives on volatility) which will end badly most of the time. Crypto currencies can be invested in.  Nope. You can speculate on its exchange rates‚Äô appreciation. Investment is something entirely different. Also, stock picking advice ‚Äúwhat is the best‚Ä¶‚Äù is an anti portfolio strategy. It does not work. Crypto currencies are decentralized, opensource and blockchain based.  Nope. Cryptos can be forked to be fiat, government issued, centrally issued, gold backed, sea shell backed and have any feature you like. It‚Äôs just that most popular current instances of crypto-alt-currencies aren‚Äôt. Crypto currencies have no value.  Nope. Currencies have exchange-value up to the value of extra trades enabled (including speculative trades). Oh, yes‚Ä¶ and the dollar is not the end-all yardstick of value, and ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù value is not a thing since electricity, the end of slavery, and combustion engines. Currencies should be nominally stable.  Nope. Currencies, unlike most fiats, do not need a stable price-level in order to function. The need to keep your wealth tied up into a current account is actually very costly. Stable currencies are pegged to their historic selves, and pegging is always bad. You see, deflation/inflation is only costly if it is unexpected. And it‚Äôs unexpected only when you just lulled people into a money illusion. Store wealth in credit markets not in your matras. Issuers should not benefit from currencies.  What a load of nonsense! The banking system arguably gets a even bigger subsidy with the fractional banking scheme. Also, the onus of proof is on the claimant, that most cryptos are intentional ‚Äúgreater fool‚Äù ponzi schemes. Cryptos will or wont replace fiats.  Nope. That‚Äôs not how innovation works. Horses are still a thing, so are candles, so are sailing ships. Hell, tulips are a 3 billion euro market. Moreover, again, cryptos can be fiats. You have to buy a whole bitcoin to speculate on its exchange rate.  Nope.   If you are that misinformed about divisibility you should not be handling money. Period. Crypto currencies are not legal tender everywhere.  So what? Currency, like innovation, works fine without governments. Legality is not a prerequisite to currency. Nor is traceability. Nor is confiscatability. Nor is touchability. Nor is monetary policeability. Nor is nominal stability. We had money before we had governments, so it‚Äôs not a stretch to argue that governments tend to tax currency up to its‚Äô marginal added value.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-misconceptions-about-crypto-currencies,,,,,
Crypto Currency,What are your opinions on the world of crypto currency?,"It‚Äôs a good investment for the foreseeable future‚Äîlikely until the debt uncertainties caused by the 2008 financial crisis and COVID are resolved. In the US, which now requires reporting crypto currency investments, only 8% of the population owns crypto. The number is probably lower in most countries, since the US is always an early adopter of anything internet. As more people join the crypto market, the value will increase. This will go on until 100% of anyone who wants crypto has it. Sure, there are bubbles, currencies will fall, but unless you bought  Bitconnect  or some trash coin and ended up being scammed, in the long run, your crypto will continue to go up in value as more people buy it. You might lose 40% of your money this year, but in the next 3 years, your assets will increase in value. Now, there are extremely stupid ways to invest in crypto. Investing income you need in crypto is dumb. You will have to sell that crypto (possibly at a loss) to get your money and buy things like groceries. All of the scare mongers saying you should prepare to ‚Äúlose it all‚Äù are exaggerating. The only people who have lost it all invested in scams like Bitconnect, or engaged in day trading. The crypto market is extremely unstable. Since I started investing in it in 2016, one fundamental has changed majorly. In 2016, coins gained and lost value independently of each other. In 2018 however, it all started to be tied to Bitcoin.   Coins gain and lose value to Fiat currencies, as Bitcoin does. They may gain more or lose more, but when Bitcoin falls, they fall within hours. When Bitcoin rises, they rise within hours. Personally, I hate Bitcoin. Compared to most utility coins like Ripple, Stellar Lumen, Siacoin, Golem, Bittorrent, it is technologically backwards, completely inferior in every way, wastes more energy, and is overall junk. Bitcoin is slow. The only coin slower than Bitcoin is its twin brother, Bitcoin Cash:  That? That‚Äôs why Bitcoin needs Segregated Witness. Conducting transactions using the blockchain is impractically slow because Bitcoin is demonstrably technologically inferior to most newer cryptos. I find it frustrating that Bitcoin is setting the prices for everything and continues to dominate the market. I really don‚Äôt get it when Bitcoin fans tell me things like ‚Äúall the other trash currencies will die.‚Äù Ripple has transaction speeds comparable to VISA, which all the banks use, while Bitcoin has become unusable. In 2017/2018, Bitcoin lost value compared to most other cryptos, but then at the end of 2018 when the whole market lost value, a lot of the market flowed back to Bitcoin. But I digress. I think the reason why Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained market dominance is simply that US and British corporations have started investing in it. Many people enter the crypto market by buying Bitcoin on PayPal‚ÄîIt‚Äôs not like you can buy SiaCoin or Golem on PayPal. The growth starts in Bitcoin, then people sell their Bitcoin and buy other alt-coins which gain and lose value faster. This is something I can rationally explain. Here‚Äôs why I do not advise crypto trading. To trade in crypto, as opposed to holding it longterm, you have to think like a complete idiot drawing lines on a chart. Here is one idiotic things that is true of the crypto market that is a microcosm of the whole imbecilic system: Crypto coins typically have 3 upward moves, then 2 downward moves in correction, then 3 upward moves, then 2 downward moves. Exceptions are when the whole market loses its value or explodes. What qualifies as a ‚Äúmove up‚Äù depends on your point of view and is highly subjective. Examples:   MovieBloc, this thing I made A$700 in this morning:  Why does this happen? In the stock and commodities markets, experts talk about supply, demand, fundamentals, debt. In the crypto world, you have people nonsensically pointing at the shape of lines:  It‚Äôs all subjective but it drives a large portion of buyer behaviour. Millions of crypto traders watch these videos, then learn to think in terms of 3 moves up, 2 moves down, ‚Äúbreaking arcs,‚Äù ‚Äúsupport holding‚Äù ‚Äúpump and dump‚Äù and so on. The trading is done on thin air based on debunked theories of economics like  Gann angles . Gann angles are visual and open to interpretation. The angle depends on where you are drawing on a chart, and the scale of a chart: ‚ÄúCritics note that Gann did not set down rules for such cases and that the positioning of the angles on a chart is therefore entirely arbitrary and not scientific. This may not necessarily invalidate the methods Gann used himself, as it is not known whether he intentionally left some parts undisclosed.‚Äù My theory is that Gann angles only work because people believe they work. Many traders of crypto are looking at these Gann angles and when the arbitrary shape of the movement of the price looks like it fits breaking through a Gann Angle, they then buy. When the price dips below an angle, they sell. To me, it‚Äôs very stressful having to play 4-dimensional chess and think like an idiot. Now, with new Apps like Robin Hood, crypto traders are entering the world of the stock market so I expect the stock market will start to look more and more like the crypto market. In any case, I am going to go back to holding once the market settles down.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-opinions-on-the-world-of-crypto-currency,,,,,
Fake News,"Who coined the term ""fake news""?","Well‚Ä¶ The term ‚Äúfake news‚Äù is all over the place right now. It has been these last few years. But let‚Äôs start with a question that, I believe, should come before ‚Äúwho‚Äù: exactly  what are fake news? We can say that it is content, meant to pass as a news article, that is not based on any facts. We can simplify it by saying it‚Äôs a lie. I tried to check what was available on  Wikipedia , but the article didn‚Äôt specify who coined that term (although it  may  have been first used in the 19th century). However, most of what makes up the current concept of fake news is nothing new. The ‚Äúyellow press‚Äù reportedly made their newspapers really profitable with its use - sensationalism is also an old practice. Before there was such a thing as clickbait, plenty of newspapers and magazines were using it to generate profit. Shocking news sell. And, let‚Äôs be honest: we all love a reason to be offended with something. A little bit further down the road, there are misinformation and propaganda, which are obviously mush dangerous. Controlling the press for political reasons is a classic landmark of a dictatorship. If you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, you will be less likely to question anything. A state that has full control over the media across the nation tends to make HUGE budget cuts on education. Go figure. But fake news is a little bit different from these two. It spreads quickly. It is, in a few ways, similar to misinformation in the sense that it is meant to cause confusion and instill fear. People who post fake news online might know what they are doing and do it for the money. Others just want to feel the power that comes from knowing people are spreading the word about something that you know it‚Äôs bullshit, and that you are the sole responsible for that. People can be that weird and twisted, yeah. I wish I didn‚Äôt know that. About who coined the term, yeah‚Ä¶ I still do not know who did it. If anyone finds out, let me know. And yes, I know everyone‚Äôs thinking about Trump. But I highly doubt he understands what ‚Äúfake news‚Äù are (SPOILER ALERT: it has nothing to do about whether you like them or not). I guess it‚Äôs just quicker to type ‚Äúfake news‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù when you‚Äôre tweeting furiously. And it‚Äôs obviously really easy to spell.",https://www.quora.com/Who-coined-the-term-fake-news,"Fake news was started by Eric Schmidt from Google.

However Trump took it over bye throwing fake news back at his accusers. After the after the election, during Trump's first press conference he got into it a little bit with Jim Acosta from CNN. He was calling CNN fake news refuse to let CNN ask any questions. Then Trump went on a bit of a rant about the media. He made it very clear that there were two kinds of media the regular media that reported factually and where more or less unbiased. Then he said the fake media, the fake news, were the enemies of the American people. He made it clear that he was speakng about those who distort and misrepresent the truth, not the real media.

Fake News,Who spreads the most fake news?,"I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre American, and with that you‚Äôre asking this question due to the political climate in the country, when it comes to fake news I believe all news channels are guilty of it, but there‚Äôs a difference, I‚Äôll use CNN and Fox for this comparison, CNN loves to add opinions to facts and thus end up sounding dumb to viewers not watching to fuel their political egos, they usually have good news telling skills, but when they goof they goof bad, they also have a habit of jumping on a story before all facts have come to light and I personally dislike it, and in the other corner we have Fox, they also have more or less the same problems as CNN except they don‚Äôt usually jump on stories before having the full picture, and they seem to have separate shows away from the main news programs that deal heavily in opinions, I think that‚Äôs how they beat the discerning eyes, Fox News is biased like any other news channel, but they don‚Äôt like to show that bias in their main programs, actually they are more or less robots in their main programs, and instead allocate the heavy opinions to secondary shows, to dismiss any obvious signs of bias.",https://www.quora.com/Who-spreads-the-most-fake-news,"except that they present the opinion shows like they are factually based, so their viewers assume that these pundits are journalists and telling the truth, when nothing could be further from reality.",,,,
Fake News,"Now that CNN is confirmed as fake news, what will happen to CNN?","Just to be clear, CNN was confirmed as fake news a long time ago. Coaching focus groups, sneaking advance debate questions to Democrats, cutting off the camera when someone starts to criticize Hillary, and on and on. My guess is CNN will slip a little bit in the ratings, but only marginally. CNN caters to the far-left, and the far-left thinks CNN is real news. Its core audience overwhelmingly prefers non-stop Russia coverage (often falsified if there is none to be had) to facts and real news. Other left-wing sources like WaPo and the NYT assure them that CNN is real news, so the 700,000 people who watch Don Lemon will keep tuning in to get their nightly dose of fake news. I did notice that Jim Acosta wasn‚Äôt in the front row at the press briefing today, which was fantastic. I personally feel that nobody from that outlet should even be allowed the briefing room, and each time that CNN is caught putting out fake news and admitting to pushing Russia narratives for ratings cements their fake news status. They were boasting on Twitter about their ratings, but left out the part that they‚Äôre getting beaten by Fox, MSNBC, and even Nickelodeon and HGTV. Fake news is out of style.

Solar Energy,How do I convert solar energy into heat?,"Thanks for the A2A. Solar energy is received on earth in the form of light and heat.  We use a solar collector to harvest the heat (the same way we use a photovoltaic panel to convert light to electricity) It is very well possible to use the electricity generated by a Photovoltaic plant for heating purposes.  However, it is a very inefficient process as there is double conversion. The best way to go about addressing your energy home energy needs is to split the heating and non heating requirements. The heating needs can be met by solar thermal systems and the electrical/non heating requirements can be met with photovoltaic systems.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-convert-solar-energy-into-heat,,,,,
Solar Energy,Is solar energy the most abundant source of energy?,"With the exception of geothermal and nuclear, ALL electrical power generation can be traced back to the sun. The sun, after all, provided the energy that grew the plants and other biomass eons ago that became our fossil fuels today. The wind power we have today is also dependent upon solar energy, most of it far out to sea on this planet that is 7 tenths ocean. So let‚Äôs compare the relative efficiencies, just generally, not with specific numbers, to direct solar power generation, either thermal towers heated from an array of thousands of tracking mirrors, or direct to a field of PV panels. First the fossil fuels we use (‚Äúrocks that burn‚Äù) i.e. Coal, and natural gas. Oil is not used very often in generating plants, but oil and gas are found together so that what is good or bad about gas tends to be in common with its extraction processes. Good is that we know where it is, how much is there, and have a system in place to get it to the generating stations in a timely manner, all of which is paid for through the ‚Äúoil economy‚Äù that is the world standard at this time. Bad is that there are pollution costs that cannot be avoided at every stage of that process, and in many cases those costs are rising along with the costs of its extraction. There are health costs as well. The fracking for oil and gas uses tremendous amounts of water that gets contaminated and can potentially make its way to our drinking water aquifers. As much as our living standard has been raised by the uses to which we put that source of stored energy, that we are using up in just centuries when it took millions of years for the earth to concentrate it where it is economically to be found. A lot of that pollution is in the form of the carbon in the hydrocarbon, when for our burning purposes what we want is the hydrogen in those complex molecules. Natural gas is cleaner, of course, but only because methane is a much simpler hydrocarbon with a better ratio of hydrogen locked in it, and far less ‚Äúmystery mass‚Äù than oil or coal, quite a lot being toxic when burned. Coal is rapidly disappearing as a power plant fuel in the U.S. When the various costs are added up, the choice, even though it is plentiful, is to convert to gas or close older power stations that use it. Coal will still be useful in chemical processes but burning it should stop for our children‚Äôs sake. Second, lets examine wind power. It has an advantage over PV solar, in that it does blow at night, and as I said, seven tenths of the earth is a bigger source than the sunnier climes on land. Still, we do locate the turbines in good windscapes where it is economic to build them, on or very near to land. The wind is a part of hydro power too. Again from solar energy heated surface water far out to sea, delivered by wind driven clouds of fresh water,(no expensive reverse osmosis needed) to rain and snowmass storage on our mountains, all at nature‚Äôs expense, we merely have to capture it with either water turbine generators or wind turbine generators. Construction costs are fairly high in both processes, and wind turbines ‚Äúfuel‚Äù gets delivered free, if somewhat sporadically, meaning an extensive and flexible grid structure is required for reliability with just that source in use. The wind does blow somewhere all the time, just not everywhere. Snowmass and rainfall is also a variable commodity from year to year. Third, we consider direct solar. We can count on that source to make an appearance on as regular schedule as anything we do schedule, after all it is how me mark time. It does vary in intensity, but like the wind, it is sunny somewhere at all times of the day, just not everywhere. Solar generation by concentrated heating for steam turbines has the advantage of location where that sunshine is most plentiful, but shares with its fossil fueled stations maintenance and the losses of long grid connections to customers. Its business model is familiar to power utilities, which is why it has tended to be favored. Some newer plants have incorporated thermal storage of heat from the day to run the turbines far into the night. The up front costs are high, but the plant lifespan is similar to the fossil fueled generators. PV is also built at corporate scaled size of the plants, though the same technology can be used at the end user sites right on rooftops. That poses problems for the utilities as their installed grid is not designed for such an array of distributed sources of energy. It can be reworked to the benefit of both ratepayers and providers( and ratepayers who ARE providers) but it will take time, money and the will to make it happen. The grid structure will still be needed for evening out power distribution from where the sun is too strong to where it is clouded out. PV efficiency of conversion of solar energy is perhaps the highest and it is rising in development as the costs of manufacture are dropping. I know some engineers might argue that 20% conversion is too small, but if you take the losses from every step in the solar energy chain to fossil fueled electrical power production, that 20%, right at the point of use looks mighty good to me. Add in a high quality battery system to extend use into the night and for rainy days, and it looks even better. But electricity storage was never a large part of our present grid system. Hydropower, in the past could store potential ‚Äúdispatchable‚Äù energy, but not as instantaneous as batteries can. So to your question, ‚ÄúWhy is solar power the best energy source?‚Äù Because it has always been our energy source of choice, and like most products, it is better when we get it straight from the the source with as little processing as possible, like the finest fruits and vegetables are. Since those are not always available, we will still have to depend upon less direct, more processed, and more costly distribution systems, and use those fossils extracted from the earth in ways that do not burn, and pollute, nor consume them so much faster than the earth can absorb the side effects from that highly profligate use.",https://www.quora.com/Is-solar-energy-the-most-abundant-source-of-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,What new jobs will solar energy create?,"Search ""solar"" in any online job site and you'll see. The largest number of positions is for installers of the equipment. Contruction and electrical background, or special solar installation training is needed for these positions. However, every project, big or small, requires system designers/engineers, project managers, sales and marketing, procurement and warehouse staff, adminstrative, the list goes on.  Those given are for installation companies only. There are many more in manufacturing and distribution of the equipment, as well as financing and development of projects.  Many don't realize that utilities are responsible for much of the development in solar. Sometimes they will rely on outside specialists, but they may also manage projects themselves. Either way, they'll be hiring specialized staff for these new roles.  Although solar is largely maintenance free, a few jobs will be created in operations and maintenance (O&M). Much of this is preventive, but occasionally parts do need to be replaced, and on large installations, in some locations, panels need cleaning or to be cleared of snow.  My own business is in a small niche of O&M. I develop and sell supplies for those occasions when pests decide to nest beneath residential installations. Pigeons and squirrels have been found to create some real messes and can be damaging to property and solar equipment alike.

Solar Energy,Will solar energy ever become cheap?,"This is a picture of a large steam turbine. We find such magnificent machines at large coal and nuclear power plants. We would also find smaller steam turbines at cogeneration natural gas plants. To the casual observer, a natural gas turbine would look the same. This is arguably an odd place to start our journey as we explore the cost of solar. However, you will soon see why it is necessary.  Source:  File:Dampfturbine Montage01.jpg Let‚Äôs start by recognizing the utility of these machines. They have reliably powered our homes for generations. Some people have gone so far as to suggest that these turbines located at coal plants have become a nuisance ‚Äî climate change and all‚Ä¶ As reliable and productive as these machines are, we must recognize that turbine based generators are not 100% reliable. Things go wrong and they trip off line. They also require periodic maintenance from time to time, as shown in the opening picture. The power grid, upon which so much of our prosperity rests, was built with this fact in mind. It has redundancies to account for the occasional failures. Should a generator suddenly fail, there is another generator to instantaneously take up the slack. For example, let‚Äôs assume our nation demands 50 GW of power and that each generator in our hypothetical system provides 1 GW of power. We would say that N generators are required where N in this example, is a count of 50. However, we want some redundancy in case something goes wrong, so we add one more generator. We now have N + 1 generators running. On a moment by moment basis, the grid operators take care of this problem by matching generation to demand while keeping a spinning reserve just in case something goes wrong. We should take a moment to say thank you to the women and men who take care of this system for us. Standing that watch in the control room is no easy task. I thank you for staying alert and quickly responding to keep the lights on in my home. As a rule, the generation in any region is matched to the region‚Äôs load. It‚Äôs like any other service. For example, the economics of the region will determine the number of supermarkets that can be supported. Armed with this simple thought, we can shift our attention to solar. Solar is no different then the steam turbine. It‚Äôs a generator that can power our homes and industry. You should not question the capability of the technology as we see it operating in places such as California. Solar is just another generator. Like any other generator, solar can also trip off-line. In our previous example, we were keen to keep a reserve larger than the largest generator at the ready. We assumed that N was the size of the largest generator and we made sure we had +1 ready at all times. When solar goes off-line, something it does every day, we must have the +1 generator take over. Suppose solar was providing 90% of the power (45 GW) for our hypothetical nation, when the sun goes down, we would need to shift the entire 45 GW load to something else. Why does solar energy cost so much? The price is high, because we need to provide for the +1 when solar goes to sleep at night. You may point out that we have wind on some nights. That may be a true statement for most, but not all nights. What it really means, is that we have +1 wind generation sitting idle in the day and +1 of something else idle when either the sun is up or the wind is blowing. The math says we have overbuilt the system by a factor of three. We have three fully functional systems to provide for our needs. You see, it was never a question about the cost of solar, it is a question about the design and function of the larger system. Where do we go from here? If we assume that fossil fuels are part of the solution, the cost to provide the backup for wind and solar isn‚Äôt excessive. Case in point, this is how California operates today. You can see the dance between solar and natural gas with nuclear proving a steady base here at  California ISO - Supply . While you are there, ask yourself what powers the generators that provide California‚Äôs imported energy? If we assume that fossil fuels are excluded, we enter uncharted territory. We must provide +1 storage for a time exceeding the worst dark doldrums we are likely to encounter. Alternatively, we must transport energy from our neighbor who may or may suffer the same weather pattern. In either case, we end up a large system that operates intermittently. Expensive things that operate intermittently are called liabilities. Like we already established, the economics of the region will determine the number of supermarkets that can be supported. Stated another way, it is extremely unlikely that we could ever reach 100%. Just like a supermarket, it‚Äôs hard to stay open when the foot traffic (percent utilization) is low. Speaking of supermarkets, please consider all forms of carbon free energy in our inventory. For example, how would the carbon emissions be reduced if we tripled the nuclear energy in California? Regards, APDahlen P.S. The economic lesson from this piece is presented as a short story here:  Aaron Dahlen's answer to Is solar energy actually economically viable?",https://www.quora.com/Will-solar-energy-ever-become-cheap,"The analogy you make here is pretty good. An N-1 event assumes the immediate loss of the element, in this case a generator. The decline or down ramp of solar production due to sunset wouldn‚Äôt be immediate however and isn‚Äôt exactly a contingency event. Also it likely wouldn‚Äôt be just a single unit responding to a trip, but rather the entire fleet depending on how reserves are allocated.","This is well-written, interesting and thought provoking. It is clear from your answer that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar cannot possibly replace what we have now. Nuclear energy can fill the gap, as can fossil fuels. But nuclear energy comes with the problem of disposing of waste which could have a half-life of dangerous radioactivity for 100,000 years or so. And fossil fuels are thought to be culprits in global climate change, and are not infinite resources. Sooner or later, they will be used up. As you have pointed out, ‚ÄúYou see, it was never a question about the cost of solar, it is a question about the design and function of the larger system.‚Äù So would it be possible for us to design systems which eliminate the ‚Äúlarger system‚Äù - the large power companies, the complex distribution networks and the huge turbines? Yes, I am suggesting that the sustainable and cost-effective way forward is the development of off-grid power. The main ingredient which still needs significant improvement here is electrical storage: efficient and affordable batteries. Tesla have made a start on this with the development of the Powerwall, but the technology is in its infancy - about on a level with the Spitfire for aviation. At the level of the individual household, storage to compensate for ‚Äúoutages‚Äù is possible. So what about people who live at higher latitudes, and lack a Californian climate? Well, I live in the UK, and although not many homes here are completely off grid, it is not uncommon for homes to have solar panels on the roof, and even to produce a surplus of electricity during daylight hours. We also have plenty of windfarms, which are working well. The main difficulty is actually with the grid system which has historically been designed for the output of coal-fired power stations. If this grid system could be redesigned to provide power to local areas rather than transporting it for long distances, then it could well become even more cost-effective than it is at present. There are also plenty of buildings such as factories and government facilities which have a great deal of roof space which could be used for solar panels. It is easy to start playing games of ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, but‚Ä¶‚Äù when it comes to taking action to secure a better future for our world, but what we really need is people of intelligence and imagination who can see the possibilities which lie ahead, and want to cash in on them. People, in other words, who can sort out ‚Äúthe design and function of the larger system‚Äù.","Ahhh, a complex problem described at the level I understand things. Thank you.","Very good post, Aaron. It‚Äôs not just about windmills and solar panels, it‚Äôs all about how the electrical grid works. It‚Äôs designed, built, operated and maintained to deliver electricity instantly on demand. The rotating masses of the turbines and generators are the key to its performance. Every generator is synchronized to the others, whether driven by water (hydro) or steam (coal, gas, oil, biomass, nuclear) or natural gas and this is the key to it‚Äôs usefulness as well as a big challenge. Wind and solar can only contribute intermittently, and just add costs to the grid. When considering the complete system, grid level wind and solar don‚Äôt add much for reliability or savings.",
Solar Energy,Is solar energy viable in India?,"Few major factors that drive the viability of solar energy are ample sunlight, cost of project and interest of individual households to use solar energy The most important factor for solar energy to work is ample sunlight. Given the geographical location of India this is not at all an issue.  The issue that has been a major constraint in the past is the cost. But recent studies ( India Ratings and Research  (Ind-Ra) ) suggests solar power could become as cheap as conventional thermal energy over the next two to three years and reach Rs 4-4.5 per unit by FY18  .  This is driven by a decline in capital costs for solar modules and other balance of plant equipment, an increase in efficiency, a shift towards large solar photovoltaic projects leading to the economies of scale and lower return expectations by developers.  Also India has  signed  a Memorandum of Understanding with Germany ‚Äúto expand bilateral development cooperation in the field of solar energy by increasing use of solar energy in India through technical as well as financial cooperation‚Äù.As a part of this MoU, Germany ‚Äúwould provide concessional loans"" to help in this cause. The Indian government has announced a goal of achieving 100GW of solar capacity by 2022. For a country with only 240GW of power in total currently 100 GW is a big number. But this is achievable. One major thing that is lacking is planning from government.  India will need to increase its pace of renewable energy capacity addition seven times, from an average 3GW/year to 20+GW/year. For this to happen serious overhaul of the power infrastructure as well as new incentives to drive investment is required. Microfinance need to be done on large scale in rural areas to increase their participation.  Awareness levels have to be increased to larger extent to bring on participation of people from all the sections of society, after all using solar is not only for our power requirements but it is also our moral responsibility.

Solar Energy,Which is the best method to use solar energy more efficiently?,"I think the post installation operation and maintenance plays and important role in increasing the efficiency of solar plant. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ‚Äì THE KEY SUCCESS FACTOR FOR A SOLAR PV POWER PLANT The solar PV plants in India are entering a phase of maturity. The total installations will exceed 2 GW by the end of the year, and about half of them would have completed more than 1 year of operations by that time. As the plant becomes older, Operation and Maintenance (O&M) becomes more and more important for improving the performance of the plant. In this article, some of the important aspects of O&M are highlighted. A few challenges related to them and some solutions are suggested. Types of Maintenance
 Like in any power plant, a solar PV plant requires the following types of maintenance Preventive Maintenance (PM) which includes routine inspection and servicing of equipment which help prevent breakdowns and reduce energy yield losses. PM is usually a scheduled activity. Corrective Maintenance(CM) or breakdown Maintenance(BM) includes repair of broken down equipment and is usually reactive. Condition-Based Monitoring(CBM)involves monitoring of equipment condition and plant operations on a real-time basis and addresses a potential problem at a very early stage to prevent downtime. This requires a robust plant performance monitoring system. O&M focus areas
A solar PV power plant has several components and each of the sub-system requires different O&M skillsets. A few of the sub-systems and their O&M requirements are mentioned below. Module
 While the PV module does not have any moving parts, the yield from the module is highly dependent on the cleaning of the panels. In the dusty environments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the cleaning frequency has to be quite high. Electrical sub-systems
 Inverter is the most complicated component of the PV plant and can be called the heart of the system. Since Inverters are predominantly electronics devices, they need to be taken very high care due to the extreme hot, humid and dusty conditions of India. World over, the system downtime is very closely correlated to the inverter downtimes. In fact, in a study conducted in 2010 by US based Electric Power Research Institute, the number of breakdowns is the highest by inverters. From the above graph, it can be noticed that most of the energy losses happen due to the AC Sub-systems. Apart from this, it is also important to periodically check the wiring(using visual inspection and if possible, using infrared scanners). In India, rodents are known to cause damages to the underground cables and it is important to monitor this regularly. Earthing protection also needs to be checked often. Civil and Structural sub-systems
 One of the tasks of the O&M personnel will be make sure that the growth of shrubs and other vegetation are fully in control. If not, they will grow very tall and will cause shadowing effect on the panels. Snakes and other poisonous reptiles might make these shrubs their home and can cause safety hazard to the workers. The other problems relate to the mounting structures. In some cases, bending of the structures can happen due to the improper design. If left unaddressed, the bending can damage the modules.
Similarly, during rainy season, it has been observed that the top soil gets washed away due to improper drainage system. Caving of the foundation and the structures caused by improper compaction of the ground has also been observed. A pro-active O&M team can address this by visual inspection and take preventive action especially before rains. Communication
 Most of the solar power plants are located in remote places with unreliable communication infrastructure. Most of the remote monitoring systems need an internet connection and in the absence of a reliable connection, there could be problems of lack of data logging for long periods of time. This makes it very difficult to diagnose and rectify problems in a timely manner. Warranty Management
 The O&M personnel should have a very clear understanding of the warranty terms from the suppliers. They also need to know the type of defects or problems that are covered under warranty, the duration of the warranty and also the key personnel from the supplier with whom warranty claims can be taken up and enforced in a timely manner. Spare Parts Inventory Management
 The inventory management is critical because this could increase or decrease the cost of the O&M as well as the working capital requirement. It is also essential for the timely completion of the different types of maintenance. The O&M personnel should know very clearly the list of the spare parts available, their quantity at the site warehouse and the lead times for delivery of spare parts from the suppliers. OTHER CHALLENGES In our experience in India so far, we have come across some of the problems which are very severe. O&M budget ‚Äì Typically, the O&M budgets are very limited for various reasons. Availability of water ‚Äì Dust accumulation in India is very high and requires frequent cleaning. However, most of the plants are located in arid regions with very little availability of water. Skilled manpower ‚Äì Since the O&M involves people who have the skills in electrical and electronics engineering, it is a challenging task to get people to move to such remote locations to work. Local labour ‚Äì In many places, it is mandated that local villagers need to be employed for O&M. While this is a noble objective and also is important for the economic development of local communities, in some cases the locals form unions and demand wages that make the O&M cost to go very high. Theft ‚Äì Theft of materials (even PV panels) is rampant in some parts of the country. This can be prevented by having a good security system and a good inventory management system. Documentation ‚Äì In many plants, there is no robust remote monitoring system. Instead they have a basic SCADA system which provides real-time information, but does not log the events, alarms and other maintenance issues. In such cases, there is very little documentation which can help the O&M personnel to identify, diagnose and trace the problems. CONCLUSION The importance of O&M is often overlooked by many developers. Considering the fact that the plant has to generate returns over a period of 25 years, a good O&M contractor, a good monitoring system and above all, a very good O&M process is very critical for the success of the plant.

Solar Energy,What are the bad sides of solar energy?,"Intermittency has been mentioned, but I'd like to express the massive implicit subsidy on renewables this is.  Renewables (without storage) give the grid crappy, unreliable power with  no inertia .  So not only do the *other* generators have to continually compensate for the variation, but when there's an extreme event on the grid, solar can't help the grid hold on until mitigation efforts (primary and secondary response) can take place. Fossil fuel plants do this by literally having tons of spinning metal that is hard to slow down.  So when a big nuclear plant trips out, it takes 10 seconds for the fequency to drop to an unacceptable level, as opposed to 2.  That 10 seconds is enough for other actors to come in and help.  2 is not, and the result could well be a blackout. Storage will help with this, but only when coupled with next-generation control architectures including, hopefully, simulated inertia.  Until then, increased renewable penetration will come at an ever greater cost on the grid.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-bad-sides-of-solar-energy,"So is there a market for inertia?  That is, really, really fast but short-term electrical storage? Imagine that I built an electric motor, with a control system which could smoothly and instantly convert it into a generator, driving a really big flywheel.  I spin it up so that's it's synchronous to 60 Hz.  If a nuclear plant trips off, or if the sun goes behind a cloud, frequency starts to fall but the flywheel/generator resists and supplies a gigawatt or so for a little while, maybe 10 to 30 seconds. My guess is that such a thing could be built for $0.10/watt, which is about what a midsize AC motor costs. $0.10/watt is not a lot to add to a PV system, as they are so ridiculously expensive.  It would be a bit of a problem for a wind farm, but they probably don't need it as much since they should already have plenty of inertia.","I agree with what you're saying, but, You're coming at it from a centralised perspective. Solar by nature will be decentralised and distributed. There isn't the need for as much inertia in a distributed network.","I think storage with inertia is already here. I recently read that a Spanish CSP farm of 20MW named Gemasolar powered the grid for 36 daysx24hr non stop thanks to its salt storage technology. Unfortunately it is still very expensive, but as far as I know the costs are going down as I write. If this can be generalized, do you see any reason why solar couldn't be a big hit shortly?",So can we expect it to be a viable option if heat energy storage methods and devices are successfully developed?,

Actually, all countries are using it as during the summer, although it is indirect, the water get heated by the sun. This is the Solar energy.

Crypto Currency,Are there any crypto currency hedge funds?,"Yes, there are currently over 100 crypto-asset hedge funds. (I say crypto-assets, because not all token/coins are a replacement for currency.) Funds are broadly broken out into two buckets. Let‚Äôs call them the Wall St. bucket and the Silicon Valley bucket. The Wall St. bucket funds focus on day trading, arbitrage between exchanges, momentum and other behavioral factors where a profit is to be made due to short-term price movements. These funds focus on earning a little bit with each trade. They could be trading anything that is volatile. The Silicon Valley bucket focuses on the long-term nature of crypto projects and their ability to gain traction and disrupt industries. Like venture capitalists, these investors are looking for 10x to 100x on their investment. The liquid nature of crypto assets provides an added benefit in that if the long-term projections of a particular project don‚Äôt go as planned, the assets could potentially be sold and re-invested in other more promising assets. There is a third bucket as well‚Ä¶ An index approach that simply buys a large number of crypto assets and holds them in some predetermined proportion.

Solar Energy,Can you briefly describe how electricity is generated from solar energy?," The roof system In most solar systems, solar panels are placed on the roof. An ideal site will have no shade on the panels, especially during the prime sunlight hours of 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.; a south-facing installation will usually provide the optimum potential for your system, but other orientations may provide sufficient production. Trees or other factors that cause shading during the day will cause significant decreases to power production. The importance of shading and efficiency cannot be overstated. In a solar panel, if even just one of its 36 cells is shaded, power production will be reduced by more than half. Experienced installation contractors such as NW Wind & Solar use a device called a Solar Pathfinder to carefully identify potential areas of shading prior to installation. Not every roof has the correct orientation or angle of inclination to take advantage of the sun's energy. Some systems are designed with pivoting panels that track the sun in its journey across the sky. Non-tracking PV systems should be inclined at an angle equal to the site‚Äôs latitude to absorb the maximum amount of energy year-round. Alternate orientations and/or inclinations may be used to optimize energy production for particular times of day or for specific seasons of the year. Solar panels Solar panels, also known as modules, contain photovoltaic cells made from silicon that transform incoming sunlight into electricity rather than heat. (‚ÄùPhotovoltaic‚Äù means electricity from light ‚Äî photo = light, voltaic = electricity.) Solar photovoltaic cells consist of a positive and a negative film of silicon placed under a thin slice of glass. As the photons of the sunlight beat down upon these cells, they knock the electrons off the silicon. The negatively-charged free electrons are preferentially attracted to one side of the silicon cell, which creates an electric voltage that can be collected and channeled. This current is gathered by wiring the individual solar panels together in series to form a solar photovoltaic array. Depending on the size of the installation, multiple strings of solar photovoltaic array cables terminate in one electrical box, called a fused array combiner. Contained within the combiner box are fuses designed to protect the individual module cables, as well as the connections that deliver power to the inverter. The electricity produced at this stage is DC (direct current) and must be converted to AC (alternating current) suitable for use in your home or business. Inverter The inverter is typically located in an accessible location, as close as practical to the modules. In a residential application, the inverter is often mounted to the exterior sidewall of the home near the electrical main or sub panels. Since inverters make a slight noise, this should be taken into consideration when selecting the location. The inverter turns the DC electricity generated by the solar panels into 120-volt AC that can be put to immediate use by connecting the inverter directly to a dedicated circuit breaker in the electrical panel. The inverter, electricity production meter, and electricity net meter are connected so that power produced by your solar electric system will first be consumed by the electrical loads currently in operation. The balance of power produced by your solar electric system passes through your electrical panel and out onto the electric grid. Whenever you are producing more electricity from your solar electric system than you are immediately consuming, your electric utility meter will turn backwards! Net meter In a solar electric system that is also tied to the utility grid, the DC power from the solar array is converted into 120/240 volt AC power and fed directly into the utility power distribution system of the building. The power is ‚Äúnet metered,‚Äù which means it reduces demand for power from the utility when the solar array is generating electricity ‚Äì thus lowering the utility bill. These grid-tied systems automatically shut off if utility power goes offline, protecting workers from power being back fed into the grid during an outage. These types of solar-powered electric systems are known as ‚Äúon grid‚Äù or ‚Äúbattery-less‚Äù and make up approximately 98% of the solar power systems being installed today. Other benefits of solar By lowering a building‚Äôs utility bills, these systems not only pay for themselves over time, they help reduce air pollution caused by utility companies. For example, solar power systems help increase something called ‚Äúpeak load generating capacity,‚Äù thereby saving the utility from turning on expensive and polluting supplemental systems during periods of peak demand. The more local-generating solar electric power systems that are installed in a given utility's service area, the less capacity the utility needs to build, thus saving everyone from funding costly additional power generating sources. Contributing clean, green power from your own solar electric system helps create jobs and is a great way to mitigate the pollution and other problems produced by electricity derived from fossil fuel. Solar-powered electrical generating systems help you reduce your impact on the environment and save money at the same time!",https://www.quora.com/Can-you-briefly-describe-how-electricity-is-generated-from-solar-energy,,,,,
Solar Energy,What is solar energy and how does it work?,"Solar power is electromagnetic radiation emitted by SOL our sun it can be captured and used to create electricity or hot water These are the 2 most common uses. So I will leave it at that. Enough solar energy Hits this planet 84 Tera Watts every 24 hrs We only use 12 tera watts a day worldwide .So the potential for this energy as you can see is huge. Free energy without using oil, wood,coal, nuclear or any other form of pollution causing energy. It's out there it's ours and it's free it would be a lifesaver for the planet. And raise the living standards in third world countries greatly just one example being the huge amount of water that could be sterilised and made potable that alone would raise standards in third world countries to a far more acceptable level. We have the technology the skills and the material to implement this. But instead they wave the decoy duck of global warming at us.While squandering trillions of dollars on unjust Wars. While Blatently lying to our faces and saying these Wars are happening to protect us. The only things these wars are protecting are the Petro dollar and profit margins of secretive nefarious shadowy corporations. Corporations who profit from the deaths of Innocents. Along with brainwashing members of the Armed Forces to make them believe that what they are doing is patriotic and in the service of their country.If this money were used to harness solar energy correctly planet Earth's health would greatly Increase as the strain on the only Earth we have would be removed Sorry about this political rant but I used it to illustrate how great the potential for solar power is and how it is not being implemented for reasons unknown to the rest of the world .",https://www.quora.com/What-is-solar-energy-and-how-does-it-work,,,,,
Solar Energy,How can solar energy be profitable?,"Why Solar Panels Are Greatly Profitable? The beauty about the solar industry is that we are relying on a source of energy that is providing us more energy than our planet even needs. Our current objectives and mission are being able to effectively utilize this energy and to have it replace many forms of expensive, inefficient, and harmful electricity generating methods. What I love about the solar industry, and why I decided to devote my life to helping grow my company is because  it‚Äôs a ‚Äòwin-win‚Äô for everyone. No one loses.  And with the countless amounts of benefit‚Äôs, it seems hard to believe how it wouldn‚Äôt be a profitable investment for anyone. Below I have listed them in terms of consumers, businesses, and our planet. Consumer Profitability: Electricity Costs:  Depending on where you currently live will determine how much solar energy you will receive and how much it can reduce your energy costs. The most widely known and promoted solar program currently available is called ‚ÄúNet-Metering‚Äù whereby you install enough solar panels to reduce your energy costs to net $0. The cost of the system per month is always less than your current monthly hydro so you are never paying more per month (No-Cost Solar Program). Monthly Revenue:  Although not offered everywhere, some countries and cities offer the ability for property owners to generate monthly income based on the energy they produce. This is known as microFIT (Under 10kW) or FIT (Over 10kW). Sometimes government programs offer both Net-metering and FIT which reduce your electricity costs and generate your revenue based on the excess energy produced. A lot of countries are installing solar farms because of the amount of revenue they can produce for themselves. Properties Value:  Now this will greatly depend on your areas economic position, size of the solar system, and current demand for solar in your area. But normally both residential & commercial property owners can increase the value of their business by 11-25% just by installing solar panels. The reason for this is because you are locked in a fixed electricity rate and no longer must pay for increasing electricity costs. Tax Benefits & Government Rebates:  Depending on where you live the Government is helping reduce the cost of the system either through rebates or through tax credits. For example, in Florida you receive a 30% Federal tax refund, and in Manitoba you receive a $1 back for every watt you install on your property. Mortgage & Insurance Benefits:  Also depends on where you currently live but Mortgage or Housing Corporations will often offer premium refunds or interest rate reductions by installing energy products such as solar in your home. Business Profitability: Manufacturers:  Manufacturing companies are profiting the most when it comes to the solar industry, especially the biggest leaders like Jinko and Canadian Solar. China seems to be providing the most cost effective and energy efficient solar panels so far and are selling their panels at wholesale prices to energy companies all around the world. Energy Companies:  Energy companies that are involved with installing solar panels on residential, or commercial properties can either produce income from their local utility or help power cities through large solar generators. Solar Installers : Also an economic advantage for providing more job opportunities in the renewable energy sector. Companies who create agencies that outsource solar installers to other energy companies profit greatly. Research & Development:  Universities & energy companies are spending millions all together to produce more energy efficient and cost effective solar panels in which they can sell these patents to suppliers & manufacturers through a licensing agreement. Generally, these companies profit through a royalty stream. Economic & Environmental Profitability: Economic Value:  The economic value of solar is extremely large particularly since it provides so many new job opportunities, and helps everyone‚Äôs financial situation (saves everyone money, and increases their properties value). Environmental Aspect:  The more we lean towards clean energy methods the more our environment benefits from it. This means less reasons to spend on expensive electricity generating methods and less expenses towards cleaning up harmful chemicals in our environment. Energy Replacement:  Because we are moving away from expensive, and harmful electricity producing methods everyone not only pays less for electricity but the actual production of electricity is far less as well.

Solar Energy,Is it possible to convert solar energy into electric energy?,"Via Photoelectric effect, which earned Einstein his Nobel Prize. To understand this, we need to go through about two years of electrical engineering graduation course. Physics Now, as you may know, Electrons have many possible energy levels, in or outside an atom. Electrons can emit/absorb photons(light) and change their energy levels. Sometimes, an element may adsorb and then emit photons, and this can be a complicated process since there are many energy levels.  Now, light (or rather, electromagnetic waves) has two basic proprieties. One is what we call color, though the propriety is actually frequency. The other basic propriety is  intensity . Light is made of photons. Think of light as an immeasurable amount of little balls with no mass flying at light-speed. The frequency is the energy each photon has, while intensity is the energy of all those balls have. Now, what Einstein discovered is that when a photon reacts with an electron, this happen in a one-to-one basis. That is, electrons change their energy level by emitting or absorbing a single photon. Each photon energy (in eV) is the photon‚Äôs frequency multiplied by the Plank Constant. This is the experiment.  You have a battery, an amperemeter and a vacuum tube. This tube has two pieces of metals connected to the wires and nothing between them. Without light, this is an open circuit. With strong red light, this is an open circuit. With a weak UV light, the circuit closes. What happens is that UV light has enough energy to rip electrons from the metal plate, creating free electrons inside the tube which will then follow the electric force generated by the metal plates, flowing from one end to the other and closing the circuit. This is the photoelectric effect:  high energy photons create free electrons. This is the basic physical knowledge you must have in order to understand solar energy. Now let‚Äôs talk a bit about materials. Materials A Solar cell is an electrical component called diode. Diodes are p-n semiconductor junctions.  STOP! We need to go back a little. As far as electrical proprieties are concerned, there are three types of materials: Conductors, semiconductors and insulators. The difference between them is the electron energy levels.  Electrons have many energy levels. When they are trapped in a atom, they are inside the Valence Band. When they can move freely through the material, they are in the conductive band. The more freedom an electron has, more energy it has. Now, it‚Äôs easy for the electron inside a conductor to move to the conductive band; it requires just a bit of energy since the conductive and valence band overlaps. But for semiconductors and insulators, there‚Äôs something called  band gap,  which is a band of energy where there is no energy level for this material. For practical purposes, we can say that the band-gap is the energy required for an electron to go from the topmost valence level to the lowest conducting level. Spoiler: For photons to create free electrons, they need to have an energy level higher than the band gap Now, you may see that a semiconductor has a lower band-gap than insulators. This means semiconductors are terrible conductors and very bad insulators. And that‚Äôs why they are awesome. You see, we learned that we could bombard semiconductors with other elements and modify their conducting proprieties. We call this  doping , and the doping element is either an electron donator or receiver. This will make the semiconductor  p ositive , or  n egative. OK, now we can go back to our diode. Diodes are P-N junctions, that is, a piece of semiconductor that has been bombarded by receivers in some parts and donators in others, creating free electrons and holes in our semi-conductor. Btw, a  hole  is the absence of an electron. In electrical engineering, we consider holes as ‚Äúpositive electrons‚Äù because the atoms have this habit of stealing each other electrons, making the hole move. Now, as you might imagine, when there are free electrons and holes in the interface between conductors, the free-electrons will fill the holes. Since they are on the conductance band, they need to release energy to fit the hole (so to speak). Meaning they emit photons to fit in.  Have you ever heard of  LED s? You know,  L ight  E mitting  D iodes? They work by doing this continuously. They are the exact opposite of Photovoltaic cells. Anyway, in regular diodes, this create an interesting effect. When atoms lose/receive electrons  they are no longer electrically neutral.  Since, unlike charge carriers(electrons/holes), atoms are struck in their crystalline structure and so they stay there, creating a potential barrier. After some time passes, this potential barrier grows strong enough to stop electrons/holes from flowing through it, stopping the recombination. We call this ionized region  depletion layer.  Most of the interesting things with semi-conductors happen by manipulating this depletion layer. By the way, now you can understand the diagram I showed you earlier.  And now we can talk about photovoltaic cells.  Actually, I already explained everything. Photons hit electrons, create electrons/holes pair and‚Ä¶ we have electrical current. That‚Äôs how we convert solar energy to electrical energy. At least with PV, of course. The other way is just use solar energy to boil water, use the steam to apply torque to a turbine that turns the rotor of a synchronous generator. Boring.

Solar Energy,Who is first inventor of solar energy?,"Straight of the web Solar power has a surprisingly long history. As far back as 7000 BC, people could use different materials to magnify the sun‚Äôs rays in order to start a fire. By the time of the ancient Romans, people had learned to construct ‚Äúsunrooms‚Äù with large widows that directed the sunlight to a given area. People still build houses with sunrooms today. The French scientist Edmond Becquerel (1820 ‚Äì 1891) is sometimes credited with the invention of the solar cell. He discovered the photovoltaic effect while still a teenager in 1839 by coating platinum electrodes with a silver compound and exposing them to light and thus generating electricity. During the 1870s, several different scientists found that the element selenium could also create electricity after being exposed to sunlight. The American inventor Charles Fritts (1850 ‚Äì 1903) used wafers of selenium to make solar cells in 1883. A year later, he installed the world‚Äôs first solar array on the roof of a building in New York City. That solar array, unfortunately, only had an electrical conversion efficiency of about 1 percent. That means only about 1 percent of the sunlight that hit the array actually became electricity. Improving the efficiency of solar panels to make them a feasible energy technology has taken decades of research and work. In 2016, researchers at the University of South Wales developed solar panels with an electrical conversion efficiency of 34.5 percent. Modern solar cells, however, are made from silicon rather than selenium. Bell Labs began researching the possibility of using solar cells for outer space exploration sometime in the 1950s. Three of their scientists, Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin, successfully developed a silicon photovoltaic cell in 1954. It had an electrical conversion efficiency of about 4 percent. As miniscule as that efficiency was, the Bell Labs solar panel was the first solar cell that could power an electric device for several hours at a time. Consequently, many people consider the Bell Labs scientists to be the true inventors of solar panels. Some of earliest solar panels were used in outer space. In 1958, the US Navy launched Vanguard I, which was the first satellite to use solar power. It had a small solar panel that provided electricity to its radios. Six years later, NASA launched the first Nimbus satellite, which ran entirely on solar power provided by a 470-watt array. In 1973, the Institute of Energy Conversion (IEC) at the University of Delaware built Solar One, an experimental house in Newark that used solar power to provide both electricity and heat. Karl B√∂er, a physicist from Germany, had founded the IEC and oversaw Solar One‚Äôs construction. Under his leadership, IEC developed thin-film photovoltaics and was the first laboratory to achieve an electrical conversion efficiency of 10 percent.",https://www.quora.com/Who-is-first-inventor-of-solar-energy,,,,,
Fake News,Why do so many people believe in fake news?,"Recent events in Hong Kong made me wonder this as well. A question came up, why did ordinary citizens support the Nazi regime throughout the Holocaust? Propaganda. Hitler knew he couldn‚Äôt succeed with blunt force, so he tried another approach. In Mein Kamph, Hitler argues that Germany lost WWI because the British had better propaganda. Although patently untrue, it eventually became the official truth of the Nazis. His tactics are still used today, and we can see them raging on in Hong Kong. An alarming amount of people believe the police gang raped protesters, murdered civilians in the MTR or that China can extradite and kidnap citizens without a thorough judicial procedure. Mein Kampf, Chapter 6, ‚ÄúPropaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of people. All propaganda must be presented in a popular form and must fix its intellectual level so as not to be above the heads of the least intellectual of those to whom it is directed.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses. The broad masses of the people are not made up of diplomats or professors of public jurisprudence nor simply of persons who are able to form reasoned judgment in given cases, but a vacillating crowd of human children who are constantly wavering between one idea and another.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober reasoning. This sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple and consistent. It is not highly differentiated but has only the negative and positive notions of love and hatred, right and wrong, truth and falsehood.‚Äù Hitler was a genius in controlling mass perception. He followed a few simple rules to ensure success: 1. Propaganda must not investigate objective truth but appeal only to the theoretical aspects of justice favorable to the Nazis. 2. Capitalize on the receptive powers and short memories of the masses. Express the bare minimum in stereotypical formulas. Stubbornly repeating these slogans until the entire population is conditioned. 3. Every variance of such propaganda must always arrive at the same conclusion. Throughout the 1920-30‚Äôs, Hitler began to infiltrate every social structure with propaganda for anti-Semitism, euthanasia and Nuremberg laws. Funny enough, Hitler blamed the Jews for robbing German people of their jobs (Trump). He convinced the public the Jews were responsible for spreading Communism while promoting Nazi democracy. That the Jews were subhuman. Newspaper propaganda slandered Jews for kidnapping small children before Passover because they needed the blood of a Christian child ‚Ä¶ etc etc. This may seem absurd to you now. But Hitler was able to unify both Nationalists and Socialists. He then turned Germany democracy into his own German dictatorship. You don‚Äôt even have to be uneducated to believe in propaganda. I always believed that the bigger the lie, the easier it is for people to believe. People believe in what they want to believe in, or whatever is convenient for them. Not to mention that the speed information travels at means that misinformation spreads at the same rate. A friend showed me a few pieces of propaganda from March, three months before the protests began. It‚Äôs safe to say that this was planned well ahead, the terrorists out there have advanced ways to communicate and each attack orchestrated is swift and deadly. It‚Äôs quite easy to push someone past event horizon if they already have decades of bias towards an issue. So I would say fake news is easily debunked. Like people on average eat 10 spiders a year. But fake news propagated correctly targeted at a specific group of people quickly becomes their version of the truth.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-so-many-people-believe-in-fake-news,,,,,
Fake News,Is fake news dangerous?,"Fake news is the new  Frankenstein's  monster of our times.

Many of us has read about the story of Frankenstein which is the story of Victor Frankenstein and his obsession with creating life. But after his creation (monster) killed his wife, he regrets it and sets out to destroy the monster to make the world a safe place. Fast forward to present times, a political party obsessed with winning elections let the Frankenstein monster of fake news out as they intend to hugely benefit from it. Other political parties simply jumped in on the bandwagon coz it was too tempting not to. The very same political party  partly  riding high on fake news came to power. Their obsession with fake news didn't entirely end there but certainly went down a bit. Now that particular political party has formed the govt. While now they still have something to gain by fake news which can be used as means to amplify their achievements multifold but they have much to lose too if their good governance efforts are turned down by the fake news spread by other parties. So this political party's govt has actually started actively calling out such fake news using newly created FactCheck portals. Just like the original story script, arguably as a creationist of fake news monster, now they have started regretting it and have a plan in place to call out such fake news (destroy the monster). Who would have thought that the thing created to help them win elections would become an albatross around their neck when in governance?

Fake News,Does Indian Media spread fake news?,"  Someone has  said quite right,  ‚ÄúDemolition Men, Never Build The Nations.‚Äù  So is the case with Indian Premier, Mr Modi, who is bent upon to demolish everything that Indians once boasted and took proud of themselves on their unity and diversity of culture. The Prime Minister, who has spent his entire political career demolishing law, morality and the bonds of unity that unite Indians with each other now seemingly torn into shreds. One could see the BJP‚Äôs victory of vandalism and destruction over renewal and regeneration, crime and illegality over law and justice, fiction and fabrication over reality and truth. Mr Modi has turned India into a nation of compulsive liars who now speak lie freely, openly, without need and without shame. The dominant  sections of Indian (Godi) media have helped the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to market enormous lies against its neighbours especially Pakistan. India‚Äôs belligerence  and its muscular policy towards Pakistan has been on the rise ever since Mr Modi became the Prime Minister. For years now, India has been consistently painting Pakistan as the source of instability in the region. Various governments in New Delhi have accused Pakistan of cross-border terrorism, while whitewashing their own policies of brute repression and human rights violations in India. For several reasons,  India has largely able to convince the international community about its narrative while Pakistan‚Äôs response suffered from credibility issues. The signs emanating from India project mal-intent. Bellicose rhetoric and threatening posturing from civil and military leaders across the border have sadly become a norm. Added to this is the pressure on the BJP government after the dismal failure of its attempt to control the situation in occupied Kashmir and the ongoing protests of millions of Farmers across the country especially in Punjab where the Sikhh community has totally blocked the Indian capital staging a sit in against the enactment of biased farming laws.  Couple of days ago,  an extensive investigation by a European group has come up with shocking revelations about an Indian network aggressively promoting disinformation with a dual goal to consolidate India‚Äôs power and image while pushing anti-Pakistan sentiment across the world by manipulating the media. The  EU DisinfoLab  found that this network has been working diligently against Pakistan since 2005. The mission of this Indian network was to discredit Pakistan and to get favourable support from international institutions such as the EU and the United Nation. The Indian Chronicles  attempts to create a negative impression of Pakistan through fake news that betrays sinister campaign which is beginning to define the conflict of our times. The  EU DisinfoLab‚Äôs  evidence-based analysis is led by the belief that citizens should be well-informed about the source of information and that they understand the context. This principle is key to preventing people from being manipulated, especially on media. Their stellar investigation should serve as a wake-up call for India to punish such actors who intentionally engage in disinformation and abuse of international institutions.  Now, it is the right time  for Pakistan to reverse the Indians fake narrative and make effective use of diplomacy and strategic communication to find international traction for the dossier it has unveiled earlier this month. Though the idea of India as a state sponsor of terrorism may be hard for the international community to digest, as it appears to be on a diet of slick Indian propaganda backed by the image that the country has crafted for itself, but this is exactly the challenge that Pakistan must accept. India should, however,  know by now that if it attempts to cross any red lines, the response is likely to be swift and hard, as demonstrated earlier in Feb-2019. For the sake of both countries, indeed the region itself, the international community should make India step back before it is too late.

Fake News,Does fake news exist?,"To be objective. Fake news is a term that Trump started using in the beginning of his presidency if not before. A good thing to review is specifically what Items has Trump truly called Fake news. The crowd size of his inauguration was small. He or no one in his campaign had any meetings with Russia. He didn‚Äôt know who Story Daniels was. When picture came out with Stormy he said that he takes pictues with 100s of people and that the picture doesn‚Äôt mean he knows her. That him having sex with Story was fake news. That him paying her off or knowing of the payoffs were fake news. He called it fake news that he fired Comey due to Russia investigation, then the interview showing him saying it was came out. Later said he was trapped to say that. He called it fake news that that there was any collusion with anyone, then when it was found Manafort colluded and shared proprietary data his public lawyer said ‚Äúcollusion is not a crime‚Äù He said it was fake news that he forced his son in law and daughter to get security clearances. Said he didn‚Äôt even know the president could do that. He said it was fake news that the tax cuts were only for the wealthy and corporations. So based on this very small sample of things that Trump has called fake news. This mans that ‚ÄúFake news‚Äù means factual news that is not positive about Trump. So fake news coming from Trump or a MAGA means a Fact.",https://www.quora.com/Does-fake-news-exist,"The crowd size of his inauguration was small.

Why would it be important for the news media to comment on the size of the crowd, expect to delegitimatize Trump presidency? That was the only reason why this was news. Sometimes, Trump dismisses irrelevant news as fake news. He or no one in his campaign had any meetings with Russia.

Yes, Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign had contacts with Russia assets. The extent of the contacts were a matter of debate. Russian intelligence is always trying to groom Western business people and politicians. Again, dismissed as irrelevant. He didn‚Äôt know who Story Daniels was.

He guy might have had an idea who she was, but would you real admit in public that you know stripper (I know my wife would be pissed). Again, really to delegitimatize Trump presidency. Nobody cares who he is screwing. When picture came out with Stormy he said that he takes pictures with 100s of people and that the picture doesn‚Äôt mean he knows her.

100% actuate. That him having sex with Story was fake news.

He probably never had sex with her. To be as nice as possible, in real life she is really short, heavy and not so good looking. Not his cup of tea. She screws super models. That him paying her off or knowing of the payoffs were fake news.

And he told Cohen to make it all legal. That is on tape. Make sure its legal. He called it fake news that he fired Comey due to Russia investigation, then the interview showing him saying it was came out. Later said he was trapped to say that.

No, the White House said that Comey was fired, Trump wasn‚Äôt trapped, he readily admitted it to Lester Holt. Despite being told not to by the same WH staff. He called it fake news that that there was any collusion with anyone, then when it was found Manafort colluded and shared proprietary data his public lawyer said ‚Äúcollusion is not a crime‚Äù

Manafort (a Democrat operative, who is his partner???) was around for a cup of coffee (a couple of weeks). Only to keep convention delegates in line. Was stripped of all his power then fired because of the crap he was doing in the Ukraine. He said it was fake news that he forced his son in law and daughter to get security clearances. Said he didn‚Äôt even know the president could do that.

There is a lady in WH human resources that was a holdover from the Obama administration (she is a partisan Democrat) same lady was involved in last episode with Ukraine.

Crypto Currency,What is the mission of crypto currencies?,"Cryptocurrencies are widely considered to be the most promising innovation that this generation has been trying to perfect or prefect in this economical frenzy of freedom. They are literally everybody‚Äôs last resort when it comes to serving everybody‚Äôs vested interests related to the widely believed nature of government bodies and their scrupulous urge to understand everything which they don‚Äôt even have to. Well, for the newbies, cryptocurrencies are designed to be digital assets protected by a strong cryptography and a mining algorithm that defines, controls and verifies the transactions happening on the time-stamped distributed ledger, usually known as blockchain. Mission of Cryptocurrencies: To provide an alternative channel for everybody to flourish under a truly globalised and populist approach of financial assertion and transparency paradigm. This is essentially sought after by the people who vow to be economically free by fleeing from too much interference in the case of democratic and monarchy governments that reserve the sole authority of regulations and flow of money in the system. The cryptocurrencies aim to replenish the financial expectations of the masses, which have been largely undermined or overlooked by the moderatory bodies who claimed to suffice the need of the people but somehow failed to deliver. However, the inception of cryptocurrencies shall pave the way for a single phenomenon to transact, exchange and define the actions, methodology and adequacy in terms of what it should be, how it has been and why is it different? Belief of Cryptocurrencies: The former vision and aim were specifically catered to address major world problems, however, after the moderate adulterations of that prospect with crony capitalism and/or to suffice the tendency of inexplicable gains, a major disparity has been created in the views of the experts. Some believe that capitalism has rendered the cryptocurrency fabric a much needed widespread audience that they are in dire need/hope for, however, some see it as an opportunistic inclination just gambling or hovering over the future of the most prolific innovation of this century. The truth, otherwise, is none of them all, cryptocurrencies are here to suffice the need of the hour, however, too much crypto has a tendency to swing both ways, as the last thing we ever want to read about is scamsters, imposters and constant hacks in our daily newspaper. The Hype Hype of a project is never a new finding in our daily lifestyle, as we tend to believe in everything we want to or hope to be true and almost everything that creates intrigue. Is it viable? That‚Äôs a debate for another timeline, but today, cryptocurrencies are very much real and have taken this financial world by storm, with over 4000 of them flocking around in the system. If there is a hype, and if there is a promise, there must be some motive behind it, but it would be too early to comment otherwise. As cryptocurrencies and people as a whole, still have a lot to learn and gain out of it. Vishal writes‚úçÔ∏è..",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-mission-of-crypto-currencies,,,,,
Crypto Currency,Will cryptos die?,"Not a chance. Yes SOME will die, but the cryptocurrency phenomena is not a phenomena anymore. Cryptocurrency is not only ‚Äúinternet 5.0‚Äù but ‚Äúmoney 3.0‚Äù or more‚Ä¶ We are witnessing the ‚ÄúGreat Shaking of the Tree‚Äù right now. Many of the pump and dump cryptos will die, and as far as I‚Äôm concerned not fast enough (!), and the good ones, the ones that actually solve a problem will stay. THEY WILL STAY FOREVER, because they truly are the future of money, and the internet at the same time. Keep your eyes and ears open for Microsoft Azure. This is the Blockchain based technology from Microsoft that wants to solve the problem of centralized cloud storage. In other words: it is Microsoft‚Äôs FIRST DECENTRALIZED and blockchain based cloud storage solution. (Actually it is much more than that, but you can just go to their website and see for yourself.) Indeed many of the applications we will never see, we will use them and not even know we are using them. Amazon is also working on decentralized cloud storage,  the End User won‚Äôt even know it when he/she uses it! JP Morgan are working on their own financial blockchain called  QUORUM. I think that is worth repeating: one of the biggest financial players in the world is making their own blockchain.  THAT  my friends is why you hear their CEO talking bad about bitcoin; he‚Äôs bad-mouthing the competition! There are already Bitcoin credit cards that are accepted wherever Visa and the others are.  Indeed Bitcoin has already reached the  event horizon  and is now TOO BIG TO FAIL. Bitcoin‚Äôs market value is now more than General Electric‚Äôs, and Morgan Stanley‚Äôs! At $160 Bln, Bitcoin's Market Cap is Larger Than That of Once World's Largest Company Bitcoin's market value is now larger than Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley But it‚Äôs not just the marketcap that is so important. It is the BILLIONS of dollars, Yen, Juan, Rubles, Pesos, etc etc. that are now flowing into it. And even more than that, it is the entire sum of the people who are putting their trust and hard earned money into all cryptocurrencies. So this is my answer when noobs ask ‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶what‚Äôs backing it up?‚Äù A: Billions of dollars and billions of people who have invested in it. JUST LIKE the Dollar or any other currency. Q: Why are they so powerful? Let‚Äôs put all of the geek tech.answers aside.  Cryptos are so powerful because they are the first money that YOU actually own. 100% You think you own your gold? Think again, someone like FDR can come by and confiscate it and make YOU a criminal for wanting to keep your gold:  Executive Order 6102 - Wikipedia Cypress (2012‚Äì2013)  is another good example, don‚Äôt even think for a second that you own ‚Äúyour‚Äù money in the bank. The weakness right now of all cryptocurrencies is that they are on a network+infrastructure (satellites, telephone lines etc.) that is owned by the government.  THAT is the next challenge. Until then, I recommend you read ANYthing by James Altucher about bitcoin, and also  Nassim Taleb, this for example:  Bitcoin ‚Äì Opacity ‚Äì Medium Again, we are in the early stages right now and we are shaking the tree.

Tech Scalpers,Is it better to move to Canada as a Permanent Resident instead of staying in US on H1B?,"This is a very good question because it will be much more difficult to get an H1B in future. First, now more than ever, you need a qualified US immigration lawyer who monitors the changes day by day. I am a US lawyer and a Canadian lawyer but even I hire immigration lawyers when I bring a foreign employee to the US. You need a pro. It is a mistake to do this yourself. Second, if you can qualify for a different class of visa - give it a try. Obviously non-quota visas are the most desirable. Getting quota-based visas will require speed and agility. There are lots of applicants and the quota is going to be distributed really quick. (It is gong to be worse than trying to get tickets to Hamilton and there are no scalpers for visas). Third - how much risk makes you uncomfortable? This is a personal decision. If you cannot sleep - get a Canadian work authorization now. The Canadian government just announced that they will expedite the process for work authorization for Tech workers in just a few weeks. I live in Canada. It is wonderful, polite and clean. It warmly accepts new immigrants and has good healthcare that covers everyone. (If you come, buy a warm coat and start to like ice hockey). Canada is building high tech hubs to accommodate the many qualified foreign works with US visa issues. On the other hand, if you are comfortable with the stress of possibly not getting an HIB renewal in future, then wait it out in the US to see if you actually have a problem.

Tech Scalpers,"If HFT is high-tech scalping, is it possible to work for HFTs satisfied with your contribution to society?","HFT is not ""high-tech scalping"". I would actually call it high-tech anti-scalping"". Let me give you and example with ticket scalping. The Lakers are coming to town, and being Kobe's last game, you want to see him play in your city for the last time. All tickets are sold out, so if you want to go to the game you probably have to go through scalpers. you want to pay $150, but the cheapest is $200. You can wait to see if the price comes down, but if you want the tickets  now , your only choice is to shell out $200. Conversely, if you want to sell tickets, you can probably sell it for $150 immediately, or you can wait around and see if anyone will buy it for $200.  In the above example, the market is  inefficient . There is a $50 spread between the price buyers want to pay and the price sellers want to sell.  This is similar to what the financial markets used to be before HFT.  There is a high cost to trading. You lose the spread each time you buy and sell, and that money goes directly into the pockets of Wall St broker dealers. They made huge profits. With the development of automated trading, high frequency traders were able to undercut the old-fashioned Wall St traders by offering better prices. So now, buyers can buy their tickets to the game for say $155 from high frequency traders. Sellers can sell them for $145. Sure, high frequency traders make $10 from that transaction, but the problem of offloading those tickets got passed to them. Everyone wins in this scenario: you paid $45 less for the tickets that you want, and the high frequency traders made $10 (minus the cost to offload their new positions). Who loses? The old Wall St trader who wanted $200 for those tickets. Coincidentally, they're the ones who have been complaining the most about the rise of HFT... So I hope this example helps you realize that HFT is not scalping. Thanks to HFT, individuals like you and I are paying the lowest fees ever when buying and selling financial products. And yes, that means more money saved in your 401k. This phenomenon has forced many old-school Wall St traders out of business by offering prices as close to the fair price as possible. Now I won't talk about whether or not this constitutes as a ""contribution to society"", as the other author already provided a good answer. Now, I don't think high frequency traders are out there saving lives, but contrary to what people think, they're not out there scalping people either. I hope I was able to make that point clear.",https://www.quora.com/If-HFT-is-high-tech-scalping-is-it-possible-to-work-for-HFTs-satisfied-with-your-contribution-to-society,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,Why did Jeff Bezos personally buy The Washington Post?,"In two words:  paywall consolidation. There‚Äôs a business opportunity here and the analysis behind it is very similar to the analysis that led Bezos to create Amazon in the first place. Consider the situation we currently have.  People who want to read the contents of the WSJ, the NYT, and other publications that have paywalls have to sign up separately and pay for all of them individually even though that involves ridiculous duplication of content and redundant expense.  Most customers don‚Äôt want  more news .  They typically have only a certain, very limited, amount of time for reading news.  What they want is  more choice  and  better quality . So this is not about spending more to increase consumption, this is about spending more to increase choice and most people are very resistant to doing that.  How many people do you know who would be willing to pay for access to the news behind ten paywalls?  Twenty paywalls?  Thirty?  Very few, I‚Äôll wager.  In fact, most people refuse to subscribe at all, because the cost of a subscription is not justified by the limited selection of news it provides. People resent being forced to overpay and they resent having their choices artificially restricted.  Subscribing to the NY Times is like having to sign up for a year‚Äôs worth of arugula salad, lemon sole, and chocolate mousse.  No matter how much you might like those things, you don‚Äôt want that to be your only choice every day for a year.  Nor, if you want a lot of choices, do you want to have to pay for a year‚Äôs supply of every one of them, because you know you‚Äôre only going to use a small fraction of what you paid for. The Amazon Model
The advantage that Amazon has over a brick and mortar bookstore chain is not cost, per se.  It may or may not be cheaper to buy a book from Amazon than to by it from your local bookstore, but that‚Äôs almost irrelevant as long as the prices are reasonably close. What the customer gains by shopping on Amazon is choice, convenience, and confidence.  The customer‚Äôs not  necessarily  going to spend more money, although in general when people have more choices and more confidence, they will spend a little more.  But, as with news, most people have a limited amount of time in their lives for books. The real value is choice itself, the wide range of alternatives that a person can sample and explore.  And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs needed in the news business ‚Äì not little ghettos that have to be paid for one at a time. The Paywall Model
Imagine this:  instead of the current system of each individual newspaper handling its own subscribers, with its own paywall to keep non-subscribers out of its online content, you create a collective of newspapers, each receiving payments for online views of their content, with customers paying a single, slightly higher-than-average subscription fee for access to all of them.   The papers‚Äô costs go down, as they no longer need to administer their own paywalls and can reduce the amount of money they spend on duplicating other papers‚Äô work.  (I mean, seriously, do we really need a hundred reporters cranking out nearly identical stories about every routine political press conference?) Because the customer won‚Äôt have  time  to read all of that content, it‚Äôs not really being ‚Äúgiven away‚Äù ‚Äì and since each content-provider is being paid according to how many people actually  read  their content, it gives papers a high reward for producing good content that is relevant to their target audience.  From the customer‚Äôs point of view, this means not just vastly more choice, but more substance and higher quality. Notice how close this is to the Amazon model:  if you take an industry and reorganize it so that the value the customer receives is enormously increased, then volume and profits will follow. The Details
There are lots of possible business models, and many ways in which the funds within a paywall collective might be collected and disbursed.  The simplest model is for one person or company to start buying up money-losing papers and combining their content until there‚Äôs a critical mass that becomes attractive to subscribers even outside the local coverage areas of those papers.  At that point, most of the remaining big city papers will be forced to sell out or close down. Call this the monopolistic model.  No accounting is necessary, because there‚Äôs a single owner, but that owner will still want to know which writers, which editors, which brands, and which local news teams are getting the most readers, so we can assume that there will be internal record keeping of which content generates how many clicks and reads. The second alternative is the service bureau model, like ASCAP or BMI, in which the papers remain independent, but sign up with the consolidated paywall bureau. Each paper hustles to sign up subscribers and gets a certain percentage of each annual subscription it sells.  In addition, each paper gets a tiny amount each time any subscriber reads a story submitted by that paper. I‚Äôm sure there are other possibilities, but I suspect that we are headed for one of those two, and probably fairly soon.  And I suspect that it will be Jeff Bezos himself who decides which model we‚Äôre going to follow.  The first would take much more capital, but capital markets would probably be willing to fund it.  It would also inevitably lead to Bezos being cast as the rapacious capitalist and enemy of press freedom and diversity. The second approach would be both cheaper and friendlier.  Bezos would end up being cast as the savior of the big city newspaper in a digital age.  It would also be much more of a headache and would produce significantly less profit for Bezos himself.  Which he chooses to do is almost certainly going to be a personal decision, not primarily a financial one. But I have little doubt that he will do one or the other, or something similar.  That‚Äôs just the kind of mind he has.  He can‚Äôt look at a pre-digital industry and NOT see how much more value it could provide for the customer if it were reorganized from scratch. It‚Äôs been intriguing to watch the speculation about why Bezos bought the Post.  I thought from the very beginning that this answer was obvious.  I‚Äôve been very surprised to see that, after half a year of speculation, no one has suggested it.  It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see how it works out. And if this  isn‚Äôt  what Bezos had in mind when he bought the Post, it‚Äôs still what he  ought  to do with it.  As a news junky who refuses to pay paywall prices for access to a tiny slice of the news, I really want this to happen, and I‚Äôd be delighted to fork out the money to subscribe! I've got a more detailed post ( Why Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post ) on my blog,  Deep Systems .",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Jeff-Bezos-personally-buy-The-Washington-Post,I guess I'm a genius. I've been advocating for this shared paywall concept for YEARS.,"I totally agree that:
1) We need to start paying for content.
2) We don't want to limit our diet.
In fact I wrote about it a few months ago. Facebook's new monetization plan - content micropayments. I think the move towards much more paid services and content on the internet is bound to happen. I just don't for one moment think that buying a newspaper is the way to do it, papers are desperate for any money, if Amazon just offered a revenue share model for papers and became the structure that did the content distrution and payment, they'd succeed without all the crazy time and cost to go around buying papers.

Jeff Bezos,How did Jeff Bezos become so rich so fast?,"Jeff Bezos was born rich. So was Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Warren Buffet. None of them are rags to riches stories. But more like top 5% in the US to top 10 in the world. Just to give you an idea, Jeff Bezos‚Äô grandfather was one of the largest landowners in Texas. And most of them attended pricey Ivy-League universities such as Princeton, Harvard and Columbia at the undergrad level where scholarships are scarce. When Jeff Bezos started Amazon, his parents invested several X hundred thousand dollars into the startup. And that was in 1990s money, just to give you an idea of the wealth he comes from.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-Jeff-Bezos-become-so-rich-so-fast,"For most people, building wealth is a  multi-generational process . Many rich friends chose NOT use any of their parents money. But the  safety net of family wealth  provides means they can try & fail. My parents were middle-class when I was younger, and even that provided a massive safety net compared to working class friends. If I need $10K dental work, there‚Äôs no need to suffer in pain for a year . I don‚Äôt get $10 million loans/gifts to start a business, but if a business fails, family can (a) pay for an apartment for a year (b) buy a car (c) provide $25K-50K to find a job or start another business.
‚Äî‚Äî
I think the percentage of US people in the bottom 20% who make it into the top 20% (upper-middle-class, about $800,000 net worth) is  only 3% . A good challenge when growing up working class is making it to middle-class or upper-middle-class , so your kids can have a higher level safety net. ‚Äî‚Äî
A lot of very rich people who have kids who decide  other things are more important than money . So they  head downward on the income/wealth scale . Almost all of my Harvard classmates are NOT running billion-dollar companies. Why? Once they made something with 10‚Äì50 employees, had $200K-500K annual income, and $5M-20M net worth, ‚Ä¶. that was enough on the money side. At Harvard 35th reunions,  people retiring with $500K-2M were a little uncomfortable, but $2M-5M people felt ok. Doctors and other professionals tend to have about $5M-20M when they retire. Working-class or middle-class people might call this ‚Äúriches‚Äù, but it‚Äôs the high-end of upper-middle-class, or the very low end of ‚Äúnew rich‚Äù/‚Äùold rich‚Äù (HNWI, but not VHNWI). ‚Äî‚Äî-

Jeff Bezos,What is Jeff Bezos' workout routine?,"The man is in his 50‚Äôs. Why is this important? When you get to your 30‚Äôs your body starts producing less and less testosterone, and what do you need to build muscle? You guessed it,testosterone. If you compare his physique now to the one he had in his 20‚Äôs you see that he has gotten waaay bigger now.  How can you do this with less testosterone, when you should in fact be loosing muscle mass? TRT or Thestosterone Replacement Therapy. You basically go to a physician and he runs some blood tests to see what your testosterone levels are and if your levels are to low you get a weekly testosterone injection without overdoing it of course‚Ä¶ This is most likely what happened, so it‚Äôs not so much about what his workout is‚Ä¶the guy is ‚Äúkinda‚Äù taking steroids. This is how guys in their 50‚Äôs look better than they did in their 20‚Äôs.  One of the side effects is hair loss, but Bezos doesn‚Äôt need to worry about that.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-Jeff-Bezos-workout-routine,"This is grossly inaccurate. TRT will only bring you up to the upper limits of normal which is around 800‚Äì900 maybe a thousand. People on anabolic steroids for bodybuilding purposes take testosterone to get levels around 2,000‚Äì3,000 or higher. The kind of testosterone doses prescribed by a doctor which he would be taking would only bring his T levels up to what a Young male in his 20s would be producing naturally given he was exercising and eating properly. So his diet and his workout regimen would still matter greatly. As you can see most teenagers are fat and out of shape and their T levels are also around 700‚Äì900. Or at least would be if they weren't‚Äô facing pizza and ice cream daily while staying up till 4am playing COD everyday.","Bezos in the 90‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt look like a guy who had ever touched a weight. Bezos now looks like a guy with a few consistent years of training under his belt. Claiming that he had TRT is ridiculous without evidence. You don‚Äôt need TRT to get his results in your 50‚Äôs.

Tech Scalpers,What is the appropriate amount of time to spend while researching stocks?,"I wouldn't say that there is a definitive answer to that question because the amount of time you need is influenced by a couple of factors. If I could narrow these factors, I would say it depends on: Your investment method and goals: If you are a day trader or scalper, you have to make your decisions fast because that method relies on aggregating many small gains made during a short time span; therefore, you have to do your research quickly. On the other hand, if you are growth investor or someone who is interested in long-term capital gains, you will have to take longer to do your research because there are more moving parts to focus on eg. The macroeconomic climate, financials, etc.. On top of that, you have to come to peace with your decision because you may have to weather short-term adversity - which explains why you have to be extra-thorough. So, you can understand why Ted Weschler, investment manager at Berkshire Hathaway, takes 500 hours of research on average while a day trader can take minutes. The size of your investment: It's only natural for you to be more thorough when you are making a large investment as opposed to a smaller one because you stand to lose more if things go awry. And by size here, I mean the amount of money you are placing on the stock relative to the size of your portfolio. Your knowledge about the company or industry going in: If you have been investing in utilities but would like to diversify and buy tech stocks, you need more time to study the landscape if you are new to it (tech stocks). Fortunately, in this era of the internet, you can shorten the learning curve by utilizing the advice of trustworthy experts in the new industry. How experienced you are: When you are new to investing, you tend to take longer to research because you do not know where to look (for relevant information) when you are starting out. The ability to find information fast comes with experience. The size of the business whose stock you want to invest in; the bigger the business, the more the information you have to cover. Fundamental analysis vs. technical analysis. Fundamental will take longer than the technical analysis because you have to focus on qualitative parameters that are harder to measure. Which brings me to the next point... How readily available the information you are looking for is. For example, if the information you are seeking is not in the public domain, it will take longer to find. Your personality can also play a part. For example, if you are risk-averse, you will need to conduct more research to feel reassured in your decision. Your work ethic can also have an influence. As you can see, there is no appropriate time to spend researching on stocks but a few factors will influence it. Stock research could, therefore, take you minutes, hours, days, one week, one month, or more to eventually feel informed enough to make a decision and pull the trigger. Ultimately, you should take as much time as it takes for you to get comfortable and confident in the decision you make. Happy investing!",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-appropriate-amount-of-time-to-spend-while-researching-stocks,,,,,
Chip Shortage,When will the chip shortage end?,"I‚Äôd guess 6 months from now, but it‚Äôs dependent on how many wafers fabs are serious struggling with Covid regulations and how many were shut down for the Texas power disaster.

Age of Empires 4,Which features do you want in the next Age of Empire 4?,"This is a two part answer which will be broken up into two categories: what I want to see in the new game that was previously in the old (minus a few tweaks) as well as what was NOT in the old game, but would still have an ‚ÄúAge of Empires‚Äù feel to it.  WANTS  Immediately below is a list of what I do want to see in the future game (no matter how unlikely it is to happen) which were found to exist in earlier instalments: Shipments  The first time shipments were used in an Age of Empires game was when the third one was released in 2005. The shipments were unique in the sense that it allowed each player to create their own preferred deck of cards, which could be advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on the player‚Äôs preferred style of play and strategies. One problem I did, have, however, with the shipments, is that a player with a low level home city would be potentially at a disadvantage, especially if the opposing player with a higher home city was just as skilled if not more so than the player with the lower home city. A more fair form of playing in this regard, would be that every player can have access to any card they want and decide which ones to select into their playing deck. Another flaw to the strategy aspect of playing with decks, was that your own opponents could see which cards you had the moment you started playing. In a true strategy game relying on deception, such crucial information should not be so readily available to the opposing side, which brings me to my next point‚Ä¶ Score  In Age of Empires, when you are playing the game, you can see the score of yourself, your allies AND your opponents. The score effectively tells you how prestigious (or precarious) your situation is, based on available resources, upgrades and military strength, and the score readjusts every couple of seconds throughout the game. How are you supposed to be able to bluff your opponents and make them think you are stronger than you actually are if they can know what your score is the whole time? I mean, sure, I can see their score as well, but this drains the fun out of being able to intimidate your opponents into thinking you are in a much stronger position than you really are, which is how wars are won in real life as well. Wars have also been won by enemies pretending to be weak and crumbling in order to lure their enemies into their territory and ambush them and slaughter them, much like what Hannibal Barca did at Cannae in 216 BC. Rather than knowing the scores of our enemies from looking at the upper top right corner, may I suggest we at least prevent the actual scores of our opponents from being revealed until AFTER the game is completed? Walls  In the original Age of Empires games, walls were among the most notable features in the game, and one of the reasons being was how frustrating they could be to assemble. And then Age of Empires 3 went on to increase the awkwardness of the wall feature. In Age of Empires 3, roads are already present in the form of a trade route. While the trade route itself is not bad, the fact that you can‚Äôt even put a gate over the road in order to make your base more adequate in resisting constant raids makes the walls hardly worth the effort in building. Units also can‚Äôt mount walls and get bonus defence points; two things which I believe would enrich the experience of the game‚Äôs combat, in addition to bases not being raided due to a trade route denying a base‚Äôs vitally needed security. Roads  Age of Empires 2 had roads and bridges: two things which Age of Empires 3 lacked, unless we count the trade route. I believe these two features should be reinstated into the game and become a more prominent feature. In other strategy games, roads means having your units marching faster than when walking through swamps, forests or mountains. Allowing players to create roads in order to get from one side of the map to the other in quicker time the way other similar strategy games allow can only be served as a positive complement for the game itself. River maps would be useful in having bridges as well, just like the old games did, with better built bridges allowing more units to simultaneously cross, and at a faster speed. Game Saver  The ability to be able to save a game may be an option that previous instalments offered, but it was not done automatically. It would be far better if all rated games were instantly recorded, since that would make it easier for a player to prove the game happened a certain way. The likelihood of blatant cheaters getting caught would exponentially increase if they knew that any player had the ability to access a game and watch a replay. In turn, the number of false accusations would likely decrease, since the replay would be all the proof needed to know whether or not somebody was cheating. All recorded games should then be put on a search engine so that anybody can view a rated game, not only for entertainment purposes, but also as a way to see how other players play, as well as to possibly spot out a cheater that the opposing player did not catch. Elo Ranking  In the Spring of 2006, Age of Empires 3 introduced the elo rating system, and its functionality was similar to the chess system, where a player of a certain rank could lose or gain a certain amount of points, based on how high their rank was compared to their opponent. The problem with this system, however, is that no matter how inexperienced you were, and how experienced your opponent was in terms of ranking, the loser lost ranking skills, regardless of their actual playing ability. One solution that I have to get around this problem, is for the actual ranking to be based on the actual skill performance shown in an individual game. If a player plays as someone much higher than their rank indicates, then the ranking system ought to demonstrate that by calculating the skill level based on their current rank and vice versa. I am not 100% certain what the best way to calculate this would be, but perhaps the number of kills/loss ratio, amount of resources gathered, experience points, timing when compared to players from other ranks with a similar score could be one way to solve this. Changing the elo ranking system, so that it does not become a matter of simply winning/losing would do the following: lower the number of users noob bashing for ranks; team stacking; rage quitting on a partner; as well as making it easier to find a game if losing does not automatically result in loss of rank. DON‚ÄôT WANT  Below is an idea of what I would want in a strategy game like Age of Empires 4. Microing  While there is no doubt some valuable strategy involved in microing ‚Äî the problem arises when the game gives too much advantage to players that are good at simply massing a big army and overwhelming their opponent with sheer force and neglecting the more strategic and economic aspects of the game. A good balance needs to be interwoven into the game, so that players choosing to focus more on map control, economics and defence structures may do so and not feel as though they are being placed at a significant disadvantage against players more interested in launching all-out-attacks as their specialty. Population Limit  The fact that the old Age of Empires games were limited to 200 population (50 in the original) was made all the worse by the fact that Age of Empires 3 went and reduced that number to a number not seen since the vanilla version of Age of Empires 1 by making it so that a single horse (except ruyters) counted for 2 or 3 population each while other units, such as falconets, took up 5 population. To make matters worse, you could only build up to seven towers in Age of Empires 3, whereas Age of Empires 2 allowed you to build up to a hundred of them, provided you had the resources and time to create them. Considering how easily walls, towers and forts could be destroyed in Age of Empires 3, especially by howitzers, you would think that at the very least the number of fortifications we could build would be substantially increased as compensation for both the vulnerability of the buildings themselves, but also for the very limited amount of units simultaneously available to counter any walls being destroyed by long range units. Rather, a more balanced way to increase population limit without turning the game into who can muster the largest army, is by allowing players to upgrade their cities within the game in the same way that the limit of Ottoman villagers in Supremacy games could be increased through mosque upgrades. The upgrades could include buildings that improve standards of living so that the population points will expand and increase at a faster rate. Population points are then used up to create military units and villagers in the same way that wood, food and gold would be. Once you run out of population points, you need to wait for the population points to return in the same way that you would need to wait for other natural resources to repopulate itself, and then decide from there what type of units to spend the population points on. The rate for which that would happen, is dependent on how many buildings (houses, recreational buildings etc.) you have created. Houses, buildings, technology and food can all be upgraded to make the population points come in at a faster rate Game Stacking  This can apply to other unfair game tactics, including noob bashing or any other deceitful acts intending to allow a player to earn ‚Äúskill‚Äù levels which they did not deserve. The current elo system also causes inexperienced players to lose ranking, even if their skill levels are still better than what their current ranking indicates. For the ranking skill system to have any genuine credibility, the game ought to create a way for skill levels to be based on performance as opposed to whether or not the player wins or loses. Winning or losing may be suitable in determining the overall percentage of games that a particular player has won or loss, but not as a way to determine what their playing level is at. Doing away with team stacking and noob bashing would undoubtedly make it easier for players of all experience levels to find a game, since players would be awarded (and penalised) based on how well they play, and having an inexperienced ally would not effect the other player's algorithm. Blockade  While having blockades in itself is not a bad thing, since it is part of real life warfare, the way it is implemented in this game is indeed far more problematic. For example, players that find themselves being blockaded end up losing the ability to ship for the rest of the game. Though this may still be seen as part of real life, it becomes less realistic when you consider the fact that there is no way for a player to lift a blockade, as would be the case in real life. Rather, the way the blockade feature should be fostered, is for it to be possible for the player being blockaded to be able to lift a blockade. If that means winning enough fights and scoring enough damage on their opponent that it prompts their opponent to lift a blockade, then so be it, as that is one of the most common ways blockades have been lifted in real wars. As a way to entice the blockading player to lift a siege, the game will simply return the amount of money that was paid in blockading the other player, back to the besieging player. This would result in the formerly blockaded player being able to start receiving shipments and better upgrades, while the besieger (blockader) now has more resources back at their disposal. BONUS:  In the day and age when computer games are becoming more advanced, graphically, as well as in terms of game complexity, it would be nice if the game series could also change itself somewhat, since some aspects of the game are undoubtedly out of date and could be improved upon. One suggestion would be for the game play to be something closer to Total War in terms of screen view with a 360 rotation view of the map, as opposed to the old, classic play of seeing everything from above. Armies could get bigger, with potentially thousands of units on screen at a time. New features could be added which could create more depth in terms of strategic game play, as well as making the game itself seem closer to real life (some of the newest Total War games have already come close to achieving that). CONCLUSION:  I could ramble on with more details and features that I would want and not want, but I am not going to try and overload the readers with more information than is necessary, as I feel as though my biggest concerns were already addressed above. One last thing that I will say, however, is for any potential developers making the game to not rely on the franchise name and expect people to flock over and blindly praise the game (Age of Empires Online, anyone?) as history has shown that players will call out a bad game, no matter how popular its prequels may have been. Respect the fan base (which also includes not banning people for no reason and treating them as just ‚Äúone customer‚Äù) and also don‚Äôt try and make the game more complicated than it needs to be in terms of overloading the game with more features and rules than are reasonable to satisfy a customer‚Äôs game depth like other game franchises have done. For the most part, players of the game are happy with the basic game play (gathering resources, building armies, attacking/defending bases, gaining map control etc.); it is the other areas that can be built upon, such as improving the graphics, screenview, better system for measuring a player‚Äôs true skill level, as well as making it easier to find a balanced game that should be the greatest concern.

Swiss Chocolate,Why is the Swiss chocolate considered the best?,"Oh but because it is ! Seriously though, it is obviously a matter of preference, so one couldn‚Äôt say objectively that Swiss chocolate IS the best. But we have a long history with chocolate. As a matter of fact, milk chocolate was invented by a Swiss in 1875 in Vevey (not far from where I live) :  Daniel Peter . And we do have a lot of experience when it comes to the delicious brown substance. Some of our most famous chocolate makers have been honing their skills for more than a century and half (Frey, since 1887 ; Lindt, since 1845), up to 200 years (Favarger, 1828 ; Cailler, 1818). So yeah, Swiss chocolate is delicious and if you dare say that anyone does chocolate better than us, come fight me.  The famous and delicious chocolate Easter bunnies of Lindt, my personal favorite chocolate maker.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Swiss-chocolate-considered-the-best,"There‚Äôs no denying that the swiss have been making chocolate for a long time. They have tried and true approaches and consistent flavor. However, modern chocolate is much less about making every batch, every day taste exactly the same, and much more about highlighting the unique characteristics of each different plantation (even each different harvest year to year) in the way the chocolate is made. It‚Äôs a very different approach, where you can taste fruitiness from these beans, and floral notes from those beans, etc. In some respects, many of the ‚Äúold school‚Äù chocolate makers of Switzerland and Germany have failed to keep up with the times. I‚Äôd love to see the expertise and experience of some of the older makers try fine tuning the roasting and conching of some single origin bars to see what they can come up with. Sadly, they seem to be leaning toward the industrial approach of blending beans to achieve a uniform, consistent flavor batch after batch, creating pleasant but pretty one-note chocolate.",,,,

Chip Shortage,A global chip shortage is continuing to wreak havoc up and down supply chains in the auto industry. How is Tesla overcoming the global chip shortages?,"A statement was made by Elon Musk in July; ""The chip supply is fundamentally the governing factor on our output. It is difficult for us to see how long this will last because ... this is out of our control essentially. It does seem like it's getting better, but it's hard to predict."" As for other parts, he cautioned, "" For the rest of this year, our growth rates will be determined by the slowest part in our supply chain ."" You‚Äôll also notice that Tesla is pushing out delivery dates on their cars. Estimated delivery times on Tesla's website have been pushed back until late this year -- and in some cases next year -- for all but the upper-end versions of the Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. For the two most expensive cars, the Model S and Model X, buyers will have to wait until March or April 2022 for anything but the upper-end ""Plaid"" version of the Model S. For those most pricey Tesla models, the estimated delivery time is January or February. You‚Äôll notice here they‚Äôre being very smart they are prioritizing delivery on the products they make the most money, higher-margin products come 1st. It‚Äôs worthwhile remembering it's not just chips in shortage, it is key car parts as well that are outsourced to other companies, which in turn is compounding the overall shortages that create a domino effect, that will reverberate back through the supply chain. Even as things start coming back online, the production ramp-up will take time along with the ‚Äúbacklog‚Äù of outstanding unfulfilled orders. So to answer your question how Tesla is overcoming the chip shortage is by pushing back delivery target dates as well as extending the normal lead times of their various products. There is also something known as the ‚Äúbull-whip‚Äù effect associated with supply chains. What is the bullwhip effect? The bullwhip effect (also known as the Forrester effect) is defined as the demand distortion that travels upstream in the supply chain from the retailer through to the wholesaler and manufacturer due to the variance of orders which may be larger than that of sales. What causes the bullwhip effect in the supply chain? Demand forecast updating:  Members of the supply chain updating their demand forecasting -  can‚Äôt supply, taking longer to supply, or can‚Äôt supply in the quantity ordered Order batching:  Members of the supply chain rounding up or down the number of orders -  can‚Äôt supply, taking longer to supply, or can‚Äôt supply in the quantity ordered Price fluctuations:  Usually driven by discounting resulting in larger quantities of purchases-  can‚Äôt supply, taking longer to supply, or can‚Äôt supply in the quantity ordered Rationing and gaming:  Buyers and sellers delivering over or under their order quantities -  can‚Äôt supply, taking longer to supply, or can‚Äôt supply in the quantity ordered",https://www.quora.com/A-global-chip-shortage-is-continuing-to-wreak-havoc-up-and-down-supply-chains-in-the-auto-industry-How-is-Tesla-overcoming-the-global-chip-shortages,,,,,

Chip Shortage,Are you expecting the current global computer chip shortage to continue well into 2022?,"No. Two years is a huge period. Meanwhile huge production facilities are established and build. The main problem are the machines which assemble semiconductors. One of the companies is based in Netherlands and its market share is almost 60%. They try to increase production of these machines in order ho help the world inductry increase semiconductors production. Such companies are also based in Japan. They also work hard. The other point was announced from the EU and US authorities. Both sides prepare huge financial packages to help establishing production in US and EU in order to provide local independence from Taiwan and China producers of semiconductors. Huge industries suffer from those shortages. With such political and financial support after one year the crisis will begin to calm down. Remember what happened with the lack of vaccines for the COVID problem. We now have lots of vaccines available, used, and lots of in process of preparation - almost ready to enter the market. Only one year passed since the R and D process started. I consider after 2 years there will be no problem with the semiconductors.",https://www.quora.com/Are-you-expecting-the-current-global-computer-chip-shortage-to-continue-well-into-2022,,,,,

Swiss Chocolate,Is Swiss chocolate the best in the world?,"Sadly, no. Not today. Swiss chocolate was known for years for it's smoothness. But times have changed and chocolates have become better and better thanks to the bean to bar / artisan chocolate movement across the world. These small artisan chocolate makers create chocolate from exceptionally high quality beans from around the world. Their only concern here is exceptional flavour. This is what differentiates them from the Swiss chocolate makers, most of whom over roast their beans because of their low quality and mask them with sugar and other ingredients. The chocolates created by the artisan chocolate makers are made by roasting them at low or optimum temperatures to get the best flavours. They also are particular about the bean being of exceptional quality and pay a high price for the good quality beans which are fermented and dried well. The dark chocolate showcases the true flavour of the region it comes from. For example, a bean from Peru would be fruity and floral with no bitterness, while a bean from Africa could have a pronounced bitterness. Each and every bean is different and thats what great chocolate is all about today. Good beans and good chocolate.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Swiss-chocolate-the-best-in-the-world,,,,,
Swiss Chocolate,Why is Swiss chocolate famous when cacao is not really grown there?,"Chocolate became popular in Europe in the 16th century when Spanish monks brought cocoa from South America to the Spanish court. Following conquest of the Aztec empire, cocoa was regularly exported to Europe, served as a drink made from the ground beans and combined with sugar or milk ‚Äî not unlike coffee ‚Äî sometimes with vanilla. Not much changed until the 19th century when a Dutchman named van Houten found that they could reduce the bitterness of cocoa by adding small alkaline salts. Not long after, he also developed a process to separate the cocoa butter from cocoa. It wasn‚Äôt until and Englishman named Fry figured that he could add cocoa butter back to cocoa and make a moldable chocolate bar that solid chocolate came to be. However, the chocolate was very coarse and didn‚Äôt melt smoothly ‚Äî it also wasn‚Äôt particularly palatable and never became popular. In 1876, Swiss candle maker Daniel Peter developed the method to add powdered milk (provided by Henri Nestl√©) to chocolate and produced the first milk chocolate ‚Äî which cut the bitterness without affecting the shelf life of chocolate, and it became quite popular. Shortly thereafter, in 1879, a Swiss chocolatier named Rodolphe Lindt developed a machine called a ‚Äúconche‚Äù that constantly ground and blended cocoa with cocoa butter, forming an emulsion of fine cocoa particles and cocoa butter to produce a smooth-textured moldable chocolate that not only made a palatable product, but also allowed one to control various properties such as viscosity and melting point. Peter, Nestl√©, and Lindt kicked off of booming business in chocolate confectionary in Switzerland that made the country famous for high-quality chocolate as a confection (as opposed to a drink) that persists to this day.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Swiss-chocolate-famous-when-cacao-is-not-really-grown-there,,,,,

Swiss Chocolate,What is the difference between Swiss and Belgian Chocolates?,"The primary difference between Belgian-style chocolate and Swiss-style chocolate is that Belgian chocolate very often has cream in it to create the ganache. Swiss chocolate is very often made with locally produced milk as Swiss chocolate was founded as a milk chocolate. Today, there is an increasing amount of dark chocolate being produced in both Belgium and Switzerland, creating less of a difference between the two in the broad sense.

Jeff Bezos,Will Jeff Bezos be the first trillionaire (in terms of net worth)?,"I‚Äôm going to assume a few things before I give you my guess: Inflation doesn‚Äôt massively increase in the next few decades. Criminal activity will not have an affect on the outcome. Jeff Bezos does not die in the next 40 years. I think these 3 things are pretty reasonable. All estimates will be made with the USD (otherwise Zimbabwe dollar owners become the richest). First off: I‚Äôm going to look at if Jeff Bezos has major competition in the present: Bezos vs Buffet vs Musk vs Other (someone who has not risen to I think those are the only people we know of with a real chance of hitting 1 billion based on their past choices. However, Buffett won‚Äôt live forever so I think we can take him out. Bezos vs Musk. Bezos is currently about 3‚Äì5X richer than Musk. But Musk is taking on more challenges than Bezos is. While Bezos only runs one business, Musk has leadership roles in Tesla (which I predict will become the #1 car supplier by 2035 because companies like Uber and Lyft will pick them once automation is popular), SpaceX (which is working on Starlink which will bring high speed internet to everyone on earth), and Neuralink (working to make prosthetics a reality for everyone). Those are the three companies that I think will be his biggest sources of income. Lastly, there is the third party. Some young genius out there with an idea that will completely revolutionize everything. For the sake of this, my guess is that some person other than Bezos will have 1 trillion dollars by 2035‚Äì2040. This means that Bezos must a) get 1 trillion dollars before 2035 b) get 1 trillion dollars before Musk For Bezos, he has a serious challenge. Amazon must grow to an ~8‚Äì10 trillion dollar company before he can make 1 trillion dollars. That‚Äôs not going to happen anytime soon. Look, I don‚Äôt care what he does, but no company will be valued at 10 trillion dollars in the next 15 years unless massive inflation happens (which breaks one of the the rules). I am going to guess that there is a 45% chance the Amazon reaches 10 trillion dollars in 25 years. That is very rapid growth, which would break all previously conceived records. The reason I think that someone else will hit this first is because I think that there is someone out there working on some company that will change the world soon, and it will dwarf Bezos‚Äô empire. Just remember; 20 years ago, Bezos was still building his company. He hadn‚Äôt become a billionaire yet. The same could be true of the third party character. In addition, it would only take one mistake for Amazon to become a monopoly, and that would make Bezos massively less wealthy. Based on that, I think that Bezos has a 5% chance of beating this other person. If Musk‚Äôs businesses succeed rapidly, he will beat Bezos to 1 trillion. Tesla is on track to become absolutely massive. They keep breaking their old records and are growing each year, while EVs grow in popularity and technology advances. When he brings internet to the entire world, he‚Äôll increase his wealth vastly, and SpaceX could be contracted to help NASA with Artemis (likely a massive deal). Neuralink could provide movement to people who have been paralyzed for years, and he could become massively successful. Given this, I think Musk has a 10% chance of becoming the worlds first trillionaire. Overall, I‚Äôd give Bezos a 4% chance. Musk is doing more, and there are other people out there with bigger dreams and brighter futures.",https://www.quora.com/Will-Jeff-Bezos-be-the-first-trillionaire-in-terms-of-net-worth,"Thing is, Bezos doesn‚Äôt just own Amazon (the valuation of which has already reached 2.5 trillion this month).

Chip Shortage,"What is the chip shortage, and why is it causing the price of new cars to increase?","The answer is simple. The chip shortage has lowered inventories. Low inventory coupled with demand equals higher prices. Computer chips are used in many parts of modern vehicles. As part of a modern day supply chain, computer chips are obtained essentially as required. They are not typically stored in large quantities by the car makers. As a response to COVID caused car sales decreases many car manufacturers chose to suspend or minimize computer chip orders. Manufacturers of other products stepped in to fill the gap and ordered more chips. Now the car manufacturer‚Äôs find they are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of computer chips to build as many vehicles as they need. Hence inventories of some vehicles are low. Car pricing is largely dependent on supply and demand. If supply is low and demand is not low, price will go up. That is the case now. High prices are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Good prices might still be obtainable but that may take some effort and might be applicable to certain models.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-chip-shortage-and-why-is-it-causing-the-price-of-new-cars-to-increase,,,,,
Chip Shortage,What can the White House do to alleviate the chip shortage?,"Please, bear one thing on your mind: politicians create problems, do not solve them, at least not for people! Reasons why is chip shortage are many, by my opinion main one is western greed! In last 30 years literally every production on west (USA, EU, etc) is literally destroyed and moved to Far East to earn as much money as possible. First was China but today China is too expensive and more cheaper countries, like Vietnam, are now in. When they become too expensive they will ‚Äúinvade‚Äù Africa. Look what we have today in IC manufacturing: Only two high end fabs in Korea (Samsung) and Taiwan (TSMC). Only western company is Intel and it is some 5 years behind. No one else in whole world! To be even more sad, ASML as main equipment manufacturer is EU company as well as other companies producing wafers, testing, etc. Samsung and TSMC are on geographically and geopolitically unstable region. We see today draught is another problem for TSMC. Just a bit stronger earthquake is enough to move whole world into stone age! DDR, FLASH manufacturing is also in same region, eg Micron, SK Hynix Thanks to China west has other parts, eg passives. But recently were problems with caps cause of China. Imagine if China bans export to West as US did to them!? Governments will solve problems? Ha ha ha.
I‚Äôm in Ireland and Intel after 10 years finally got green light to start building new fab in Ireland. 10 years! Do you know why? Cause one farmer was suing them (some say cause Intel did not buy his land) cause of ‚Äúeco reasons‚Äù. I remember how Trump arranged deal with Foxconn and others. Where are fabs? Nowhere! Canceled! We might discuss why Intel is behind, why there are no west fabs etc. Should we ask what Intel management did and does?

Btw, why AMD sold GF?",https://www.quora.com/What-can-the-White-House-do-to-alleviate-the-chip-shortage,"Sounds to me that chip production is a vital National infrastructure issue, and if we should make high speed internet infrastructure possible, that having factories, infrastructure, available to make chips in the US is essential, even if it will cost more money.

Tech Scalpers,What is it like to work as an engineer at TicketMaster given the universal hate of their shady business practices such as convenience fees?,"I love working as a software engineer at Ticketmaster.  I started here in 2002, after having worked at a couple of start-ups before that. What I like about it: The hours are pretty constantly 40 hour weeks, OT is fairly rare. There are some opportunities to travel if you want, but you don't normally have to. We ticketed the London, Beijing, and Athens games, and have teams on site for those events The people are fun to work with.  I work with people who have been with the company for over 30 years, and it does have a family vibe to it. Disclaimer, I'm in the Phoenix office where the company was founded, other offices may have different cultures to them. The pay is fair, not great, but not horrible.  You find that the people who have been here for many years aren't the type of people for whom $ is the primary motivating factor. There's never and end to the technical challenges to be solved.  New products, new business needs, new markets, etc.  In a given year I'll program in as many as 7-10 different languages working on systems ranging from brand new, to 30+ years old. Ticketmaster has been a tech company since before tech companies were a thing.  SaaS ... that's been our business for 40 years. My retort to your claim of ""shady business practices"": Ticketmaster is very upfront with the customer, you pay us for the convenience of being able to buy your tickets online, via your mobile device, over the phone, at a retail outlet, etc., instead of being required to go down the the box office to buy them.  If you don't want to pay for that convenience, then don't.  At the end of the day tickets to live events are 100% luxury items.  If the price is too high, please don't buy the ticket, save your money, you don't NEED to go see someone lip-sync a song in person. As a customer of Ticketmaster as well, I don't like the ""here are $40 tickets"", to find out at checkout they are actually $65.73.  However, this is NOT Ticketmaster's fault.  Ticketmaster REALLY wants venues/artists/promoters to use ""all in"" pricing, but they largely refuse.  Under the guise of ""transparency"" they don't want ""their"" tickets to be listed at more than face price. As for the convenience fees ... it's an open secret in the industry that Ticketmaster only keeps a fraction of those fees, a big chunk goes back to the venue/artist/promoter, but Ticketmaster agrees to be ""the bad guy"" so the artists can keep their ""for the common man"" persona. Ticketmaster is held to a different standard than other players in the ticketing industry.  Example: Ticketmaster has a resale platform, but we only turn it on if the venue/artist/promoter agree to us turning it on.  However, other resale sites have no such limitations. Bots.  Everyone HATES bots.  Ticketmaster has entire teams of operations folks and engineers whose only job is to try and fight bots, so true fans can buy the tickets.  But there are 2 fundamental problems: Hot tickets are priced too cheaply.  Brokers/scalpers know this and know they can buy that $50 ticket and resell it a fan for $200.  As long as there are margins like that, their will be $ufficient motivation for them to find exploits in the system. The best computers are better than the worst humans at navigating a website.  CAPTCHA can't stop all bots with out stopping most people too.  Then there are those outfits who use call center folks in India to solve the CAPTCHAs for them, how do you beat that? In summary, I like working at Ticketmaster because it is a nice place to work, with nice people to work with, and is technically challenging without being overly stressful.  I disagree with your thesis that Ticketmaster has ""shady business practices"".  Ticketmaster isn't like the big banks that pocket crazy cash, then when their truly shady business practices collapse have to get bailed out by the tax payers.  Ticketmaster sells a service to customers.  If customers don't want to pay it, there is no ObamaTickets law that makes them buy our product, you do so of your own free will and choice.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-as-an-engineer-at-TicketMaster-given-the-universal-hate-of-their-shady-business-practices-such-as-convenience-fees,"And if you don't want to pay for that convenience, you usually don't have to skip the show.  Ticketmaster does not charge a service charge for sales through the box office; you can drive down there and get your tickets during whatever hours they may be open and Ticketmaster gets no part of the sale.  You don't want to do that?  Right, that's the convenience.  Yes, at some box offices there is a charge tacked on at the box office - sometimes even matching or exceeding Ticketmaster's fees - but that's the box office up-charging you, not Ticketmaster.",,,,

Tech Scalpers,What are some of the most mind-blowing facts about San Francisco?,"I‚Äôve lived in SF since 1972, at which time my wife and I had the unbelievable good sense (and luck) to buy a house here. We moved ‚Äúup the hill‚Äù in 1985 and are still there, with two kids ‚Äúborn and raised‚Äù. Needless to say, we‚Äôve seen a lot of changes over the years, many good, but not all for the best. Many of the other comments here convey my own feelings for why we stayed in SF instead of moving down the Peninsula or over to the East Bay. But I would add a few more: 1) the cultural scene is outstanding. We have world-class ballet, symphony, and opera companies. There‚Äôs a huge amount of local theater, in addition to the touring Broadway shows, which always seem to make SF their first or second stop. The SF Museum of Modern Art has just reopened, and has one of the best collections in the world. Unfortunately, the high cost of living here has put a serious strain on artists and performing companies, and I hope that they can continue to exist here. 2) the restaurant scene is dominated by local places, rather than by chains. Sadly, we have an Olive Garden (out in the far southwestern corner of the city), but fortunately no PF Chang or Chick-fil-a. If you look hard, there‚Äôs an Applebee‚Äôs at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, a Denny‚Äôs downtown, and numerous Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs, Subways, KFC, and Taco Bell here and there. But they are the exception, and there are about 4000 local places. Someone once figured out that everyone who lives here could go out to dinner at the same time and there would still be available space. Not all of the 4000 are great, by any stretch, but any place that survives for a couple of years outside the tourist areas is likely to be OK (or better). We finally have a few places that can make a good NY-style pizza, but SF is a tough place to go searching for a NY-style bagel, as the local scene is dominated by Noah‚Äôs round puffy rolls. But prices are extremely high - you regularly pay $3 for hot water and a tea bag - and other prices match that level. There‚Äôs a 3‚Äì4% surcharge everywhere to cover a city-sponsored health care plan for restaurant workers. 3) the professional sports scene is OK, though you have to leave SF (for now) to see the Warriors, who will return to SF in 2018 after 50+ years in East Oakland. Pro football has moved to distant Santa Clara in Silicon Valley, major league hockey and soccer are more than an hour away in San Jose. American League baseball is in Oakland, but the Giants are here in beautiful AT&T Park, flying their three World Series pennants. Dynamic pricing makes Giants tickets expensive, though not as bad as tix for Yankee Stadium or Fenway. Games always sell out, so you usually have to buy through scalpers online or near the Park. 4) the City spends a lot on the public library system. If you are patient, you can check out both hard cover and eBooks, as well as DVDs, through the library. You can go into any branch and find a wide selection of magazines and newspapers in many languages. 5) the City also spends a lot on the public parks. Everyone knows Golden Gate Park, but there are more than 200 parks and open spaces in our 49 sq.mi. city. These are widely and heavily used by everyone, with the occasional conflicts over dogs running free and homeless encampments. We also have the Golden Gate National Recreation Area on the northern waterfront. What was formerly a military area (the Presidio) now has lots to see and do. 6) people‚Äôs tolerance is fraying a bit from what it once was. The City has long had a live-and-let-live attitude, which is why we became a destination for ‚Äúhippies‚Äù in the 60s and a safe home for the LGBT community. The weather and available services have made SF attractive to the homeless, who are a highly visible presence in and near downtown and the major tourist areas. One local government after another has tried to address the problem, so far without success. Many of our local tech companies are trying to help, too, but there are also a lot of newer arrivals with a sense of entitlement and less of a sense of community. There‚Äôs much more, but this list was intended to complement other answers to this question. Finally, to reinforce the point: if you come here, bring money. There are good values to be found, but it takes a while to find them. Last, just because it‚Äôs June or July doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs warm here. May and September are the warmest months, but you will need a jacket or coat in the evening.

Tech Scalpers,"Is now a good time to upgrade my GPU? It is a 1660 Ti. If so, what should I upgrade to?","It depends on your situation. Do you often find yourself bothered because your PC isn't getting the performance you want in the games that you play? Or does your PC still get a relatively decent performance in games (e.g.: 60+ fps)? If this is the case, then I guess your PC is doing kinda okay. Lower than that, then I understand why you'd ask this question. On the other hand, maybe you're getting 60 fps and that still isn't good enough for you. Maybe you want to enjoy the full experience of a 144Hz monitor, requiring a minimum of 144 fps in your games. It's also worth considering to check other parts of your build before you buy a new GPU. Will your CPU bottleneck your new GPU? Is your CPU bottlenecking your current GPU? Or maybe it could be a RAM problem, or a thermal problem. High temperatures of both CPU and GPU does hinder performance. Your full PC specs would help here. Personally, I don't think 1660 Ti is  that  outdated. It's still a decent card I guess. But, there's nothing wrong with wanting a better performance for a better gaming experience. If you do want to upgrade your GPU, I recommend checking out Nvidia's 3000 series. It's the latest series, it outperforms its predecessors, and it also sells at a lower price point. The RTX 3060 Ti sells at approximately $500-$550 range, and it would be a  huge  upgrade from your current GPU. The RTX 3070 sells at about $100 higher for a 10% increase in performance. Either is a very good choice. You should check if you can get one for a ""normal"" price instead of a scalper's price.

Tech Scalpers,"I‚Äôve been given the opportunity to ‚Äújump the line‚Äù to get a vaccine. It feels wrong since I am young and healthy. I did not ask for this opportunity, someone shared the registration with me. Do I do it?","Im going to talk about the PlayStation 5. Because it totally relates. No, I‚Äôm serious. No, really, I promise. Bear with me. In case you aren‚Äôt up on the PS5 situation (or the situation with any of the video gaming related computer hardware launches since September), the quick summary is: A huge list of new products using the latest chips made with the latest chip making technology have all launched together. Processors, Graphics cards, Video game consoles, Macs with custom processors in them, and the usual yearly smartphone upgrades on top. Manufacturing for such new chips usually starts at about half speed, and takes a year to really get going, so shortages of new products are not unusual. We have seen this before, especially with video game consoles. All these new devices have launched at once, and behind the scenes, only two companies are responsible for manufacturing ALL of these chips. So there is a bit of a buying panic. Nobody can get them. The companies can‚Äôt make them fast enough. Any that pop up for sale at retailers are gone in literally seconds. So now we get to the scalpers. This has been getting to be more and more of a problem. People follow trends for hot new tech gadgets. They then hack into computers, to take control of a large number of computers on the internet, which they call ‚Äúbots‚Äù. They load them with a program that will buy the latest tech for them from any online retailer where it pops up. Because these people control a large number of computers that are controlled by programs, not humans, they flood the retailer websites so no humans can get through. They buy up all the stock. They then turn around and list them, unopened, on resale websites like eBay. Usually, for double or triple the price. This is awful. It‚Äôs horribly unethical. They are watching for desperate consumers. They then  purposefully  make those consumers‚Äô situation even more desperate. Then, once everyone is nice and desperate, they price gouge them. It isn‚Äôt just video game stuff either. Remember the COVID shortages in 2020? The scalpers were in on that too. People bought massive amounts of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, etc. The shortages wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad if people weren‚Äôt hoarding, and these people were purposefully hoarding in huge amounts, in the hope they would make you desperate enough that you would come to them for the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù to pay triple. I wanted a PlayStation 5. Like millions of people. And trying to get one (and hopelessly failing, repeatedly) was disappointing and aggravating. I make decent money and if I was so inclined I could have just gone on eBay and paid triple for one, rather than waiting my turn and putting up with the aggravation. But I didn‚Äôt do that. Do you know why? Because I would have been rewarding bad behavior. I would have been encouraging scalpers to just be even more aggressive next time. I would be screwing over my fellow man by cutting in line. But even worse, I would be screwing over everyone, including myself, in the future, because now I have just encouraged the problem to be even worse next time. Do you know what I did instead? I waited. I kept on trying, like everyone else, following the rules, waiting for my turn to come up. And last week, I got one. Legitimately. The right way. From a retailer, at list price. No shenanigans. Was I the first on the block with one? No. Could I have been playing those awesome new games over the holidays if I had taken an illegitimate shortcut and paid extra money for it? Yep. But I didn‚Äôt. Because the harm I cause with my selfishness and impatience isn‚Äôt worth it. Vaccines are way more important than PlayStation‚Äôs. If doing the right thing, playing by the rules, and waiting your turn is important for PlayStations, it sure as hell is way more important for vaccines. My mother is on medication that suppresses immune system. She is able to take the vaccine, and it will help protect her at least some, they think. But she has to take the vaccine in the period right in between treatments, when her immune system is strongest. Because she is still fairly young, she only qualifies for the vaccine early by immune system risk, not by age or other high risk factors. They keep changing the group priorities, and she doesn‚Äôt know when her turn is going to come up. She will have a one week window in February. If her turn isn‚Äôt up in that week of February, she could have to wait until June. With a compromised immune system. She has already had to hide in her house in fear for a year. If people are cutting in line, they could easily delay her dose by a week. But for her, that‚Äôs not a one week delay. It‚Äôs four months. How would you feel if other people being greedy and selfish, put your mothers‚Äô life at risk? I hope you‚Äôd be angry about that. Because I will be. If you cut in line, it might be ok. It might not end up affecting anyone that much. But it‚Äôs far easier than you think to create deadly consequences for someone else who should have had that shot. It might not matter. But it might matter  a lot.  Wait your turn.",https://www.quora.com/I-ve-been-given-the-opportunity-to-jump-the-line-to-get-a-vaccine-It-feels-wrong-since-I-am-young-and-healthy-I-did-not-ask-for-this-opportunity-someone-shared-the-registration-with-me-Do-I-do-it,"For your mother‚Äôs situation, I suggest that she let her pharmacist and/or doctor know the situation.

Having shopped in Switzerland since 1996, I can say that, while the big high-end Swiss brands are consistently excellent, the best chocolates in any country are made by boutique producers who direct-source, mix and sell relatively small quantities of very fresh ingredients. So if I‚Äôm baking a cake, torte, or souffle, the Swiss brands are my first choice. But if I‚Äôm buying chocolates for a friend in Canada, I‚Äôll go to a local shop that makes the chocolate on the premises.

Tech Scalpers,What is your reaction to the announcement that Warped Tour 2018 will be its last? What will summer be like without Warped Tour? How will its absence affect the music genres it showcased and supported? What will happen to their up-and-coming bands?,"The Australian festival industry is facing serious challenges. While the Vans Warped tour has good figures in the US, there‚Äôs a very chequered history of support for the Australian leg of the event. Kevin Lyman‚Äôs US-based tour event presents with just shy of one hundred acts. Just as in Australia, the lineup focuses on metal-punk bands. There was a four year hiatus for Vans Warped in Oz from 2013, coming after a twelve year break since 2001.    Many of the featured bands are sourced from  UNIFIED Music Group , while industry giants are locked in a battle for control of the sector with the international festival juggernaut,  Live Nation .     Video Credit: One of the Unified label‚Äôs headline acts,  Northlane  released a new album, ‚ÄúMesmer‚Äù‚Äîtimed for maximum impact during the Warped US tour. Kevin has previously announced his intention to expand into fourteen countries, but at this point, the logistics of a cross-country Australian leg, with huge distances between cities, high labour and production costs, declining attendance for festivals and onerous compliance demands by local authorities? Nope, the outlook is not good. THE AWFUL TRUTH The Australian festival scene is suffering from increased ticket prices and declining attendances. The cashed-up Live Nation group has been using its deep pockets to aggressively snap up Australian festivals. Big Day Out, Legion and Soundwave have shut down.  Video Credit:  Northlane // Mesmer ; sophisticated multimedia and live event production values come at heavy capital cost. Multi-national monoliths like Live Nation have had mixed results, with little improvement in crowd numbers. Production companies and contractors have experienced delays in payments and way too many court cases as high level, much-loved and legendary promoters, with twenty-five year histories of success have retired, sold event stakes, gone bankrupt or died. Right now as the Aussie summer comes on‚Äîstagehands, roadies and production companies who only a few years ago had to subcontract out to labour hire companies to access enough ‚Äúbox-pushers‚Äù are now scrambling for work as the festival sector contracts. It‚Äôs a period of buyouts and consolidation as predatory Pacific and American production companies muscle in and snap up the cream. While Australia lacks depth in the manufacture of event gear, the country has huge talent resources, exporting expertise worldwide, especially in event industry conferences promoted by ‚ÄòDestination NSW‚Äô during the annual Vivid Festival.        Oz hosts the largest lighting hire company in the southern hemisphere, world-class audio, electronics and innovative event engineering companies. Boutique festivals are flourishing. Even so, professionals and freelancers who reasonably expected ninety-hour weeks at this time of year and could name their rates are now relying on industry contacts and alliances to survive. At the lower end of the scale, skilled labour hire is drifting to other industries as opportunities evaporate away. It‚Äôs a grim picture where the facts don‚Äôt make it past the confident announcements and responses to public enthusiasm: The Festivals (Contemporary Music) category experienced significant declines in ticket sales revenue by 25.2% from $107m in 2015 to $79.9m in 2016 and by 48.2% in attendance from 1.3m in 2015 to 0.67m in 2016. Contemporary Music Festival revenue peaked in 2014 at $129.2m. Between 2014 and 2016 revenue decreased by 38.2%. This category experienced the second highest decline in revenue (after Circus and Physical Theatre) and attendance (after Special Events). Contrary to the declines in revenue and attendance, average ticket prices for this category increased by 6.7% from $117.72 to $125.60 in 2016. The substantial decrease in Festivals (Contemporary Music) revenue and attendance was primarily driven by the cancellation of major national touring festivals Future Music Festival and Stereosonic in 2016. Major contemporary music festivals that took place in 2016 include Splendour in the Grass, Bluesfest, Groovin‚Äô the Moo, St. Jerome‚Äôs Laneway Festival, VIVID Live and Meredith Music Festival. The music festival market in SA and WA were hit particularly hard by the cancellation of two major festivals, experiencing a decrease in revenue by 74.6% and 52% respectively. ‚Äî Ticket Attendance and Revenue Survey 2016 . Industry-wide, attendance numbers have halved since 2015, revenue's back to pre-2010 levels:  Image Credit:  Live Performance Australia, Ticket Attendance and Revenue Survey 2016 . The effect of Warped‚Äôs absence on the strong Australian metal-punk scene will be minimal. After all, there‚Äôs only been three tours in seventeen years. The effect of the tour on the Aussie music scene is sadly, far less than fans realise. Punters will continue to support their genres without much knowledge of the realities of promoting large scale events, while social media erupts with strong opinions. Harsh reality? Due to heavy consolidation and increasing costs plus smaller margins in cross-country event productions, there‚Äôll continue to be a painful period of adjustment. Young bands will still experiment and develop loyal followings while internationals balk at the realities, logistics and costs of Australian tours‚Äîinstead, focusing on Sydney and Melbourne gigs. It‚Äôs called the music  business  for a reason. Never forget, the music industry is so highly organised, artists receive an average $25 per $1,000 spent by the public on their music. Worldwide, ninety per cent of music produced never sells. The most vocal opinions in the metal-punk fanbase often tend to come from those who pirate their sources of music.  If you love an artist, support them.    As for Vans Warped? As Joni Mitchell sang, ‚ô´ ‚ÄúY ou don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôve got ‚Äòtill it‚Äôs gone. ‚Äù ‚ô¨  POST-EDIT: I‚Äôve had some comment on other platforms about this piece being an ‚ÄúAustralian answer to an American question.‚Äù There‚Äôs reasons for that: Australia is a very good thermometer for the world industry, with its high average incomes and distillation of The Arts and media sourced from all over the globe. I expect to see large scale events continue in Europe, Japan, some South American countries and Korea, where the logistics are much easier and the depth of support more fanatic. In The States? Ongoing structural economic and social inequities may spell the decline of all but the elite festivals in privileged regional markets like California and New York. Here in Oz, Peter Noble‚Äôs  Byron Bay Bluesfest  goes from strength to strength, with sophisticated marketing beginning the day the previous year‚Äôs festival opens. Yet even with Bluesfest, it‚Äôs the east coast sideshows which make the venture economic for artists and accessible to fans. The other mega-fests are generally struggling. Headline events like Sydney‚Äôs Vivid and New Years Eve are getting larger crowds every year‚Äîover 1.6m, but they‚Äôre free to attend and the public is largely unaware that the real purpose of the events is the conferences, networking and tech exchange that occurs out-of-sight at corporate events associated with the displays. The regulatory environment, cost of tech and punter attitudes are all killing larger events. In California,  Desert Trip  was an outlier. I like to rave on on Quora about U2‚Äôs 360 ¬∞  in 2010‚Äîwhat an experience building that was! But, that was a ¬æ billion tour that didn‚Äôt break even until 70% of the way through. Looking back, in many ways, that tour seven years ago was the high tide mark in events production. The consolidation phase has created conditions where companies with an eye on ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù are leading. The lighting hire company I mentioned creates creches of lighting designers paid a fraction of freelance rates, who in return, get to practice their craft with an extraordinary volume of work. The company‚Äôs worth ¬º of a billion, run by a ruthlessly focused (lighting pun intended) legend in the industry. As for ticket prices? On a related note, something heartening just happened in Australia. The powerful Australian Competition and Consumer Commission recently took on ticket reseller, Viagogo. ( ACCC takes ticket reseller Viagogo to court ). It‚Äôll be impossible for them to continue in Australia without making drastic adjustments to their current business model. Of course, they merely offered the platform with a ridiculous 30% markup and obscure, impenetrable customer support practices; it was the public‚Äîthe scalpers armed with bots and punters asking outrageous prices for resales of presale tickets, plus the fraudsters selling fake tix who created the problems and the public outrage. There‚Äôs greed and sharks at all levels. There will always be exceptions‚Äîsome mega events will survive‚Äîbut the near future is most definitely in targeted, boutique events and distributed online streaming broadcasts. ‚Äî https://postcardsfromaroadie.quora.com/Music-Festivals%E2%80%94The-Awful-Truth/comment/1434628",https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-reaction-to-the-announcement-that-Warped-Tour-2018-will-be-its-last-What-will-summer-be-like-without-Warped-Tour-How-will-its-absence-affect-the-music-genres-it-showcased-and-supported-What-will-happen-to-their-up-and-coming-bands,"Wow.

Tech Scalpers,Why do many people prefer PC gaming?,"Reason so many people prefer PC over console is The most updated platform, once the new technology exist (like what NVIDIA does), it become next compass. It's always applied to any game, every dev trying to not only making good game with good story, but also pushing the limit of tech itself, thus why usually PC being prefer over console where they usually late around year or 2. Easy to use and customize, maybe you just normal guy who had laptop and call it a day, but sometimes people doesn't want had many devices, not only that, once newer tech is exist, they just need to upgrade it rather bought new one. Not only easy to upgrade from any side, but also easy to customize, let's say you want to had clean setup or practical structure for your folder and such, it's easier on pc. Large library, like not just a norm library, but large library that exist on university or goverment funded library. Check on steam or other third-party library such icthio or gog, you'll be surprised by the amount of game exist. Also some company such Sony already make a move to porting game such Quantic Dream, Naughty Dogs, etc, already had their game on port. Cheap, like cheap (if we don't count scalper inflation), if you think about change from console to console, ye it cheap, but if you count overall such laptop, console, etc. I think it's more cheaper PC than console. Since it became your battlestation not only for game, but also for video editing, coding, etc. Why bother had many devices (except if like to play on console, I'm not argue with that)",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-people-prefer-PC-gaming,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,I bought him an Alienware Aurora with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4GB GDDR5 with Intel i5-9400. His friends are telling him it‚Äôs garbage. He won‚Äôt get more than 60fps. He also has the Alienware 144hz monitor. Will it get 100fps?,"That depends on these two things: The title (some are more demanding and less optimized than others) If he‚Äôs willing to drop his settings a bit Like others have said, the i5 is a good midrange processor and should be able to play most games no problem, unless they‚Äôre particularly CPU-intensive. The graphics card is going to be your bottleneck - the 1650 is just not that powerful in comparison with a more modern card. He should be able to get 60 out of it on most games though, provided he‚Äôs willing to drop the graphics settings. Of course, that depends on which game he‚Äôs playing, since some run better than others. That said, it‚Äôs  usually  cheaper to build rigs yourself. By the time you‚Äôve bought all the parts, you‚Äôve still spent less than it would typically cost to buy a prebuilt. Here are the parts you‚Äôll need: Motherboard Case (preferably a cheap one with good airflow) CPU CPU cooler (Ryzen 3000-series and up processors come with some pretty good air coolers in the box, but there are more expensive ones out there that perform better) Graphics card Power supply Storage drive, of which there are three types: Hard drive: slower, but cheaper and with far more space for the money SATA SSD: faster than a hard drive, but more expensive with less space for the money NVMe SSD: fastest, but the most expensive and with the least amount of space for the money A Windows install RAM Probably at least one additional case fan (check the reviews for your case first though to see if others think the stock fans are enough to keep the system cool) As far as how to put all this together, there are loads and loads of guides out there on how to set it all up.  However comma,  I would wait a bit to build another system if you think you‚Äôll be in the market again soon. Certain parts (mainly graphics cards) are hard to come by thanks to bots and scalpers, and that probably won‚Äôt be changing for a few months.

Tech Scalpers,Why is there a GPU shortage?,"There isn't just one reason as many people would like you to believe: yes crypto is one of the reasons but not the main reason this time around. The main issue is demand, something most people overlook, gaming has boomed because of covid. Making a LOT of new gamers needing new tech. New pcs need new gpu's, the demand is about 3‚Äì5 times higher than any previous launch. Then you add the fact that there's a global silicon shortage in about every sector needed computer chips, resulting in a drop in production capacity as well. Then you end up with too little gpu's to start with. Then yes cryptominers buy these as well but they don't buy more than they used to according to numbers nvidia released in May 2021 (if I recall it correctly). The shortage has NOT just 1 reason it's a combination of reasons. Making this shitshow a reality for many people. The shortage gets help from scalpers as well who recently discovered that pc parts also can make them a LOT of money (look at these 3090's going for 10+k). The little stock that exists is bought by these people.

Jeff Bezos,What are Jeff Bezos‚Äô biggest mistakes as CEO of Amazon?,"One big mistake that Amazon is making right now is that they are not giving anyone access to their data, logins, customer relationships, etc. Amazon is in the position to 10x their market cap by powering every e-commerce transaction in the world. Amazon‚Äôs strategy has been to own 100% of the transaction ‚Ä¶ and that has worked out really well for them thus far. But they have an opportunity to power EVERY e-commerce transaction by providing access to easy login, payments, authentication, and data on every buyer. They could make everyone‚Äôs e-commerce experience much, much better. Not only will that give  Amazon  more access to the pie, it will significantly grow the pie because it would provide a lubricant to make all e-commerce transactions (especially in mobile) better. Amazon is now playing it safe When it comes to e-commerce, Amazon is playing it very, very safe. And who can blame them? They are a truly amazing company that provides a great product, makes transactions easy, and has wonderful customer service. The thing that has helped them is that all the other large commerce players will not get together and form a co-op to compete with Amazon. Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Best Buy, GroupOn, Zynga, etc. have not worked together in any way to share data, experiences, login authentication, etc. Amazon is betting that it will be too hard to coordinate the other commerce players ‚Ä¶ and it might be correct ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ but ‚Ä¶ if there was a co-op of all the top retailers it could be unstoppable. So Amazon is taking a bet that the world does not change (which is likely a good bet). There is no other company that has data as valuable as Amazon (except maybe Google) Google (via Gmail) has access to what consumers are buying across e-commerce providers (from reading e-mail receipts). Of course, this is really valuable. Besides Google, no other company in the U.S. has a sense of what people are buying more than Amazon. Even the average person is buying tons of items from Amazon. Their history is really rich (and for some, spans over 15 years!). Amazon has done everything to hold the data for its own use only. It is super protective of the data. It is the only company I know of that masks and regularly changes its email receipts so companies like Google have a hard time reading them. This closed system has served them well thus far ‚Ä¶ but time will tell if they could be blind-sided by a more open data system.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-Jeff-Bezos‚Äô-biggest-mistakes-as-CEO-of-Amazon,"They have already moved forward into ‚Äúpowering‚Äù e-comm transaction. They have opened up their doors as the largest online retailer in the world to allow other people to tell their goods online. Yes, this has been around for several years, but this has allowed Amazon to grow even larger than it was before. Proposing that other retailers band together together is something that will never happen. They are competitors, simple as that. They don‚Äôt want to share data. It is the same reason that Amazon doesn‚Äôt want to share its data either. Why would any company want to share their data like that? A competitor gets a hold of it, and it can potentially be downhill from there.","consumers are more weary of their data and private information being leaked. looked up what happened with facebook hacking. Amazon is an ecommerce site, and since they accept payments they have to be doubly cautious with scandals. I think they enphasise the privacy and protection of consumers which is why they are so successful","Okay, so how can Amazon actually use that data and power every e-commerce transaction? Could you please elaborate? I did not understand this.","You‚Äôre not considering China, India markets. Those markets have comparable companies that can dominate the world as well. Having success in India or China means success with 1,000,000,000 people will having success in US only means success with 325,000,000 people.","I hope you are joking. Customer data is confidential and every company that wants to remain in business has a duty to protect it. Just imagine the number of lawsuits if Amazon or Walmartwere to start selling customer data, it would make Facebook and Cambridge analytics look like a minor hiccup. I am really not sure what you are implying. Also if a company has insights about the customer it would serve them and customer far better if the access to those insights was more controlled. That way customer trust is protected and companies get to make money by providing a form of curtailed and secure access to the right customer cohort - and example of that is Google ads. So I am not sure what you are implying. PS: all comments are my personal opinion"
Tech Scalpers,"What do you think about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, 3070, and 3080 laptop GPUs?","While the RTX 3000 mobile series will be successful via performance, not many will by these laptops as PRICE comes into place.

Chip Shortage,How is the chip shortage affecting Indian stocks?,"The chip shortage has affected Indian stocks in a bad way. The automobile industries, which was largely stagnant even before covid struck, has been facing another issue in the form of chip shortage now. All segments of vehicles, be it Passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles are facing production issues. Many large cap companies like Maruti are facing this issue. Also, since India is a country where two-wheelers are primarily used, two-wheeler manufacturer like Hero Honda and TVS motors are also facing this issue. This is really worrisome during this time of the year since this is the festive season in India and many people look to this time to either upgrade their vehicles or buy new ones. A majority of the Indian population tend to buy new motorcycles during this season. A shortage in supply would mean that there is no sale or offer and the people will have to either reluctantly shell out more money than they expected or postpone their plans of buying new vehicles. Also, we don‚Äôt know how long this chip shortage would last. According to some reports, there are no alternates being put in place to ramp up the productions of chips for automobile supply. The existing chip manufacturers will have to slowly increase their production and meet the supply targets. However, this could a slow process and could take months to reach the pre-covid levels. This slow supply process is going to hurt the end-year sales target of the mentioned large cap automobile companies. They will either have stagnant growth this year or will have only moderate growth. Please note that this growth will be because of a lower base last year, since this time last year, the sales were very low due of lockdowns. All said, even if these companies show growth in numbers by a small amount, this won‚Äôt mean much. This will probably not be equal to or greater than the pre-covid numbers. The automobile sector is in dire need of getting back up on its feet, but it will happen slowly. -Mudit ‚ÄòMoody‚Äô Agarwal.",https://stockmarketinindia.quora.com/How-is-the-chip-shortage-affecting-Indian-stocks,,,,,

The process Rudolph Lindt   invented the process of conching, refining the texture of chocolate by warming it and then grinding it between rollers.

Jeff Bezos,Who would win in a fight: Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk?,"This is actually a really interesting question to answer. First of all,it is necessary for us to understand what kind of fight we are talking about??? Is the fight a physical one or the fight is about achievements or about the assets that are owned by them. The first and foremost thing about these two guys that we should acknowledge is that both are extremely brilliant and ambitious.Jeff has already done his part of hard work and Musk is going through the suffering phase.Hence ,the physical tussle will might give positive results for Jeff Bezos. Now, talking about the achievements,Jeff will definitely have a upper hand as he has expanded his business in different sectors by acquiring WholeFoods, IMDb, Washington Post & Blue Origins. Amazon is the largest Internet retailer in the World in terms of revenue.Only Amazon Web Services‚Äô revenue amounted to nearly US$35.03 billion in 2019 and it is a dominant player in cloud computing .On the other hand ,Elon Musk always find himself in the middle of controversies courtesy his Twitter account where he put random shit every now and then or the one where he was smoking weed on YouTube host Joe Rogan‚Äôs show. Every time one of his ventures suffer a setback, he comes up with a new idea to deviate the attention of masses and most importantly his investors. Although after successfully selling PayPal to eBay in 2002 for US$1.5 billion,he invested his share of money received in Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink ,Solar City and The Boring Company.However his tweets and actions put his companies in bad light ,the recent being his tweet regarding share price of Tesla wiped nearly US$15 billion of Tesla's valuation.  So,the picture is quite clear Jeff Bezos is in the condition to win a fight against Elon Musk even on his worst day because he is the richest person on earth with US$151.6 billion and definitely a man with US$36.5 billion will not be able to stand in front of him that too coupled with weird behavior and overvalued companies.

Tech Scalpers,Why are so many people disappointed in Cyberpunk 2077?,"Because people like to dream and avoid the fact that reality is a bitch; Open world games are always full of bugs on first day release.  Always . The callout technology sitting behind the game (raytracing/DLSS and a step increase in brute rendering performance), has not really been used to this level elsewhere, and when it has, it has been with totally different types of games that are level based (for that, read ‚Äòsimpler to test for bugs‚Äô). Nobody except gullible hype-believing idiots expected Project Red to build (a) an open world game (b) using new hardware and (c) not expect many bugs on first release. When you expect many bugs because it is an open world  and  also expect another set of bugs because it is a first use of technology,  the bugs will compound each other giving you the product of the two bug types, not the sum.  This is to be expected, and what we are seeing. More than most games, Cyberpunk is a showcase for current gen GPUs/CPUs and consoles. Such hardware is in short supply. There are always people that try to run a current AAA game on trailing tech and fail miserably, but for Cyberpunk, this is 90% of the userbase  because nobody can buy the damn hardware at the moment!  Even worse, although raytracing now works, it only works well on the high end hardware that only 1% of the userbase actually own. I don‚Äôt think this hardware iteration is the one that will make raytracing mainstream (I‚Äôm talking about PC users here, not consoles) because although it now works, it is still  too expensive if you want it to work without a serious hit on FPS/resolution . This affects games like Cyberpunk that have gone all-in on raytracing. You have to realise that NVidia almost certainly paid Project Red a lot of money (in support and close dev association) to put standout features into this game so it would be a tentpole release for Nvidia. This will have affected the game in other areas, making a great looking game, but that didn‚Äôt leave enough time for the deep RPG (emergent behaviour, responsive character AI, etc) that some may have expected. You can‚Äôt have two big new things in one game. Maybe for v2. I‚Äôve played the game‚Ä¶ On a i7‚Äì980X (a 10 year old CPU!) and a GTX980 (2 generations away!). When I first ran the game, I was getting really low FPS. Most games select a default resolution for my GPU of 1440p. Cyberpunk selected 2160p (UHD or ‚Äò4k‚Äô) and maxed out settings, which is a really bad call - every PC user will boot into a game that displays the lowest performance they will see, causing instant regret and buyers remorse. You have to immediately go online and see how to optimise the settings, because the defaults are awful for FPS and immediate crashes (plus overheat slowdowns). Not the best initial user experience! Here‚Äôs the thing - I couldn‚Äôt tell it was running on 4k! On 1440p, you can hardly tell the difference in step down. I went all the way down to 1080p. I could still hardly tell, unless I played it on my 32 inch screen. Cyberpunk is one of those games that uses so much post processing that resolution pretty much doesn't matter . Once you set the resolution low, most of your hardware problems disappear - you actually get a good gaming experience and can max out the graphical settings. The only immersion breaking thing I actually notice that is a little bit of unsharpness on character eyes at 1080p. Distant structures are not a problem because I have DOF set, and I see no staircasing simply because of the level of post the game uses. The most annoying thing is looking down the crosshairs of some of the weapons - if like me you prefer stealth and planning in your RPGs, you may be shooting at a long distance blur! The other issue I had was because I have an old processor that doesn't support advanced instructions. A simple google for  AVX fix  got me the solution (I‚Äôm used to having to do this for the i7‚Äì980X!). Since then zero problems. The updates are coming in faster than my progression in the game, so I‚Äôm sure bugs ahead of my gameplay are being fixed before I experience them. I‚Äôm on 1.04 as of this writing EDIT- How To get decent performance in Cyberpunk 2077 on an older PC I hate negative rage-answers, so instead, here‚Äôs some sunshine via fixes I currently run with to make the game greater than even The Donald would think possible‚Ä¶ NB - By ‚Äòolder‚Äô I mean ‚Äòdoesn‚Äôt have a fast RTX2000 or RTX3000 card in it‚Äô. First, if you have a  really  old CPU like my i7‚Äì980X, you will also need to do the AVX fix. Google; friend. (NB - 1.05 fix already has this) Next, lets fix the overly pessimistic Cyberpunk config file. Have a look at this link; it fixes low FPS problems on PC due to bad config shipping in early releases (v1.0 to 1.04). On my machine it allows me to go to go from ~20fps to 30‚Äì40fps on 1440p. Almost, but not quite playable‚Ä¶ works well as a walking simulator until you get into gunfights or into a vehicle! (NB - I believe 1.05 also addresses this)  Next, you can edit the hidden developer settings. download the config overhaul application here  Config Overhaul for Cyberpunk 2077 . Copy it into the root install folder and run it.  This application lists all the ‚Äòhidden developer flags that should really be in the graphics settings because they lose you serious FPS‚Äô (aka ‚ÄòWTF - who puts anti-aliasing in as a hidden developer toggle?!‚Äô). You can uncheck them one by one or select one of the defaults at the top ( Very low ,  Low ,  Optimised , or  Disable Async computer only ). If you have a GPU prior to the RTX cards (i.e. a GTX1000 series or lower), disable the Async compute. Don‚Äôt worry, the  Reset  button at the end will reset all the changes so it can‚Äôt bork your game install. Keep an eye on quality as you use this tool. It gets rid of screen space reflections, a feature that make the game still look good on non-RTX cards‚Ä¶ which is why I keep SSR (and SSAO) on. NB - none of these controls seem to be exposed nor optimised for non RTX cards in 1.05 nor 1.06 updates). NB - there are some shady versions of this application on the web; use the one from the link above only; its from the reputable Nexus mods and the original version of the app. Next up, optimising graphics settings Once you have fixed the game hardware resource and developer config files, you can play around with detail settings to get you up to a solid 60FPS. Cyberpunk does not display framerate/cpu load statistics. You can overlay them with Steam or Riva/Afterburner, with the latter being better because it gives you more display options (google ‚ÄòMSI Afterburner show OSD‚Äô for YouTube videos that show you how to set this up). I managed to get the same sort of performance I was seeing in a comparable AAA open world game that I have already optimised (Assassins‚Äôs Creed Odyssey and Valhalla);  (I‚Äôve uploaded this as a full sized 1440p screenshot, click it to see my level of detail) The Afterburner/Riva OSD (On Screen Display) in the top left corner looks like this;  I‚Äôm seeing  stable  50‚Äì60FPS when in built up areas of the city (high number of pedestrians and detail, so so lots of people, cars and incidental features). This is at 1440p, most settings  High  or  Ultra . My GPU doesn‚Äôt support raytracing/DLSS so that is off‚Ä¶ but my gangsta hack for that is to just play the game with the screen a little darker and get a nice Blade runner cyber-noir ambience whilst avoiding paying current scalpers fees! Inside buildings, it is 60FPS  solid . Most importantly, I never go below 50FPS in combat at 1440p, which seriously improved my game, as I can now use the weapon crosshairs accurately, and without having to shoot blurry distant objects via a gun in treacle! Here‚Äôs the most important setting that achieved this on my older machine; Either Static FidelityFX CAS;  ‚Ä¶ or Dynamic FidelityFX CAS;  I previously ignored  Static FidelityFX CAS  because I thought it was AMD only, but it has a  large effect  if you are running GTX nVidia and need to seriously increase your FPS. It is basically DLSS for non RTX cards (renders at a lower resolution then upscales with sharpening, but I don‚Äôt think it has an AI upscaler). As Cyberpunk uses lots of post processing that makes the game very unsharp (lots of glow, haze and DOF) anyway, you can go down to around 70% with minimal lack of detail but a massive increase in FPS. Just remember to set texture detail quite high if you use FidelityFX (NB - texture quality can only be set when you go to settings from the main menu; they are missing if you pause and go to settings in-game). Set everything to  Medium , then whilst in a built up area (typically the center of the city) keep decreasing the  Resolution Scaling  until you are getting a solid 60FPS. then increase quality settings towards  High / Ultra  until you are getting an acceptable drop for quality (for me that was -10FPS; I am happy to go down to 50FPS for better graphics). By this time, your GPU should be hitting 95‚Äì99% and your CPU close to 70‚Äì75%. That tells you you are using your hardware efficiently and therefore getting the best output you will see given your system. By ‚Äòlarge effect‚Äô, I mean Static FidelityFX CAS can literally increase your FPS by 30‚Äì50%. All other settings don‚Äôt more the FPS by more than 1‚Äì3% each. So quite a find, and a serious option if you have sluggish performance or want to go up a resolution to make gunfighting using the iron sights more accurate. Dynamic FidelityFX CAS  choses the reduced render level automatically. Just set your target FPS and a minimum and leave maximum render scaling at 100%. The minimum is whatever you fancy, but not much less than 65‚Äì70% in my experience. The dynamic version would be your preferred option over static, but its wise to play with the static version first to find out which detail settings are optimal for your system before you stick it all on auto via dynamic. As a side note - I hope FidelityFX CAS makes its way to more games; it is clearly a way to give life to all those GTX nVidia cards that are missing DLSS! I noticed that once my game was running well, many of the silly in game bugs seemed to also disappear. No more pop-ups, cars taking off or characters sliding around floors. Leads me to believe they are mostly to do with resource management and perhaps trying to access resources before they are available (or game logic threads getting out of order because of slow performance). Once you have fixed the slowness, it all becomes much more stable. The only thing I still occasionally see is the ‚Äòt-pose‚Äô bug. Finally, if you have a non RTX graphics card but want to get a somewhat raytraced rendered look, set screen space reflections and ambient occlusion to high, plus have the two shadow complexity values at medium or high. You lose around 2‚Äì4fps outdoors. I prefer to have these set and accept a lower resolution (or use FidelityFX) as the game looks better overall with good reflection/shadow settings. My mini review of the game (This assumes you have fixed all the issues with performance noted above, and now have a good looking, smooth running game with fewer bugs than most other reviews!) Looks good, plays well, but not really groundbreaking in any way other than visuals‚Ä¶ but this is mitigated by the excellent writing, which we will get onto in a moment. There is very little in the way of emergent behavior, and I didn‚Äôt notice the day-night NPC cycle you see in the Witcher (this may be because the AI lives in a large city, and do not lead ‚Äòeat-sleep-die in the same 4 acre farm in a tiny village‚Äô lives‚Ä¶). But that ignores the strong positives‚Ä¶ The best fleshed out character in the game is the city itself - the attention to detail is immense. Although parkour is not a feature of the game, you can get to the top of many buildings for example - the outer stairs and ledges are not there for show, and there is always a carefully placed (but seemingly impossible) jump that allows you to progress upwards for the brave. Cars are also very well modeled, including details you do not notice unless you look for them (underside, engine, etc). Hopefully all that stuff will be opened up in later releases. Special mention goes to Cyberpunk vs Fallout 4. Fallout has one of those open worlds that just feel empty once you finish the main story. Cyberpunk still feels alive because it has such a stylistic and narrative wholeness to it. You can walk around and feel part of a real, breathing future city. This doesn‚Äôt happen because of the AI, it happens because of the art direction and on-rails mission scripting is so good. Although you do get lots of secondary missions (and at least one point in the game where you can‚Äôt progress until you ‚Äòdo enough side mission to have enough money to be able to progress‚Äô pinch points), it never really feels repetitive. The attention to detail is not in AI, its in the writing. You always get a real victim or other emotional color in the story to propel the game forward. Some of the side missions are not small, and affect an entire faction‚Ä¶ some side missions feel like the main mission in other big open world games. You hardly ever get the stats-missions like ‚Äòcollect 5 beaver pelts‚Äô thing in Cyberpunk. One notable side mission is a straightforward ‚Äòassassinate the murderer who killed my wife‚Äô, but take it on and the story has a serious flip to it, and then an even bigger one you don‚Äôt expect. You end up fixing the problem with a hammer, some nails and some cypress wood (and its the only mission in a game where I‚Äôve actually had cause to close my eyes as I winced at a particular action I have to take). Everything has a reason, and often side missions inter-connect with lore and other missions in nice ways. The FPS gun battles are much better than other similar RPGs. They obviously spent some time getting this right, and it shows. It plays like an FPS, but the damage model is clearly using Cyberpunk-RPG rules under the hood (NB - Cyberpunk 2077 is based on an old, pen/paper RPG). No need for VATS or the pause key! Also, at the hard difficultly level, the enemy do not just become a better bullet sponge - they use more complex special moves more often. Always good when that happens, because you can increase difficulty as your character gets more buffed up‚Ä¶ and the payback is increasing immersion. Although the three character types you can choose at the beginning all have very short unique ‚Äòorigin‚Äô story arcs, the choice affects you throughout the game. I chose ‚Äòcorporate‚Äô, and that choice has implications throughout conversation options deep into the game. I think replaying as one of the other types will be an option later, which bodes well for a future play-though of the fully patched game. A nice successor to Witcher 3, but that is not the game many people are looking for. If I‚Äôd spent out serious money on a 3090 and new Ryzen, I‚Äôd be disappointed‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm on an aging 10 year old CPU and a GPU two generations back and loving it because ti now runs so well, and plays great. Still the odd bug, but not more than any other game (Assassins Creed, TC, Watchdogs etc) and far fewer than the standard culprits (Elder scrolls et al). Most people should wait until future patches are out (which to Project Reds credit is already happening - the game is  much  better already for stability and FPS)  unless you are a first adopter who is happy to get your hands dirty .  My guess is the real aim was to release now with fast updates to placate the early adopters, and make the game playable for Christmas. Shrewd move, because Most of the game purchases are currently sitting in a wrapped box at the moment!  I should note that all of this is a perspective on the PC game. I don‚Äôt own a console. Last gen base consoles seem to have more serious problems, so if you own one of those, I‚Äôd give it a miss for a good three months.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-people-disappointed-in-Cyberpunk-2077,So much detail in answering a question. nice work,"What? That's literally not why people are disappointed. People who expect an interactive world in the sense of RDR2 are the same people who think of it as a GTA clone, aka people who didnt follow development from the start.

Tech Scalpers,Is RTX 3070 equivalent to what is in the PS5?,"I happen to have just gotten an RTX 3070 and I‚Äôve had some experience with this question during the previous generation. Short Answer: The RTX is a fair bit more powerful than the PS5. You‚Äôre more likely to get closer to ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù performance from something like a RTX 2070 Super or RTX 3060. Long Answer: It‚Äôs complicated, and will no doubt depend largely on the games you play. I would still however give the average RTX card the edge on anything but Sony exclusives. Keep reading to understand why. The first thing to keep in mind is that a computer or a console are both more than just their video cards. Things like CPU, RAM, VRAM, and even the hard drive can prove bottlenecks (though the latter mostly on load times). TFLOPs are something people quote a lot but really don‚Äôt give you the whole picture. Before we talk about the latest hardware, it might be more helpful to take a look at the last generation. For a long time, the GTX 970 (and later GTX 1060) were amazing cards for the money; easily more powerful than the PS4. But when Sony launched the PS4 Pro, they had a card that was comparable to Nvidia‚Äôs value options when it came to TFLOPS. But that was simply the core computing power of the card and not the whole system. So how did multi-platform games run? Well, I found that most cross-platform titles I tried both looked better and ran smoother on my GTX 970 (and comparisons came out even better for the 1060). Western titles like your average Call of Duty, Tomb Raider, or Hitman games tended to feature higher texture quality and better LOD when running at similar frame-rates, as did even Japanese titles like RE2 Remake, DMC5, and Tekken 7. If you watched Digital Foundry, you‚Äôll find that the PS4 Pro detail settings were often equivalent to the ‚Äúmedium‚Äù or ‚Äúlow‚Äù settings of their PC counterparts. Furthermore, resolution gains were often achieved via checkboard rendering on the PS4 Pro which lacked a lot of the detail of native 4k or sometimes 1440p (though honestly neither the PS4 Pro, GTX 970, or GTX 1060 were really appropriate for native 4K gaming beyond older titles). But there was a caveat to this: Certain titles that were developed from the ground-up for Sony could take advantage of every little aspect of that hardware rather than needing to be optimized for a wide variety of PCs. So when some of these former exclusives made their way over to the PC, you might find that you‚Äôd get a better result from a PS4 Pro than a mid-level graphics card. Horizon Zero Dawn, for instance, seems to fair much better on Sony‚Äôs hardware than Nvidia when you‚Äôre comparing like for like TFLOPS (obviously a new RTX cards smoke both). So now let‚Äôs talk about the next (or current) gen: Most games are going to look better and run better on an RTX 3070 but a few titles (temporary or permanent exclusives), will probably blow you away on the PS5 like nothing else (I‚Äôm thinking of how amazing Uncharted 4 or God of War looked when they launched). These differences might further depend on your RAM and CPU situation. I tend to upgrade both categories heavily because I work in content creation where both of them are very important along with the graphics card. BUT‚Ä¶there‚Äôs still more to the story! When Nvidia introduced their new RTX cards, they also launched two very interesting bits of tech that might really change how we think of game graphics. The first is Ray Tracing which you‚Äôve probably heard about. And yes, the PS5 can do it but the hardware is based on AMD Cards which numerous benchmarks have shown perform much more slowly than their Nvidia counterparts when this feature is enabled. AND, there‚Äôs the even bigger game-changer: DLSS. This uses AI and machine learning to create an initial render at a lower resolution which is then refined by the AI that has been trained on super-computers at 16k to give a result that is often better looking than native image quality at less processing power. This is light years beyond PS4 Pro‚Äôs checkboard rendering or previous forms of AI Upscaling. I didn‚Äôt believe this until I saw it. Digital Foundry has some great comparisons but make sure you check out the ones using DLSS 2.0 because it‚Äôs a big jump over previous versions. Literally, games like Control or Death Stranding can use DLSS to render at 1440P but create an image that looks better than native 4k (thanks to the 16k AI training) and one that runs smoother (a big part comes down to how it deals with aliasing and super sampling). In titles where this is an option, the RTX cards absolutely destroy AMD GPUs (I‚Äôm not trying to get into brand wars, just stating my observation). But it‚Äôs important to remember that not every title supports DLSS yet nor does every game use ray tracing. For that matter, many gamers don‚Äôt care about ray-traced visuals. Some stylized games like Borderlands 3, for instance, do better on AMD cards because there‚Äôs no DLSS and photorealistic ray tracing doesn‚Äôt even make a lot of sense for some art styles. In general, the latest AMD cards will perform better than a similarly priced NVidia card in rasterized graphics (mean, no Ray Tracing or DLSS). UPDATE: AMD just announced their own upscaling method called FSR. Essentially it‚Äôs a more advanced version of the old upscale methods (not deep learning like DLSS). For the brief demo they showed, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed with the rather blurry results but perhaps it will improve over time. So the big question is, what kind of graphics matter to you and where do you see the technology going? I always invest in a powerful PC GPU because I want to use my hardware for more than just games (I need to for my graphics work and content creation including video, motion graphics, and 3D). If it came down to just the game performance & Ray-tracing, I might have had a harder time deciding between AMD and Nvidia (though I‚Äôd still have probably gone with the RTX series because I‚Äôm all about sophisticated lighting). However, DLSS really feels like a game-changer. It‚Äôs not perfect but, if more games start using it, then it could mean you‚Äôll get a lot more out of an RTX card than a PS5 or Xbox Series X. There‚Äôs also something to be said about never having to worry about if the next generation is going to be backwards compatible. PS5 is but PS4 wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs nice to know that my Steam library isn‚Äôt going anywhere and I can still bust out the first title I ever bought on it back in 2005. Even just for games, I tend to think an RTX card is a more value-conscious long-term investment (especially because you can usually find PC games for cheaper). But this calculation changes as consoles drop in price (my family got me a PS4 when it went down to $250 and it was well worth it at that price). Yikes, it‚Äôs insane that I‚Äôve written this much, especially given the fact that you‚Äôre unlikely to find either a PS5 or RTX3070 anywhere in stock (unless you‚Äôre willing to pay an insane mark-up on Ebay or from a scalper). Unless you‚Äôre planning to buy a pre-built/customized PC some time soon (which seems like the only way you can get one with a modern GPU for something close to MSRP), you might as well just wait 6 months to a year and see where the technology goes.",https://www.quora.com/Is-RTX-3070-equivalent-to-what-is-in-the-PS5,,,,,

Age of Empires 4,What is the most awesome Microsoft product? Why?,"Microsoft Excel.
Can you think of modern management and finance without Excel? On surface, it is quite simple, but yet incredibly powerful. From accounting to data analysis to portfolio management to project management, Excel finds use in a myriad of different ways. Although many specialized tools exist to do these independent operations, many managers still prefer Excel as the do-all.  In the 30 years since it was introduced (originally called the Multiplan in 1982) it has grown to be the undisputed market leader and with no major alternatives. Even many of Microsoft's staunch critics grudgingly install this in their Macs and use it.

Chip Shortage,"When chip shortages hit the computer industry, why is it so hard to simply increase production?","First, a chip factory has a design limit on how many wafers can processed per week. It is designed to run 24/7 since the equipment is so expensive. So once the factory is running at that capacity there is nothing more that can be done. You can‚Äôt ‚Äúspeed up‚Äù the production line. A good place to read about all the issues is in Wikipedia ‚ÄúSemiconductor Fabrication‚Äù. If a factory is not full, then new material can be started just by making sure that there is sufficient manpower and sufficient raw materials. Often than can happen in just a month or two. But the process is a long one. The latest processes often take 3 months to get wafers from beginning to finished chips. This past year the chip factories were full because customers had forecast low demand during the pandemic. So semiconductor companies mothballed some factories and allowed employees to stay home. Then everybody discovered that the pandemic increased demand! Oh damn, we have to restart factories (I think some were even closed permanently.). Finally it is hard for semiconductor companies to believe sudden increases in demand. It has happened many times and it is often the result of double ordering where customers place orders directly with the factory and also through distributors. Anyway, much of the shortage is due to unexpected increases in demand. I also suggest that you see if you can find a shortage. What car production lines are shutdown?

Chip Shortage,When will retail car prices (increased because of chip shortage) come down in the USA?,"The chip shortage is but one part of a complicated supply chain and market. It is highly unlikely that prices will come down in the US in the near future. The supply of both new and used cars is diminished as a result of COVID-glibal-pandemic-related social and labor permutations. People are hanging on to their old cars, people are working from home or hybrid situations more often, kids do not have as many social activities, adults ditto. Rental car companies, which tradyionally infuse the used car market with reliable newer model used cars is also lagging. About the only factors bringing newer model used cars into the resale market are lease end and repossessions. Production interruptions not related to chips has affected the assembly lines for new cars. I am no economist, but practical observations over a relatively long life says to me that: once the market bears a higher price, those prices continue to hold sway. We have easy money, still, in terms of very low interest rates, which means the majority of the buying populace that buys cars on payments will be able to pay those higher prices because they are just ""pennies a day"" higher. I am in more sticker shock over the price of groceries than the price of cars.

Chip Shortage,Is it possible that the electronic chip shortage will bring the automobile industry to a standstill causing a recession?,"The auto IC chips shortage is a problem, but not a serious problem in my opinions. It certainly won‚Äôt cause recession. Fundamentally, it is an economic supply and demand issue. Auto IC chips are based on mature technology (e.g. 28nm) with lower profit margin. Big foundries like TSMC or Samsung focus on higher margin items (e.g. 5 or 7nm process.) China‚Äôs foundry like SMIC, while is behind TSMC and Samsung technologically, can produce auto IC chips by using mature technology. US technology cold war on China, including SMIC, was preventing its expansions. In the meantime, South Korea-Japan trade dispute had caused Japan to place export restriction of needed chemical to Samsung. It seriously disrupted the global supply of IC chips. If the auto makers are willing to pay higher price of their chips, then the supply and demand issue will be resolved naturally. But they want the cake and eat it too so US government pressure companies like TSMC to move portion of their production to lower margin auto IC chips. TSMC does yield to such pressure to some extent. In the meantime, TSMC is making plan to expand its China Nanjing foundry with the focus of 28nm IC production for auto chips purpose. On the other hand, US is allowing SMIC to acquire Dutch ASML DUV lithography machines which is capable making chips of 14nm process and higher. In the short term, if auto makers want to resolve the chip shortage issue, they can pay higher price as how a free market system should work. If not, they can either cutoff others by using political pressure or be nice and wait, the problem will be resolved in a few years anyway. In a bigger picture, the global supply chain is facing challenge as nations are interfering free market systems based on political considerations. This will lead to each nation want to establish their own supply chain for safety reason. This trend to decoupling is less efficient and will drive up cost and slow economic growth on the long run.",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-the-electronic-chip-shortage-will-bring-the-automobile-industry-to-a-standstill-causing-a-recession,,,,,

If you frequent gaming and hardware sites, you'll see lots best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card buzz around ""4K gaming"" on new high-end monitors, as well as the rise best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card more-affordable 1440p (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) displays. Spend long enough in those parts, and you might assume that high-res gaming and expensive, monster video cards rule the PC-gaming world. Not so! Yes, they are important, and yes, they are the eventual future‚Äîwhen they get cheaper, much cheaper. For the foreseeable future, though, playing at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or ""full HD"") will remain the sweet spot for most PC gamers. Today, 1080p monitors are affordable‚Äîyou can find plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 'em down around $100‚Äîand even a midrange video card can run the latest games on one best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these displays with a silky-smooth frame rate. In fact, according to the latest Steam Hardware Survey results, 1080p remains by far the most common native display resolution for PC gamers on the service, outranking all other resolutions combined. The truth is, though most gamers would love to play at the highest resolution possible, buying both a high-res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or 1440p display and a video card that can ace gaming at that higher resolution will cost you plenty. (One depends on the other.) Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card us just want our games to look good and run smoothly, and that's much less expensive to achieve at the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This resolution has been the de facto standard for gaming for some time now, and it will stay that way until cheap 1440p monitors become much more common, or 4K-capable graphics cards become reasonably affordable. (At this writing, gaming at 4K resolution with leading PC titles was impossible to achieve with a card costing much less than $400, unless you were willing to dial back on the detail settings.) So purchasing a video card that can run games at a smooth clip at 1080p is a solid investment, one that should keep you happy for at least a few years, if not longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A Competitive Field Just one problem: Since 1080p is such a popular resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video cards are competing for the top spot in the category. The field best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p graphics cards is more granular as 2021 opens up than it's ever been, with nearly a dozen different card classes (defined by their different core graphics processors) to choose from. But that's where we come in. We'll walk you through the features you need to pay attention to when shopping for a 1080p-ideal video card, and outline the best cards we've tested for gaming at this resolution, given your budget. The good news? Nvidia's introduction best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing""-generation video cards back in 2018 and 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" line best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has meant better 1080p power than ever for under $300. Nvidia also, in mid-to-late 2018, introduced its first cards in its new GeForce RTX line, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and GeForce RTX 2070, as well as an expensive, elite-class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these have been augmented and, in some cases, replaced by newer, mid-2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, as well as the newest RTX 30 Series cards like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070.) While these high-end cards will run any game very nicely at 1080p, they are mighty, mighty overkill for this resolution, starting at‚Äîin theory, anyway‚Äî$499 for cards based on the RTX 3070 and around $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or list prices, and seldom the going rate at the moment; due to silicon shortages and the activities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it's pricing pandemonium out there right now.) But even with higher prices than normal here in 2021, you don't need to spend anything like that for 1080p play...in most cases. Buying Basics: What to Look for in a 1080p Card Most cards that are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming ring up at between $100 and $300 at this writing. Pricier cards will certainly do the job, too. But the further you get above $300, the more into overkill territory you've gone for most games. Here are the key factors in play. How Much Video Memory Is Enough? The amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card graphics memory (or video RAM) that your video card has onboard directly affects the resolution at which you can game smoothly, as well as the detail settings that are possible. The overall power best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the graphics processing unit (commonly called the ""GPU"") on the card dictates how well you can run a specific game at certain settings, too. But think best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the video memory as a freeway that opens up lanes for the GPU to work its magic without getting congested. Without enough video memory, the GPU will be constrained, unable to perform at its maximum potential. The reason: The video card actually crunches all the pixels that go onto the screen while they are in memory. So, the more data that's needed, either for a certain resolution or to display more detail in a game, the more memory is required to handle it efficaciously. That's why high-end video cards tend to have more on-card memory; more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it is needed to manage all the pixels that render games at higher resolutions and at higher detail settings. Generally speaking, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video memory is an adequate minimum, but 4GB is much better. In cards under $300 nowadays, you'll see graphics memory ranging from 1GB up to 8GB. A few best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the key cards for 1080p gaming come in 3GB/6GB and 4GB/8GB variants. Going with a card that has 6GB or 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is fine, but don't expect miracles, as performance generally does not improve by a whole lot in cards at this resolution versus 3GB or 4GB, all else being equal. Leveraging the extra memory only applies in certain games and under certain circumstances. So don't spend the money on any more RAM or GPU power than you need. For 1080p play, opting for a 3GB or 4GB card should suffice, unless you intend to upgrade your monitor to a 1440p or 4K screen in the near future. But if that's the case, you'll want a card that's equipped with a more powerful GPU, too. Which Ports Does My Graphics Card Need? All the standard outputs on today's graphics cards (VGA, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort) support 1080p resolution. In most cases, you'll just need to pick a card that has a port matching what's on your monitor. It's not until you get into resolutions higher than 1080p that it's possible to start exceeding the capabilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card some interfaces, such as VGA and older versions best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. If you're sticking to 1080p, you shouldn't have much cause for concern or confusion, since all cards and most monitors these days have multiple ports. Chances are, you'll be able to just plug in and go; at worst, if you're upgrading from an old system or card, you may need a new cable or an adapter. So keep these things in mind while you're shopping. Both DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 can support 1080p resolution up to a 240Hz refresh rate, so if playing games at a high refresh rate is your main concern (more on that in a moment), make sure you pick up a card and a cable that are appropriate for this aim. However neither HDMI 2.0 nor HDMI 2.1 can support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b and above can handle that job), so make sure if you buy an elite, cutting-edge monitor like the Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you have the right GPU and cable for the job. Bottom view graphics card Also realize, if you're making the move for the first time away from DVI or VGA, that the HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces can carry an audio signal; if your display has built-in speakers (or is an HDTV), that can eliminate some cabling complexity. How Much Should I Spend on My Graphics Card? This is a moving target, but it's safe to say you can expect to drop between $100 and $300 on a 1080p-appropriate video card here in 2021, depending on whether you want to run games at the very highest settings, or closer to medium ones. If you're interested in enabling anti-aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged lines from the edges best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in-game objects, you'll need to spend toward the higher end best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the range, especially if you want to crank up the AA settings as high as possible. (AA tends to be demanding.) If you're content with just average detail settings and frame rates, by all means adhere to a strict budget. But if you want maximum detail and AA at 1080p, you'll probably need to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The pricing on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream graphics cards hasn't gone quite as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX and AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards, but you'll still see a premium over list price, in many cases. Should I Get an AMD or an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and Nvidia have strong best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, between $100 and $400, though we give Nvidia an edge for hitting more price points within the range with solid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so long as you're sticking to both companies' latest-gen cards, it's hard to pick a bad one for 1080p in that price span. On the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front, we also give Nvidia the win, but it's a near-run thing nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware is slick, lets you record in-game video easily with its Shadowplay feature, and updates your drivers for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install). Nvidia's sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware also helps you join co-op games quickly and easily. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware boasts similar capabilities, and the company's driver sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware is a clear improvement over the Catalyst app from days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There's no longer as much daylight between Team Green (Nvidia) and Team Red (AMD) on this score as in previous years. Also worth considering: the competing image-smoothing technologies, FreeSync (AMD) and G-Sync (Nvidia). If you have a new monitor that supports one or the other, that would be a vital reason to choose one chip company over the another. That said, you can currently find a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors that are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia now supports under its G-Sync image-smoothing tech; these displays are dubbed ""G-Sync Compatible."" Then there's sharpening tech. This addition to gamers' arsenals is the perfect way to pinch every bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you can out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a card. What they do, in a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby increasing performance by up to 30 percent on the same card), without sacrificing visual fidelity in the process. Currently, the two competing technologies from Nvidia and AMD are called Freestyle and Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Gaming hardware inside 2020 is very potent and will provide over four GB video clip mind.

Sekiro isn't very challenging with regards to videos mind and can work all right on a two GB GPU. Respawn Entertainment, noted for improving the Titanfall franchise, got a great deal best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card compliments for their innovating recording aspects within the single player plan. As soon as the discharge best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card Titanfall two, Respawn made the decision which the following energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs will be considered a character based Battle Royale game known as Apex Legends. The game were introduced to small amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card marketing but became a huge results after introduction. It actually unseated Fornite as essentially the most streamed game on Twitch for some time. It's a great Battle Royale game that provides figures that are special as well as motivates staff play all through a match up. It's very challenging inside terminology best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card hardware but a two GB GPU must be adequate to operate the game. #1 The Witcher three: The Wild Hunt Nearly 5 many years right after the discharge best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its, The Witcher three consistently be probably the most well known video games within the gaming group. It was actually proclaimed as the Game on the Year in 2015 and it is even now deemed among the best PC video games within the story best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card gaming. The Witcher three was a remarkable feat by CD Projekt Reddish as they shipped what's probably the the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card content rich open world game best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card precious time. Having an outrageous amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card edge quests, this specific game just can't be skipped. The game is not overly challenging and also a two GB GPU is going to do all right to operate the masterpiece. Should you regular gaming and also hardware web sites, you will observe plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card talk around ""4K gaming"" on innovative top monitors, and the rise best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card more affordable 1440p (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) displays. Invest much time sufficient inside the components, as well as you may think that high res gaming as well as costly, monster video clip cards rule the PC gaming planet. Not! Indeed, they're crucial, along with best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card course, they're the final long term - once they obtain less expensive, a lot less expensive. For that direct long term, although, actively playing at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or maybe ""full HD"") will continue to be the sweet-tasting area for nearly all PC game enthusiasts. Nowadays, 1080p monitors are inexpensive - you are able to discover a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card' em down about hundred dolars - as well as a midrange video clip flash memory card is able to operate the newest video games on among the displays having a silky smooth frame pace. Actually, based on the most recent Steam Hardware Survey benefits, 1080p stays undoubtedly the most typical indigenous screen resolution for PC game enthusiasts along the program, outranking any other resolutions together. The fact is, although nearly all game enthusiasts will really like playing within the greatest resolution achievable, purchasing equally a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or maybe 1440p screen as well as a video flash memory card that will ace gaming at which greater resolution will set you back plenty. (One is determined by the other.) Most people only desire the video games best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours to look great & operate easily, along with that is less costly to attain within the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This particular resolution continues to be the de facto standard format for gaming for a few moment today, as well as it is going to stay in that way before inexpensive 1440p monitors turn out to be a lot more prevalent, or maybe 4K capable visuals cards come to be sensibly affordable. (At this particular posting, gaming at 4K resolution with directing PC titles was not possible to attain with a flash memory card being significantly under $400, except if you are ready to dial back again along the information settings.) So buying a video recording flash memory card which can operate video games with a sleek clip at 1080p is a good purchase, one which ought to keep you pleased for no less than a couple best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yrs, or even longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive by nature Field Only one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a favorite resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards are fighting for that high area within the class. The area best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p visuals cards tends to be more granular as 2021 opens as compared to what it has been, with almost a dozen various flash memory card courses (defined by their various primary visuals processors) to select from. But that is exactly where we are available in. We will take you step the functions you have to give consideration to when looking for a 1080p ideal video clip flash memory card, as well as outline probably the very best cards we have subjected to testing for gaming only at that resolution, provided with the spending budget best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. The best part? Nvidia's launch best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing"" generation video clip cards in 2018 as well as 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" brand best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has intended much better 1080p strength compared to actually for less than $300. Nvidia too, for mid-to-late 2018, launched the 1st cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its inside its brand new GeForce RTX type, which includes the GeForce RTX 2080 as well as GeForce RTX 2070, plus a costly, elite class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most these were augmented as well as, in some instances, supplanted by new, mid 2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, plus the newest RTX thirty Series cards such as the RTX 3080 and also RTX 3070.) While these top cards will go some game quite well from 1080p, they're mighty, mighty overkill for this particular resolution, beginning at - for concept, anyhow - $499 for cards in line with the RTX 3070 and also approximately $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or maybe record costs, along with hardly ever the living price on the moment; because best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tasks and silicon shortages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it is rates pandemonium available appropriate now.) But despite having increased charges than regular right here inside 2021, you do not have to invest something that way for 1080p play...in the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card instances. Purchasing Basics: What you should Search for in a 1080p Card Most cards which are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming band in place during somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 in this particular penning. Pricier cards will definitely get the job done, as well. However the additional you receive above $300, the greater in overkill territory you have absent for many activities. Listed here are the primary key aspects in deep play. Just how much Video Memory Is sufficient? The quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card visuals mind (or maybe video clip RAM) which the video flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has onboard exclusively impacts the resolution during that you are able to game effortlessly, and the information options which are attainable. The general energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the visuals processing device (commonly named the ""GPU"") over the flash memory card decides exactly how healthy you are able to operate a certain game during specific ways, also. But think about the video clip mind as an interstate which opens lanes for the GPU to your workplace the secret best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its without becoming congested. With no sufficient video clip mind, the GPU will probably be constrained, not able to do at the optimum opportunity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its. The reason: The video clip flash memory card basically crunches all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels which go upon the display while they're within mind. Thus, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card information that is required, both for a particular resolution or even in order to show much more information inside a game, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mind is necessary to deal with it efficaciously. That is the reason why top videos cards generally have much more on card memory; much more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it's necessary to handle all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels which make video games from greater resolutions as well as at increased information configurations. Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the time, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording mind is a sufficient bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. Inside cards below $300 today, you will notice pictures mind which range from 1GB as big as 8GB. Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the crucial cards for 1080p gaming are available in 3GB/6GB as well as 4GB/8GB versions. Continuing withusing a flash memory card that's 6GB or maybe 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is okay, but do not count on wonders, as overall performance typically doesn't enhance by a good deal best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards in this particular resolution as opposed to 4GB or 3GB, everything else remaining the same. Using the excess remembering just is true within activities that are certain as well as beneath particular instances. And so do not invest the cash on much more GPU or RAM strength as compared to what you will need. For 1080p play, choosing 4GB flash memory card or a 3GB ought to be adequate, except if you plan to update the computer monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours to a 1440p or maybe 4K display within the future. But when that is the situation, you will desire a flash memory card that is designed with an impressive GPU, as well. What Ports Does The Graphics Card Need best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? Many best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the common outputs on present day visuals cards (VGA, HDMI, DVI, and also DisplayPort) help 1080p resolution. Inside the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card instances, you will merely have to decide on a flash memory card which has a port corresponding what is on the computer monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. it is not before you receive interested in resolutions above 1080p It is feasible to begin exceeding the abilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card certain interfaces, for example more mature types and VGA best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. In case you are following 1080p, you should not have a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card purpose for misunderstandings or problem, after all the cards and many monitors the times have numerous ports. Odds are, you will have the ability to simply turn on as well as go; at toughest, in case you are updating out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a well used flash memory card or telephone system, you might need to have a brand new cable or maybe an adapter. Thus hold the items in view while you are going shopping. Each DisplayPort 1.4 as well as HDMI 2.0 may help support 1080p resolution further up to a 240Hz refresh fee, therefore when taking part in video games with an impressive refresh pace will be your primary problem (more on which inside a moment), ensure you buy a cable and a flash memory card which are suitable for this particular goal. However neither HDMI 2.0 neither HDMI 2.1 may help support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b as well as previously mentioned works with the task), as get certain in case a best is bought by you, cutting edge computer monitor such as Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you've the proper GPU and also cable for the project. Bottom part perspective visuals flash memory card Also recognize, in case you are generating the action initially from VGA or DVI, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces are able to bring a sound signal; in case the screen best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has pre-made speakers (or perhaps is an HDTV), that could get rid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a few cabling intricacy. Just how much Can I Pay for The Graphics Card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? This's a moving goal, though it is safe and sound to mention you are able to look to lower somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 during a 1080p appropriate video clip flash memory card right here inside 2021, based on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you wish to jog video games in the really top configurations, and nearer to moderate heels. in case you are keen on allowing anti aliasing (AA), that smooths jagged collections coming from the tips best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you will have to invest to the bigger conclusion on the stove, particularly if you wish to crank upwards the AA options as large as possible. (AA happens to be demanding.) If you are articles with only typical information options as well as frame fees, by almost all signifies comply with a tight spending budget. But in case you'd like optimum information as well as AA at 1080p, you will most likely have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The rates on mainstream, 1080p capable mainstream visuals cards has not eliminated as bananas as it's for the higher end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 sequence cards, though you will nonetheless view a high quality over record selling price, within circumstances that are most . Can I Get an AMD or perhaps an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have powerful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $400, although we provide Nvidia an advantage for striking additional cost areas inside the number with good best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so very long as you are following each companies' latest gen cards, it is difficult to choose a defective body for 1080p within that particular price tag span. Along the supporting sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front side, we additionally create Nvidia the earn, though it is a near run point these days. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program is slick, enables you to capture in game video recording very easily with the Shadowplay function best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its, as well as revisions the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they are prepared to install). Nvidia's sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program additionally assists you to sign up co op video games easily and quickly. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware features very similar features, and also the business's car owner program is an obvious enhancement above the Catalyst app from days or weeks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There is not the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daytime in between Team Greenish (Nvidia) as well as Team Reddish (AMD) with this rating as inside prior seasons. Additionally well worth considering: the fighting image smoothing solutions, FreeSync (AMD G Sync as well as) (Nvidia). If perhaps you've an interesting computer monitor which supports just one or perhaps another, which could be an important motive to pick out a single chip business above the someone else. which stated, you are able to presently discover a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but that Nvidia today supports beneath the G-Sync best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its image smoothing tech; the displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is honing tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best method to pinch each little bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card efficiency you are able to from a flash memory card. Whatever they do, inside a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby improving overall performance by as much as thirty % on exactly the same card), without passing up on visible fidelity within the meditation process. At present, the 2 fighting solutions coming from Nvidia along with AMD belong in the Freestyle as well as Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, along with every has the own advantages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its & disadvantages. Lastly, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only element, the frame rate prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits (averaging anyplace in between five % as well as forty % within several cases) might appear tempting to anybody attempting to buy the best through best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs in deep 1080p gaming. Nevertheless, DLSS is usually enhanced as well as tuned along the motor aspect for 1440p or maybe 4K resolutions, since all those position by far the most to get as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tech. Gaming systems made in 1080p do visit an increase, without a doubt concerning that here, however the prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits tend to be less apparent wearing 1080p and sometimes do not do adequate to rationalize the gap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cost between a ""GTX"" branded flash memory card as well as a ""RTX"" branded card. (The RTXs will be the merely types which include the essential Tensor cores making all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the secret happen.) If you are a 1080p game player, we would suggest moving by using a more costly GTX design instead best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card having to pay additional for a lower end RTX type within the hopes which Nvidia provides DLSS assistance for all the video games you wish playing a place lowered by the series. We will enter the latest gen AMD as well as Nvidia cards targeted toward 1080p below as well as bust away the flash memory card courses in deep play right now by cost. Can I Get an Overclocked Card, or maybe a Reference Card? Within the realm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a visuals chip (AMD or maybe Nvidia) designs a GPU and (usually) a sufficient cool mechanism best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card. This's viewed as being a ""reference design,"" the baseline type on the flash memory card with absolutely nothing excessively snazzy added, operating during secure rates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card speed. After the chip developer models this particular standard package deal, it hands from the layout to the associates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, MSI, or maybe Sapphire) to make use best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card as being a ""reference"" or maybe ""stock"" design and style for the own list cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Usually, the businesses are going to best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards depending on this particular standard style, but additionally crank away more expensive, higher performance designs which are overclocked. The guide layout typically is going to have AMD or maybe Nvidia branding someplace along the flash memory card, as well as appear reserved in contrast to the more aggressive styles with the older followers, unusual shrouds, as well as the maker's personal branding a lot more visible compared to Nvidia's or perhaps AMD's. With the second cards, the bigger, more complicated cooling hardware over the rii may let them work less hot, as well, giving much more headroom for overclocking, that may create a little increase in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the cards are overclocked appropriate from the box.) As remarkable as these tricked out cards could be, they are able to be louder compared to inventory designs, as well as listed greater. If you actually love the specific appearance best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a certain unit (to showcase, point out, inside a windowed PC case), or maybe you understand out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card an evaluation that you are especially remarkable, we would recommend doing a bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card going shopping investigation. More best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten than not, the money best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours is a bit better expended stepping as much as a flash memory card having a higher end GPU, still in case it is an inventory layout, instead best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a likewise listed, snazzier looking overclocked flash memory card based on a lower end (or maybe previous generation) visuals chip. What's My Monitor's Refresh Rate, as well as Why Will it Matter? Remember that many best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the 1080p card recommendation best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours is dependant about the presumption that you will be consuming a regular computer monitor having a refresh price best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 60Hz. Should you entail using (or even before long upgrade to) a screen board having a greater refresh speed, like among the deluxe 120Hz, 144Hz, 240Hz, or perhaps 360Hz sections today along the computer monitor sector, you will probably have to have a higher end flash memory card than the to obtain the total advantage best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these displays. (See the picks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours for the most effective gaming monitors.) Frame rates above sixty frames a next (fps) will display easily on these sections, as well as you will wish to consider gaming examination outcomes for a concept best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the sustained frame fees you'll probably receive with any flash memory card. Although you are able to discover 4K monitors which have the ability to commercially thrust upward associated with a 144Hz refresh speed at 4K resolution, all those displays are related to a Ferrari as opposed to your regular gamer's Subaru. For that great bulk best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card players, high-refresh-rate gaming life on the planet best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p. No matter whether it has 144Hz, 165Hz, or maybe 240Hz, the 1080p displays within the types are listed about within the assortment best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card $150 to $700, along with according to the game you are actively playing, have to have a lesser or greater GPU which can fit the result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Essentially, a high refresh computer monitor is able to really exhibit all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the frames a next a flash memory card will best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten spend, up towards the monitor's refresh rate cap, which happens to be a boon for smoothness wearing instances that are most as well as a huge action in place through the 60Hz cap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card standard monitors. Mega-popular web video games for instance Counter Strike:GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these have been augmented and, in some cases, replaced by newer, mid-2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, as well as the newest RTX 30 Series cards like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070.) While these high-end cards will run any game very nicely at 1080p, they are mighty, mighty overkill for this resolution, starting at‚Äîin theory, anyway‚Äî$499 for cards based on the RTX 3070 and around $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or list prices, and seldom the going rate at the moment; due to silicon shortages and the activities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it's pricing pandemonium out there right now.) But even with higher prices than normal here in 2021, you don't need to spend anything like that for 1080p play...in most cases. Buying Basics: What to Look for in a 1080p Card Most cards that are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming ring up at between $100 and $300 at this writing. Pricier cards will certainly do the job, too. But the further you get above $300, the more into overkill territory you've gone for most games. Here are the key factors in play. How Much Video Memory Is Enough? The amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card graphics memory (or video RAM) that your video card has onboard directly affects the resolution at which you can game smoothly, as well as the detail settings that are possible. The overall power best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the graphics processing unit (commonly called the ""GPU"") on the card dictates how well you can run a specific game at certain settings, too. But think best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the video memory as a freeway that opens up lanes for the GPU to work its magic without getting congested. Without enough video memory, the GPU will be constrained, unable to perform at its maximum potential. The reason: The video card actually crunches all the pixels that go onto the screen while they are in memory. So, the more data that's needed, either for a certain resolution or to display more detail in a game, the more memory is required to handle it efficaciously. That's why high-end video cards tend to have more on-card memory; more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it is needed to manage all the pixels that render games at higher resolutions and at higher detail settings. Generally speaking, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video memory is an adequate minimum, but 4GB is much better. In cards under $300 nowadays, you'll see graphics memory ranging from 1GB up to 8GB. A few best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the key cards for 1080p gaming come in 3GB/6GB and 4GB/8GB variants. Going with a card that has 6GB or 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is fine, but don't expect miracles, as performance generally does not improve by a whole lot in cards at this resolution versus 3GB or 4GB, all else being equal. Leveraging the extra memory only applies in certain games and under certain circumstances. So don't spend the money on any more RAM or GPU power than you need. For 1080p play, opting for a 3GB or 4GB card should suffice, unless you intend to upgrade your monitor to a 1440p or 4K screen in the near future. But if that's the case, you'll want a card that's equipped with a more powerful GPU, too. Which Ports Does My Graphics Card Need? All the standard outputs on today's graphics cards (VGA, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort) support 1080p resolution. In most cases, you'll just need to pick a card that has a port matching what's on your monitor. It's not until you get into resolutions higher than 1080p that it's possible to start exceeding the capabilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card some interfaces, such as VGA and older versions best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. If you're sticking to 1080p, you shouldn't have much cause for concern or confusion, since all cards and most monitors these days have multiple ports. Chances are, you'll be able to just plug in and go; at worst, if you're upgrading from an old system or card, you may need a new cable or an adapter. So keep these things in mind while you're shopping. Both DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 can support 1080p resolution up to a 240Hz refresh rate, so if playing games at a high refresh rate is your main concern (more on that in a moment), make sure you pick up a card and a cable that are appropriate for this aim. However neither HDMI 2.0 nor HDMI 2.1 can support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b and above can handle that job), so make sure if you buy an elite, cutting-edge monitor like the Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you have the right GPU and cable for the job. Bottom view graphics card Also realize, if you're making the move for the first time away from DVI or VGA, that the HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces can carry an audio signal; if your display has built-in speakers (or is an HDTV), that can eliminate some cabling complexity. How Much Should I Spend on My Graphics Card? This is a moving target, but it's safe to say you can expect to drop between $100 and $300 on a 1080p-appropriate video card here in 2021, depending on whether you want to run games at the very highest settings, or closer to medium ones. If you're interested in enabling anti-aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged lines from the edges best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in-game objects, you'll need to spend toward the higher end best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the range, especially if you want to crank up the AA settings as high as possible. (AA tends to be demanding.) If you're content with just average detail settings and frame rates, by all means adhere to a strict budget. But if you want maximum detail and AA at 1080p, you'll probably need to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The pricing on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream graphics cards hasn't gone quite as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX and AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards, but you'll still see a premium over list price, in many cases. Should I Get an AMD or an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and Nvidia have strong best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, between $100 and $400, though we give Nvidia an edge for hitting more price points within the range with solid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so long as you're sticking to both companies' latest-gen cards, it's hard to pick a bad one for 1080p in that price span. On the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front, we also give Nvidia the win, but it's a near-run thing nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware is slick, lets you record in-game video easily with its Shadowplay feature, and updates your drivers for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install). Nvidia's sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware also helps you join co-op games quickly and easily. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware boasts similar capabilities, and the company's driver sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware is a clear improvement over the Catalyst app from days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There's no longer as much daylight between Team Green (Nvidia) and Team Red (AMD) on this score as in previous years. Also worth considering: the competing image-smoothing technologies, FreeSync (AMD) and G-Sync (Nvidia). If you have a new monitor that supports one or the other, that would be a vital reason to choose one chip company over the another. That said, you can currently find a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors that are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia now supports under its G-Sync image-smoothing tech; these displays are dubbed ""G-Sync Compatible."" Then there's sharpening tech. This addition to gamers' arsenals is the perfect way to pinch every bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you can out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a card. What they do, in a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby increasing performance by up to 30 percent on the same card), without sacrificing visual fidelity in the process. Currently, the two competing technologies from Nvidia and AMD are called Freestyle and Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Gaming hardware inside 2020 is very potent and will provide over four GB video clip mind.

Indeed, they're crucial, along with best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card course, they're the final long term - once they obtain less expensive, a lot less expensive. For that direct long term, although, actively playing at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or maybe ""full HD"") will continue to be the sweet-tasting area for nearly all PC game enthusiasts. Nowadays, 1080p monitors are inexpensive - you are able to discover a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card' em down about hundred dolars - as well as a midrange video clip flash memory card is able to operate the newest video games on among the displays having a silky smooth frame pace. Actually, based on the most recent Steam Hardware Survey benefits, 1080p stays undoubtedly the most typical indigenous screen resolution for PC game enthusiasts along the program, outranking any other resolutions together. The fact is, although nearly all game enthusiasts will really like playing within the greatest resolution achievable, purchasing equally a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or maybe 1440p screen as well as a video flash memory card that will ace gaming at which greater resolution will set you back plenty. (One is determined by the other.) Most people only desire the video games best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours to look great & operate easily, along with that is less costly to attain within the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This particular resolution continues to be the de facto standard format for gaming for a few moment today, as well as it is going to stay in that way before inexpensive 1440p monitors turn out to be a lot more prevalent, or maybe 4K capable visuals cards come to be sensibly affordable. (At this particular posting, gaming at 4K resolution with directing PC titles was not possible to attain with a flash memory card being significantly under $400, except if you are ready to dial back again along the information settings.) So buying a video recording flash memory card which can operate video games with a sleek clip at 1080p is a good purchase, one which ought to keep you pleased for no less than a couple best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yrs, or even longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive by nature Field Only one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a favorite resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards are fighting for that high area within the class. The area best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p visuals cards tends to be more granular as 2021 opens as compared to what it has been, with almost a dozen various flash memory card courses (defined by their various primary visuals processors) to select from. But that is exactly where we are available in. We will take you step the functions you have to give consideration to when looking for a 1080p ideal video clip flash memory card, as well as outline probably the very best cards we have subjected to testing for gaming only at that resolution, provided with the spending budget best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. The best part? Nvidia's launch best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing"" generation video clip cards in 2018 as well as 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" brand best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has intended much better 1080p strength compared to actually for less than $300. Nvidia too, for mid-to-late 2018, launched the 1st cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its inside its brand new GeForce RTX type, which includes the GeForce RTX 2080 as well as GeForce RTX 2070, plus a costly, elite class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most these were augmented as well as, in some instances, supplanted by new, mid 2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, plus the newest RTX thirty Series cards such as the RTX 3080 and also RTX 3070.) While these top cards will go some game quite well from 1080p, they're mighty, mighty overkill for this particular resolution, beginning at - for concept, anyhow - $499 for cards in line with the RTX 3070 and also approximately $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or maybe record costs, along with hardly ever the living price on the moment; because best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tasks and silicon shortages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it is rates pandemonium available appropriate now.) But despite having increased charges than regular right here inside 2021, you do not have to invest something that way for 1080p play...in the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card instances. Purchasing Basics: What you should Search for in a 1080p Card Most cards which are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming band in place during somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 in this particular penning. Pricier cards will definitely get the job done, as well. However the additional you receive above $300, the greater in overkill territory you have absent for many activities. Listed here are the primary key aspects in deep play. Just how much Video Memory Is sufficient? The quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card visuals mind (or maybe video clip RAM) which the video flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has onboard exclusively impacts the resolution during that you are able to game effortlessly, and the information options which are attainable. The general energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the visuals processing device (commonly named the ""GPU"") over the flash memory card decides exactly how healthy you are able to operate a certain game during specific ways, also. But think about the video clip mind as an interstate which opens lanes for the GPU to your workplace the secret best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its without becoming congested. With no sufficient video clip mind, the GPU will probably be constrained, not able to do at the optimum opportunity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its. The reason: The video clip flash memory card basically crunches all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels which go upon the display while they're within mind. Thus, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card information that is required, both for a particular resolution or even in order to show much more information inside a game, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mind is necessary to deal with it efficaciously. That is the reason why top videos cards generally have much more on card memory; much more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it's necessary to handle all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels which make video games from greater resolutions as well as at increased information configurations. Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the time, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording mind is a sufficient bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. Inside cards below $300 today, you will notice pictures mind which range from 1GB as big as 8GB. Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the crucial cards for 1080p gaming are available in 3GB/6GB as well as 4GB/8GB versions. Continuing withusing a flash memory card that's 6GB or maybe 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is okay, but do not count on wonders, as overall performance typically doesn't enhance by a good deal best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards in this particular resolution as opposed to 4GB or 3GB, everything else remaining the same. Using the excess remembering just is true within activities that are certain as well as beneath particular instances. And so do not invest the cash on much more GPU or RAM strength as compared to what you will need. For 1080p play, choosing 4GB flash memory card or a 3GB ought to be adequate, except if you plan to update the computer monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours to a 1440p or maybe 4K display within the future. But when that is the situation, you will desire a flash memory card that is designed with an impressive GPU, as well. What Ports Does The Graphics Card Need best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? Many best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the common outputs on present day visuals cards (VGA, HDMI, DVI, and also DisplayPort) help 1080p resolution. Inside the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card instances, you will merely have to decide on a flash memory card which has a port corresponding what is on the computer monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. it is not before you receive interested in resolutions above 1080p It is feasible to begin exceeding the abilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card certain interfaces, for example more mature types and VGA best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. In case you are following 1080p, you should not have a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card purpose for misunderstandings or problem, after all the cards and many monitors the times have numerous ports. Odds are, you will have the ability to simply turn on as well as go; at toughest, in case you are updating out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a well used flash memory card or telephone system, you might need to have a brand new cable or maybe an adapter. Thus hold the items in view while you are going shopping. Each DisplayPort 1.4 as well as HDMI 2.0 may help support 1080p resolution further up to a 240Hz refresh fee, therefore when taking part in video games with an impressive refresh pace will be your primary problem (more on which inside a moment), ensure you buy a cable and a flash memory card which are suitable for this particular goal. However neither HDMI 2.0 neither HDMI 2.1 may help support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b as well as previously mentioned works with the task), as get certain in case a best is bought by you, cutting edge computer monitor such as Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you've the proper GPU and also cable for the project. Bottom part perspective visuals flash memory card Also recognize, in case you are generating the action initially from VGA or DVI, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces are able to bring a sound signal; in case the screen best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has pre-made speakers (or perhaps is an HDTV), that could get rid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a few cabling intricacy. Just how much Can I Pay for The Graphics Card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? This's a moving goal, though it is safe and sound to mention you are able to look to lower somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 during a 1080p appropriate video clip flash memory card right here inside 2021, based on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you wish to jog video games in the really top configurations, and nearer to moderate heels. in case you are keen on allowing anti aliasing (AA), that smooths jagged collections coming from the tips best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you will have to invest to the bigger conclusion on the stove, particularly if you wish to crank upwards the AA options as large as possible. (AA happens to be demanding.) If you are articles with only typical information options as well as frame fees, by almost all signifies comply with a tight spending budget. But in case you'd like optimum information as well as AA at 1080p, you will most likely have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The rates on mainstream, 1080p capable mainstream visuals cards has not eliminated as bananas as it's for the higher end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 sequence cards, though you will nonetheless view a high quality over record selling price, within circumstances that are most . Can I Get an AMD or perhaps an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have powerful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $400, although we provide Nvidia an advantage for striking additional cost areas inside the number with good best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so very long as you are following each companies' latest gen cards, it is difficult to choose a defective body for 1080p within that particular price tag span. Along the supporting sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front side, we additionally create Nvidia the earn, though it is a near run point these days. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program is slick, enables you to capture in game video recording very easily with the Shadowplay function best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its, as well as revisions the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they are prepared to install). Nvidia's sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program additionally assists you to sign up co op video games easily and quickly. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware features very similar features, and also the business's car owner program is an obvious enhancement above the Catalyst app from days or weeks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There is not the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daytime in between Team Greenish (Nvidia) as well as Team Reddish (AMD) with this rating as inside prior seasons. Additionally well worth considering: the fighting image smoothing solutions, FreeSync (AMD G Sync as well as) (Nvidia). If perhaps you've an interesting computer monitor which supports just one or perhaps another, which could be an important motive to pick out a single chip business above the someone else. which stated, you are able to presently discover a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but that Nvidia today supports beneath the G-Sync best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its image smoothing tech; the displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is honing tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best method to pinch each little bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card efficiency you are able to from a flash memory card. Whatever they do, inside a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby improving overall performance by as much as thirty % on exactly the same card), without passing up on visible fidelity within the meditation process. At present, the 2 fighting solutions coming from Nvidia along with AMD belong in the Freestyle as well as Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, along with every has the own advantages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its & disadvantages. Lastly, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only element, the frame rate prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits (averaging anyplace in between five % as well as forty % within several cases) might appear tempting to anybody attempting to buy the best through best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs in deep 1080p gaming. Nevertheless, DLSS is usually enhanced as well as tuned along the motor aspect for 1440p or maybe 4K resolutions, since all those position by far the most to get as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tech. Gaming systems made in 1080p do visit an increase, without a doubt concerning that here, however the prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits tend to be less apparent wearing 1080p and sometimes do not do adequate to rationalize the gap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cost between a ""GTX"" branded flash memory card as well as a ""RTX"" branded card. (The RTXs will be the merely types which include the essential Tensor cores making all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the secret happen.) If you are a 1080p game player, we would suggest moving by using a more costly GTX design instead best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card having to pay additional for a lower end RTX type within the hopes which Nvidia provides DLSS assistance for all the video games you wish playing a place lowered by the series. We will enter the latest gen AMD as well as Nvidia cards targeted toward 1080p below as well as bust away the flash memory card courses in deep play right now by cost. Can I Get an Overclocked Card, or maybe a Reference Card? Within the realm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a visuals chip (AMD or maybe Nvidia) designs a GPU and (usually) a sufficient cool mechanism best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card. This's viewed as being a ""reference design,"" the baseline type on the flash memory card with absolutely nothing excessively snazzy added, operating during secure rates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card speed. After the chip developer models this particular standard package deal, it hands from the layout to the associates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, MSI, or maybe Sapphire) to make use best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card as being a ""reference"" or maybe ""stock"" design and style for the own list cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Usually, the businesses are going to best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards depending on this particular standard style, but additionally crank away more expensive, higher performance designs which are overclocked. The guide layout typically is going to have AMD or maybe Nvidia branding someplace along the flash memory card, as well as appear reserved in contrast to the more aggressive styles with the older followers, unusual shrouds, as well as the maker's personal branding a lot more visible compared to Nvidia's or perhaps AMD's. With the second cards, the bigger, more complicated cooling hardware over the rii may let them work less hot, as well, giving much more headroom for overclocking, that may create a little increase in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the cards are overclocked appropriate from the box.) As remarkable as these tricked out cards could be, they are able to be louder compared to inventory designs, as well as listed greater. If you actually love the specific appearance best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a certain unit (to showcase, point out, inside a windowed PC case), or maybe you understand out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card an evaluation that you are especially remarkable, we would recommend doing a bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card going shopping investigation. More best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten than not, the money best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours is a bit better expended stepping as much as a flash memory card having a higher end GPU, still in case it is an inventory layout, instead best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a likewise listed, snazzier looking overclocked flash memory card based on a lower end (or maybe previous generation) visuals chip. What's My Monitor's Refresh Rate, as well as Why Will it Matter? Remember that many best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the 1080p card recommendation best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours is dependant about the presumption that you will be consuming a regular computer monitor having a refresh price best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 60Hz. Should you entail using (or even before long upgrade to) a screen board having a greater refresh speed, like among the deluxe 120Hz, 144Hz, 240Hz, or perhaps 360Hz sections today along the computer monitor sector, you will probably have to have a higher end flash memory card than the to obtain the total advantage best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these displays.

In the event you regular gaming plus hardware web sites, you will meet plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card talk around ""4K gaming"" on modern high-end monitors, as well as the rise best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card more-affordable 1440p (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) displays. Spend much time sufficient in the elements, and also you might assume that high res gaming and also costly, monster clip cards rule the PC-gaming world. Not! Yes, they're essential, in addition to best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card course, they're the final future - after they end up getting more affordable, much more affordable. For any direct future, though, enjoying at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or maybe ""full HD"") will always be the sweetly flavored position for nearly all PC game enthusiasts. These days, 1080p monitors are inexpensive - you can discover a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card' em down about $100 - and even a midrange video flash memory card can run the hottest games on one best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these displays having a silky smooth frame rate. In reality, according to the latest Steam Hardware Survey benefits, 1080p remains by far the most frequent native display resolution for PC avid gamers along the company, outranking all other resolutions combined. The truth is, nevertheless, most game enthusiasts would love playing within the greatest resolution possible, selecting equally a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or maybe 1440p display in addition to a video card that can ace gaming at that greater resolution will set you back plenty. (One is determined by the other.) Most people just wish our video games to stand out and run effortlessly, in addition to that's much less expensive to achieve within the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This resolution continues to be the de facto standard for gaming for some point in time now, and also it is going to stay that way before cheap 1440p monitors get a great deal more prevalent, or maybe 4K capable visuals cards end up reasonably affordable. (At this specific article writing, gaming at 4K resolution with guiding PC titles was impossible to attain with a flash memory card costing considerably under $400, unless you are prepared to dial again on the guidance settings.) So buying a video recording card which can run video games with a smooth clip at 1080p is a solid investment, one which need to keep you happy for no less than two yrs, or perhaps even longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive Field Just one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a favorite resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card clip cards are competing for any top spot within the category. The subject best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p images cards tends to be more granular as 2021 opens than it's been, with nearly a dozen different card lessons (defined by their various primary visuals processors) to pick from. But that's precisely where we come in. We will take you step the functions you have to give consideration to when looking for a 1080p ideal video footage flash card, and also outline likely the greatest cards we've subjected to testing for gaming at this resolution, provided with your budget. The nice thing? Nvidia's release best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing"" generation clip cards back in 2018 and 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" brand best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has designed improved 1080p strength as opposed to actually for just $300. Nvidia as well, for mid-to-late 2018, introduced its 1st cards inside its new GeForce RTX type, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and GeForce RTX 2070, plus an expensive, elite class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most these had been augmented and also, sometimes, supplanted by brand new, mid 2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, and also the newest RTX thirty Series cards including the RTX 3080 and also RTX 3070.) While these high-end cards will run some game very easily at 1080p, they are mighty, mighty overkill for this particular resolution, starting at - in concept, anyway - $499 for cards according to the RTX 3070 and roughly $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or perhaps list prices, and seldom the making the decision to live fee at the moment; as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the activities and silicon shortages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it's pricing pandemonium out there correct now.) But even with increased rates than regular here inside 2021, you do not have to spend anything that way for 1080p play...in virtually all instances. Buying Basics: What to Try to find in a 1080p Card Most cards which are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming ring up at somewhere between $100 as well as $300 at this specific penning. Pricier cards will surely get the job done, too. However the additional you get above $300, the better into overkill territory you have gone for the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card games. Listed here are the main key aspects in play. How much Video Memory Is enough? The quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card images mind (or perhaps video clip RAM) that your video flash card has onboard directly affects the resolution at that you can game smoothly, and the information options which are achievable. The overall energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the visuals processing unit (commonly been given the name ""GPU"") over the flash memory card decides exactly how healthy you are able to operate a certain game during some ways, also. But think about the video clip memory as a highway which opens up lanes for the GPU to the best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfice its secret without getting congested. With no plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video mind, the GPU will probably be constrained, not able to undertake at the optimum potential best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its. The reason: The footage flash card essentially crunches all the pixels that go upon the display screen while they are within brain. So, the greater amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card knowledge that's needed, either for a particular resolution or to be able to show much more detail inside a game, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card recollection is necessary to deal with it efficaciously. That is why top videos cards usually have more on card memory; much more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it's needed to handle all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels that render games with increased resolutions and also at excessive guidance configurations. Generally speaking, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording mind is a good bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. Found in cards below $300 today, you'll notice pictures recollection which range from 1GB up to 8GB. A handful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the crucial cards for 1080p gaming are available in 3GB/6GB and also 4GB/8GB variants. Going with a flash card that's 6GB or perhaps 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is ok, but do not count on miracles, as performance normally doesn't develop by a whole lot in cards at this particular resolution as opposed to 3GB or 4GB, all else being the same. Using the excess memory merely applies inside pastimes which are certain and also around specific instances. Thus do not spend the cash on much more GPU or RAM strength as compared to what you need. For 1080p play, choosing 4GB flash memory card or a 3GB should be sufficient, except if you intend to update the monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours to a 1440p or 4K display in the near future. However, if that's the circumstance, you'll would like a flash memory card that's equipped with a more impressive GPU, as well. What Ports Does The Graphics Card Need best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the traditional outputs on modern day visuals cards (VGA, HDMI, DVI, plus DisplayPort) help 1080p resolution. In most cases, you'll only have to decide on a card with a port matching what's on your monitor. it is not and soon you receive interested in resolutions above 1080p It's accomplishable to start exceeding the capabilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card some interfaces, like older versions and VGA best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. In case you are adopting 1080p, you should not have a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cause for worry or misunderstandings, since all the cards and many monitors the times have many ports. Odds are, you will be able to simply plug in and also go; at toughest, in case you're updating out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a well used system or flash memory card, you may have to have a whole new cable or an adapter. Thus maintain the items in view while you are buying things. Each DisplayPort 1.4 as well as HDMI 2.0 can easily help support 1080p resolution up to a 240Hz refresh rate, consequently if participating in video games at an impressive refresh rate will be your main concern (more on which in a moment), make certain you pick up a card and a cable that are best suited for this focus. However neither HDMI 2.0 and neither HDMI 2.1 can easily support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b as well as above can handle the project), that get positive in case you buy an elite, cutting edge computer monitor such as Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you have the correct GPU and cable for things. Bottom part perspective graphics flash card Also recognize, if you are earning the maneuver for the first time away from DVI or VGA, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces are able to bring a sound signal; if the display best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has pre-made speakers (or even is an HDTV), that could eliminate a few cabling complexity. How much money Can I Spend on My Graphics Card? This's a moving target, although it is risk-free to say you can look to drop between hundred dolars as well as $300 on a 1080p appropriate clip card here in 2021, depending on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you desire to jog video games at the really best settings, and even closer to medium heels. in case you are interested in making it possible for anti-aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged collections coming from the borders best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you'll need to invest to the higher end around the cooktop, especially if you wish to crank upwards the AA options as high as possible. (AA is generally demanding.) If you are articles with only regular guidance options as well as frame fees, by pretty much all signifies comply with a tight budget. But in case you are looking for optimum information and also AA at 1080p, you will probably have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The rates on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream images cards has not eliminated as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards, however, you will nonetheless view a high quality over record price, within some scenarios. Should I Get an AMD or even an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have good best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, in between hundred dolars and also $400, nevertheless, we give Nvidia an advantage for punching more selling price areas within the number with firm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But such a long time as you are following both companies' latest-gen cards, it is hard to pick a bad one for 1080p inside that kind best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card price span. Over the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware face, we also create Nvidia the get, however, it is a near-run factor nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program is slick, permits you to capture in-game video recording easily with its Shadowplay feature, as well as revisions the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install). Nvidia's program furthermore helps you sign up co op games easily and quickly. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfers very similar functionality, moreover the company's motorist program is an apparent enhancement across the Catalyst app from days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There's no longer the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daylight between Team Light green (Nvidia) in addition to the Team Cherry red (AMD) with this rating as inside prior seasons. Additionally worth considering: the battling image smoothing products, FreeSync (AMD G-Sync and also) (Nvidia). If perhaps you've an interesting monitor which supports a single or maybe one other, that could be an important rationale to choose one particular chip business above the another. which said, you can presently discover a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia now supports underneath the G-Sync best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its image-smoothing tech; these displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is sharpening tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best way to pinch each and every small bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you are able to out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a card. What they do, within a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby maximizing overall performance by up to 30 percent on the identical card), without sacrificing visible fidelity in the meditation process. At present, the two competing solutions coming from Nvidia and AMD are known as Freestyle along with Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, along with each has the own benefits best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its and downsides. Last, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only feature, the frame-rate prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits (averaging anyplace in between five % as well as forty % in several cases) might appear appealing to anyone trying to get the best out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card their flash memory card in deep 1080p gaming.

This's a moving target, although it is risk-free to say you can look to drop between hundred dolars as well as $300 on a 1080p appropriate clip card here in 2021, depending on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you desire to jog video games at the really best settings, and even closer to medium heels. in case you are interested in making it possible for anti-aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged collections coming from the borders best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you'll need to invest to the higher end around the cooktop, especially if you wish to crank upwards the AA options as high as possible. (AA is generally demanding.) If you are articles with only regular guidance options as well as frame fees, by pretty much all signifies comply with a tight budget. But in case you are looking for optimum information and also AA at 1080p, you will probably have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The rates on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream images cards has not eliminated as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards, however, you will nonetheless view a high quality over record price, within some scenarios. Should I Get an AMD or even an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have good best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, in between hundred dolars and also $400, nevertheless, we give Nvidia an advantage for punching more selling price areas within the number with firm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But such a long time as you are following both companies' latest-gen cards, it is hard to pick a bad one for 1080p inside that kind best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card price span. Over the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware face, we also create Nvidia the get, however, it is a near-run factor nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program is slick, permits you to capture in-game video recording easily with its Shadowplay feature, as well as revisions the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install). Nvidia's program furthermore helps you sign up co op games easily and quickly. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfers very similar functionality, moreover the company's motorist program is an apparent enhancement across the Catalyst app from days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There's no longer the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daylight between Team Light green (Nvidia) in addition to the Team Cherry red (AMD) with this rating as inside prior seasons. Additionally worth considering: the battling image smoothing products, FreeSync (AMD G-Sync and also) (Nvidia). If perhaps you've an interesting monitor which supports a single or maybe one other, that could be an important rationale to choose one particular chip business above the another. which said, you can presently discover a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia now supports underneath the G-Sync best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its image-smoothing tech; these displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is sharpening tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best way to pinch each and every small bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you are able to out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a card. What they do, within a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby maximizing overall performance by up to 30 percent on the identical card), without sacrificing visible fidelity in the meditation process. At present, the two competing solutions coming from Nvidia and AMD are known as Freestyle along with Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, along with each has the own benefits best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its and downsides. Last, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only feature, the frame-rate prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits (averaging anyplace in between five % as well as forty % in several cases) might appear appealing to anyone trying to get the best out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card their flash memory card in deep 1080p gaming. Nonetheless, DLSS is normally improved and tuned over the powerplant aspect for 1440p or maybe 4K resolutions, since all those stand by far the most to gain from the tech. Games rendered in 1080p do go to an increase, without a doubt regarding that in this article, but the prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits are usually far less noticeable in 1080p and best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten do not do adequate to justify the gap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cost between a ""GTX"" branded flash memory card plus an ""RTX""-branded card. (The RTXs will be the merely types which have the essential Tensor cores to make all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the magic happen.) If you're a 1080p game addict, we'd suggest moving by using a more costly GTX design as opposed to paying additional for a lower-end RTX model inside the hopes which Nvidia adds DLSS assistance for the video games you would like playing a place lowered by the line. We will enter the latest gen AMD as well as Nvidia cards targeted toward 1080p below and break up out the card classes in play right now by price. Can I Get an Overclocked Card, or maybe a Reference Card? In the world best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a graphics chip (AMD or maybe Nvidia) designs a GPU , as well as (usually) an adequate cooling mechanism for the flash memory card. This is seen as a ""reference design,"" the baseline type around the flash card with very little too snazzy added, running at safe speeds. After the chip developer designs this regular package, it hands as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card layout to the associates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, MSI, EVGA, Asus, Gigabyte, or Sapphire) to utilize as being a ""reference"" or ""stock"" layout for the own list cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Usually, these businesses will best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards determined by this basic style, but also crank away more expensive, higher performance versions which are overclocked. The reference layout in most cases is going to have AMD or perhaps Nvidia branding someplace along the flash card, and look reserved in comparison with the more aggressive designs with the older followers, exotic shrouds, along with the manufacturer's own branding more pronounced compared to Nvidia's or AMD's. With these latter cards, the bigger, more difficult cooling hardware on the rii may well allow them to run cooler, too, granting a lot more headroom for overclocking, which might spark a tiny increase in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the cards are overclocked suitable out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the box.) As remarkable as these tricked out cards might be, they can be louder than stock versions, and priced higher. If you truly like the actual aesthetics best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a particular model (to flaunt, tell you, within a windowed PC case), or maybe you know from an overview that some may be especially impressive, we'd advise doing some shopping exploration. More best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten than not, the money best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours is substantially better expended stepping up to a flash card with a higher end GPU, even if it is an inventory structure, as opposed to a likewise listed, snazzier-looking overclocked flash memory card based around a lower end (or previous-generation) visuals chip.

Invest much time sufficient inside the elements, and also you may assume that high res gaming as well as pricey, monster video cards rule the PC-gaming environment. Not so! Sure, they're essential, along with yes, they're the eventual long term - after they obtain cheaper, a lot cheaper. For the direct future, even thought, playing at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or ""full HD"") will continue to be the sweet position for nearly all PC avid gamers. Nowadays, 1080p monitors are cheap - you can discover a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card' em down about $100 - as well as a midrange video flash memory card can run the hottest video games on one best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these displays having a silky-smooth frame rate. Actually, according to the latest Steam Hardware Survey benefits, 1080p stays by far the most common indigenous display screen resolution for PC avid gamers over the service, outranking all other resolutions together. The fact is, although nearly all gamers will love playing within the highest resolution achievable, purchasing both a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or maybe 1440p display and a video card that could possibly ace gaming at that greater resolution will set you back plenty. (One relies on the other.) Most people simply desire our video games to look great & operate smoothly, in addition to that's less pricey to achieve within the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This specific resolution has been the de facto standard format for gaming for a few moment now, as well as it is going to stay that way until affordable 1440p monitors become much more usual, or maybe 4K-capable graphics cards come to be reasonably affordable. (At this article writing, gaming at 4K resolution with leading PC titles was impossible to attain with a flash memory card being much less than $400, except if you had been prepared to dial back again along the guidance settings.) So getting a video flash card which can power games at a smooth clip at 1080p is an excellent investment, one that need to keep you pleased for a minimum best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a couple best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card years, if not longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive Field Only one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a popular resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card clip cards are fighting for the high area within the classification. The area best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p images cards is more granular as 2021 opens when compared with what it has been, with practically a dozen different flash memory card courses (defined by their different key images processors) to pick from. But that's where we are available in. We will take you step the features you have to pay attention to when looking for a 1080p-ideal footage flash memory card, and outline certainly the best cards we have evaluated for gaming only at that resolution, given your spending budget. The good news? Nvidia's release best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing"" generation footage cards in 2018 as well as 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" line best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has intended better 1080p strength compared to ever for just $300. Nvidia also, in mid-to-late 2018, introduced its 1st cards inside its brand new GeForce RTX model, including the GeForce RTX 2080 as well as GeForce RTX 2070, as well as an expensive, elite-class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most these were augmented as well as, in some instances, succeeded by newer, mid 2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, as well as the newest RTX thirty Series cards like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070.) While these high-end cards will run some game quite well from 1080p, they are mighty, mighty overkill for this specific resolution, starting at - in theory, anyhow - $499 for cards in line with the RTX 3070 and also roughly $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or perhaps record costs, along with seldom the deciding to go price on the moment; due to the tasks and silicon shortages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it's rates pandemonium available appropriate now.) But even with higher rates than normal here in 2021, you do not have to spend almost anything that way for 1080p play...in virtually all instances. Purchasing Basics: What to Try to find in a 1080p Card Most cards that are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming ring up during somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 in this particular penning. Pricier cards will surely do the job, as well. However the additional you receive above $300, the better in overkill territory you've gone for most games. Here are the key aspects in deep play. Just how much Video Memory Is sufficient? The quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card images mind (or footage RAM) that the video flash card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has onboard directly impacts the resolution at that you can game smoothly, and the information settings which are attainable. The overall energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the images processing unit (commonly called the ""GPU"") along the flash card demands exactly how healthy you can run a certain game during specific ways, too. But think best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the video clip memory as a highway which readies lanes for the GPU to work its secret without getting congested. Without plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card footage mind, the GPU are going to be constrained, not able to carry out at its maximum opportunity. The reason: The video clip flash card basically crunches all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels that go upon the display screen while they're in brain. So, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card information that's needed, possibly for a particular resolution or perhaps in order to show more information over a game, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card recollection is required to deal with it efficaciously. That is exactly why top video cards generally have much more on-card memory; more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it's necessary to handle every one best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels that make video games at higher resolutions as well as at increased information configurations. Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the time, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording mind is a good bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. Inside cards beneath $300 nowadays, you will see pictures recollection ranging from 1GB as big as 8GB. A handful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the key cards for 1080p gaming are available in 3GB/6GB and also 4GB/8GB different versions. a card that's 6GB or perhaps 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is ok, but don't be expecting wonders, as overall performance typically does not increase by a good deal best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards in this resolution compared to 3GB or 4GB, everything else becoming the same. Using the excess remembering only is true inside certain activities as well as beneath certain circumstances. So do not invest the money on much more RAM or GPU power as compared to what you need. For 1080p play, deciding on a 3GB or 4GB flash card ought to be sufficient, except if you intend to update your lcd screen to a 1440p or 4K display within the near future. However, if that's the circumstance, you'll would like a flash card that is built with a more impressive GPU, too. Which Ports Does The Graphics Card Need best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? Many best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the common outputs on present day graphics cards (VGA, DVI, HDMI, plus DisplayPort) assistance 1080p resolution. With a large percentage best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card situations, you'll just need to go with a card which has a port identical what's on your monitor. it is not until you will get into resolutions above 1080p that It's achievable to start exceeding the abilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card certain interfaces, such as more mature versions and VGA best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. If you are sticking to 1080p, you shouldn't have much cause for confusion or problem, since all cards and many monitors these days have many ports. Odds are, you will have the ability to simply plug in and also go; at worst, in case you're updating from a well used system or card, you could need to have a brand new cable or perhaps an adapter. Hence keep these items in mind while you're shopping. Both DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 could support 1080p resolution up to a 240Hz refresh fee, consequently if participating in video games for a high refresh pace is your main concern (more on that inside a moment), make certain you purchase a flash memory card and a cable that are right for this particular aim. However neither HDMI 2.0 and neither HDMI 2.1 can easily help support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b as well as above can handle the project), so make sure in case a most brilliant is bought by you, cutting-edge monitor such as Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you've the correct GPU and also cable for things. Bottom level viewpoint visuals card Also recognize, in case you are making the action as a beginner best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardf DVI or VGA, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces can carry an audio signal; in case your display screen has pre-made speakers (or even is an HDTV), that could eliminate several cabling sophistication. How much Should I Pay for My Graphics Card? This's a moving target, though it's safe to say you are able to look to drop somewhere between hundred dolars and $300 during a 1080p appropriate clip card right here in 2021, depending on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you want to jog games at the really best configurations, or nearer to medium heels. if you're keen on enabling anti aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged collections coming from the borders best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in-game objects, you will have to invest toward the higher end best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the range, especially if you would like to crank upwards the AA options as excessive as possible. (AA tends to be demanding.) If you're articles with only average guidance options as well as frame rates, by all signifies comply with a strict spending budget. But if you are looking for greatest guidance as well as AA at 1080p, you'll probably have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The pricing on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream visuals cards has not eliminated as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 sequence cards, however, you'll still see a premium over include price, in situations that are most . Can I Get an AMD or even an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD plus Nvidia have strong best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, in between $100 and also $400, however, we supply Nvidia an edge for punching additional cost areas within the number with firm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so long as you are sticking to both best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the companies' latest gen cards, it's hard to choose a bad body for 1080p within that particular price tag span. Over the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware face, we additionally create Nvidia the win, although it is a near run point today. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware is slick, lets you capture in-game video recording easily with its Shadowplay feature, as well as updates the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install).

AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware features very similar capabilities, moreover the company's driver application is an obvious improvement over the Catalyst app from days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There is no longer all the daytime in between Team Dark green (Nvidia) and Team Cherry red (AMD) on this rating as in prior years. Additionally well worth considering: the competing image smoothing technologies, FreeSync (AMD ) as well as G Sync (Nvidia). However, if you've a unique lcd screen that supports one or perhaps one other, which could be a crucial reason to choose a single chip company across the another. which stated, you are able to presently get a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia immediately supports beneath its G-Sync image-smoothing tech; the displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is sharpening tech. This specific addition to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best method to pinch every little bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card functioning you can out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a flash memory card. Whatever they do, within a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby increasing performance by as much as 30 percent on exactly the same card), without sacrificing visible fidelity in the meditation process. Currently, the 2 competing solutions from Nvidia along with AMD belong in the Freestyle and Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, and each has a advantages and drawbacks. Finally, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only element, the frame-rate gains (averaging anywhere between five % and forty % inside several cases) might sound enticing to anybody trying to buy the most completely best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card their flash card in 1080p gaming. But, DLSS is usually enhanced and tuned on the engine side for 1440p or perhaps 4K resolutions, since all those position essentially the most to gain as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tech. Games transformed in 1080p do see an increase, without a doubt concerning that in this article, though the prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits tend to be far less visible wearing 1080p and sometimes don't do enough to justify the gap in price between a ""GTX"" branded flash card plus a ""RTX"" branded card. (The RTXs are the only versions which include the essential Tensor cores making all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the miracle happen.) If you're a 1080p game player, we would suggest going by way best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a more costly GTX unit rather than having to pay additional for a lower end RTX type in the hopes that Nvidia adds DLSS assistance for the video games you like playing in a place down the model. We will enter the latest gen AMD along with Nvidia cards geared toward 1080p below and break up away the card courses in play today by cost. Should I Get an Overclocked Card, or a Reference Card? Inside the world best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card clip cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card an images chip (AMD or Nvidia) designs a GPU and (usually) an adequate cooling mechanism best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card. This is seen as a ""reference design,"" the baseline type on the card with absolutely nothing excessively chic added, running during protected rates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card speed. After the chip maker models this kind best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card standard package, it hands from the style to the partners best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, MSI, EVGA, Asus, Gigabyte, or perhaps Sapphire) to use as a ""reference"" or maybe ""stock"" design for the own retail cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Usually, these companies will best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards determined by this particular standard style, but additionally crank away more expensive, higher-performance models which are overclocked. The resource design typically will have AMD or perhaps Nvidia branding someplace over the flash card, and also appear reserved compared with the more aggressive styles with the older supporters, exotic shrouds, and the car maker's personal branding a lot more pronounced than Nvidia's or perhaps AMD's. With the latter cards, the bigger, more difficult cooling hardware on the mini keyboard may well permit them to operate cooler, also, granting much more headroom for overclocking, that can create a small boost in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these cards are overclocked suitable out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the box.) As extraordinary as these tricked-out cards might be, they are able to be louder than stock models, and listed higher. If you actually like the particular appearance best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a particular device (to show best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardf, point out, within a windowed PC case), or you know from a review that some may be especially extraordinary, we'd suggest doing a little buying things exploration. More best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten than not, the money best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours is quite a bit better spent stepping as much as a flash memory card having a higher end GPU, still if it is an inventory structure, rather than an in the same way listed, snazzier-looking overclocked card based upon a lower-end (or maybe previous generation) visuals chip. What is My Monitor's Refresh Rate, and Why Will it Matter? Be aware that all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card our 1080p card recommendation is based about the presumption that you will be consuming a regular computer monitor with a refresh fee best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 60Hz.

Invest much time enough in those parts, and you may assume that high res gaming and also costly, monster footage cards rule the PC-gaming earth. Not! Yes, they're crucial, and best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card course, they are the eventual long term - once they end up getting less expensive, much cheaper. For that direct future, nonetheless,, enjoying at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or maybe ""full HD"") will continue to be the sweet-tasting area for majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card PC game enthusiasts.

Actually, in accordance with the most recent Steam Hardware Survey results, 1080p stays by far the most typical native screen resolution for PC avid gamers along the service, outranking any other resolutions paired. The fact is, nonetheless, nearly all gamers would really like playing within the highest resolution achievable, buying both equally a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or 1440p screen in addition to a video card that could possibly ace gaming at that greater resolution will set you back plenty.

This resolution continues to be the de facto standard for gaming for several moment righ now, and it will stay that way until affordable 1440p monitors become considerably more usual, or maybe 4K capable images cards become reasonably affordable. (At this specific writing, gaming at 4K resolution with leading PC titles was impossible to achieve with a flash card costing much below $400, unless you had been willing to dial back on the information settings.) So buying a video card which can operate video games with a smooth clip at 1080p is a good investment, one which ought to keep you pleased for no less than two years, if not longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive Field Merely one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a hot resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card footage cards are competing for that top position in the class. The area best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p images cards is more granular as 2021 readies as compared to what it's been, with nearly a dozen various flash card courses (defined by their many primary graphics processors) to choose from. But that is where we are available in. We will take you step the functions you have to pay attention to when looking for a 1080p ideal clip card, and also outline certainly the best cards we've subjected to testing for gaming at this resolution, provided with the budget best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these have been augmented and, in some cases, replaced by newer, mid-2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, as well as the newest RTX 30 Series cards like the RTX 3080 and RTX 3070.) While these high-end cards will run any game very nicely at 1080p, they are mighty, mighty overkill for this resolution, starting at‚Äîin theory, anyway‚Äî$499 for cards based on the RTX 3070 and around $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or list prices, and seldom the going rate at the moment; due to silicon shortages and the activities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it's pricing pandemonium out there right now.) But even with higher prices than normal here in 2021, you don't need to spend anything like that for 1080p play...in most cases. Buying Basics: What to Look for in a 1080p Card Most cards that are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming ring up at between $100 and $300 at this writing. Pricier cards will certainly do the job, too. But the further you get above $300, the more into overkill territory you've gone for most games. Here are the key factors in play. How Much Video Memory Is Enough? The amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card graphics memory (or video RAM) that your video card has onboard directly affects the resolution at which you can game smoothly, as well as the detail settings that are possible. The overall power best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the graphics processing unit (commonly called the ""GPU"") on the card dictates how well you can run a specific game at certain settings, too. But think best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the video memory as a freeway that opens up lanes for the GPU to work its magic without getting congested. Without enough video memory, the GPU will be constrained, unable to perform at its maximum potential. The reason: The video card actually crunches all the pixels that go onto the screen while they are in memory. So, the more data that's needed, either for a certain resolution or to display more detail in a game, the more memory is required to handle it efficaciously. That's why high-end video cards tend to have more on-card memory; more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it is needed to manage all the pixels that render games at higher resolutions and at higher detail settings. Generally speaking, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video memory is an adequate minimum, but 4GB is much better. In cards under $300 nowadays, you'll see graphics memory ranging from 1GB up to 8GB. A few best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the key cards for 1080p gaming come in 3GB/6GB and 4GB/8GB variants. Going with a card that has 6GB or 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is fine, but don't expect miracles, as performance generally does not improve by a whole lot in cards at this resolution versus 3GB or 4GB, all else being equal. Leveraging the extra memory only applies in certain games and under certain circumstances. So don't spend the money on any more RAM or GPU power than you need. For 1080p play, opting for a 3GB or 4GB card should suffice, unless you intend to upgrade your monitor to a 1440p or 4K screen in the near future. But if that's the case, you'll want a card that's equipped with a more powerful GPU, too. Which Ports Does My Graphics Card Need? All the standard outputs on today's graphics cards (VGA, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort) support 1080p resolution. In most cases, you'll just need to pick a card that has a port matching what's on your monitor. It's not until you get into resolutions higher than 1080p that it's possible to start exceeding the capabilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card some interfaces, such as VGA and older versions best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. If you're sticking to 1080p, you shouldn't have much cause for concern or confusion, since all cards and most monitors these days have multiple ports. Chances are, you'll be able to just plug in and go; at worst, if you're upgrading from an old system or card, you may need a new cable or an adapter. So keep these things in mind while you're shopping. Both DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 can support 1080p resolution up to a 240Hz refresh rate, so if playing games at a high refresh rate is your main concern (more on that in a moment), make sure you pick up a card and a cable that are appropriate for this aim. However neither HDMI 2.0 nor HDMI 2.1 can support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b and above can handle that job), so make sure if you buy an elite, cutting-edge monitor like the Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you have the right GPU and cable for the job. Bottom view graphics card Also realize, if you're making the move for the first time away from DVI or VGA, that the HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces can carry an audio signal; if your display has built-in speakers (or is an HDTV), that can eliminate some cabling complexity. How Much Should I Spend on My Graphics Card? This is a moving target, but it's safe to say you can expect to drop between $100 and $300 on a 1080p-appropriate video card here in 2021, depending on whether you want to run games at the very highest settings, or closer to medium ones. If you're interested in enabling anti-aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged lines from the edges best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in-game objects, you'll need to spend toward the higher end best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the range, especially if you want to crank up the AA settings as high as possible. (AA tends to be demanding.) If you're content with just average detail settings and frame rates, by all means adhere to a strict budget. But if you want maximum detail and AA at 1080p, you'll probably need to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The pricing on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream graphics cards hasn't gone quite as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX and AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards, but you'll still see a premium over list price, in many cases. Should I Get an AMD or an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and Nvidia have strong best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, between $100 and $400, though we give Nvidia an edge for hitting more price points within the range with solid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so long as you're sticking to both companies' latest-gen cards, it's hard to pick a bad one for 1080p in that price span. On the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front, we also give Nvidia the win, but it's a near-run thing nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware is slick, lets you record in-game video easily with its Shadowplay feature, and updates your drivers for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install).

There's no longer as much daylight between Team Green (Nvidia) and Team Red (AMD) on this score as in previous years. Also worth considering: the competing image-smoothing technologies, FreeSync (AMD) and G-Sync (Nvidia). If you have a new monitor that supports one or the other, that would be a vital reason to choose one chip company over the another. That said, you can currently find a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors that are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia now supports under its G-Sync image-smoothing tech; these displays are dubbed ""G-Sync Compatible."" Then there's sharpening tech. This addition to gamers' arsenals is the perfect way to pinch every bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you can out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a card. What they do, in a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby increasing performance by up to 30 percent on the same card), without sacrificing visual fidelity in the process. Currently, the two competing technologies from Nvidia and AMD are called Freestyle and Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Gaming hardware inside 2020 is very potent and will provide over four GB video clip mind.

Should you regular gaming and also hardware web sites, you will observe plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card talk around ""4K gaming"" on innovative top monitors, and the rise best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card more affordable 1440p (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) displays. Invest much time sufficient inside the components, as well as you may think that high res gaming as well as costly, monster video clip cards rule the PC gaming planet. Not! Indeed, they're crucial, along with best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card course, they're the final long term - once they obtain less expensive, a lot less expensive. For that direct long term, although, actively playing at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or maybe ""full HD"") will continue to be the sweet-tasting area for nearly all PC game enthusiasts. Nowadays, 1080p monitors are inexpensive - you are able to discover a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card' em down about hundred dolars - as well as a midrange video clip flash memory card is able to operate the newest video games on among the displays having a silky smooth frame pace. Actually, based on the most recent Steam Hardware Survey benefits, 1080p stays undoubtedly the most typical indigenous screen resolution for PC game enthusiasts along the program, outranking any other resolutions together. The fact is, although nearly all game enthusiasts will really like playing within the greatest resolution achievable, purchasing equally a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or maybe 1440p screen as well as a video flash memory card that will ace gaming at which greater resolution will set you back plenty. (One is determined by the other.) Most people only desire the video games best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours to look great & operate easily, along with that is less costly to attain within the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This particular resolution continues to be the de facto standard format for gaming for a few moment today, as well as it is going to stay in that way before inexpensive 1440p monitors turn out to be a lot more prevalent, or maybe 4K capable visuals cards come to be sensibly affordable. (At this particular posting, gaming at 4K resolution with directing PC titles was not possible to attain with a flash memory card being significantly under $400, except if you are ready to dial back again along the information settings.) So buying a video recording flash memory card which can operate video games with a sleek clip at 1080p is a good purchase, one which ought to keep you pleased for no less than a couple best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yrs, or even longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive by nature Field Only one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a favorite resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards are fighting for that high area within the class. The area best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p visuals cards tends to be more granular as 2021 opens as compared to what it has been, with almost a dozen various flash memory card courses (defined by their various primary visuals processors) to select from. But that is exactly where we are available in. We will take you step the functions you have to give consideration to when looking for a 1080p ideal video clip flash memory card, as well as outline probably the very best cards we have subjected to testing for gaming only at that resolution, provided with the spending budget best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. The best part? Nvidia's launch best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing"" generation video clip cards in 2018 as well as 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" brand best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has intended much better 1080p strength compared to actually for less than $300. Nvidia too, for mid-to-late 2018, launched the 1st cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its inside its brand new GeForce RTX type, which includes the GeForce RTX 2080 as well as GeForce RTX 2070, plus a costly, elite class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most these were augmented as well as, in some instances, supplanted by new, mid 2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, plus the newest RTX thirty Series cards such as the RTX 3080 and also RTX 3070.) While these top cards will go some game quite well from 1080p, they're mighty, mighty overkill for this particular resolution, beginning at - for concept, anyhow - $499 for cards in line with the RTX 3070 and also approximately $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or maybe record costs, along with hardly ever the living price on the moment; because best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tasks and silicon shortages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it is rates pandemonium available appropriate now.) But despite having increased charges than regular right here inside 2021, you do not have to invest something that way for 1080p play...in the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card instances. Purchasing Basics: What you should Search for in a 1080p Card Most cards which are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming band in place during somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 in this particular penning. Pricier cards will definitely get the job done, as well. However the additional you receive above $300, the greater in overkill territory you have absent for many activities. Listed here are the primary key aspects in deep play. Just how much Video Memory Is sufficient? The quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card visuals mind (or maybe video clip RAM) which the video flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has onboard exclusively impacts the resolution during that you are able to game effortlessly, and the information options which are attainable. The general energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the visuals processing device (commonly named the ""GPU"") over the flash memory card decides exactly how healthy you are able to operate a certain game during specific ways, also. But think about the video clip mind as an interstate which opens lanes for the GPU to your workplace the secret best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its without becoming congested. With no sufficient video clip mind, the GPU will probably be constrained, not able to do at the optimum opportunity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its. The reason: The video clip flash memory card basically crunches all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels which go upon the display while they're within mind. Thus, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card information that is required, both for a particular resolution or even in order to show much more information inside a game, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mind is necessary to deal with it efficaciously. That is the reason why top videos cards generally have much more on card memory; much more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it's necessary to handle all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels which make video games from greater resolutions as well as at increased information configurations. Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the time, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording mind is a sufficient bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. Inside cards below $300 today, you will notice pictures mind which range from 1GB as big as 8GB. Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the crucial cards for 1080p gaming are available in 3GB/6GB as well as 4GB/8GB versions. Continuing withusing a flash memory card that's 6GB or maybe 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is okay, but do not count on wonders, as overall performance typically doesn't enhance by a good deal best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards in this particular resolution as opposed to 4GB or 3GB, everything else remaining the same. Using the excess remembering just is true within activities that are certain as well as beneath particular instances. And so do not invest the cash on much more GPU or RAM strength as compared to what you will need. For 1080p play, choosing 4GB flash memory card or a 3GB ought to be adequate, except if you plan to update the computer monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours to a 1440p or maybe 4K display within the future. But when that is the situation, you will desire a flash memory card that is designed with an impressive GPU, as well. What Ports Does The Graphics Card Need best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? Many best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the common outputs on present day visuals cards (VGA, HDMI, DVI, and also DisplayPort) help 1080p resolution. Inside the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card instances, you will merely have to decide on a flash memory card which has a port corresponding what is on the computer monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours. it is not before you receive interested in resolutions above 1080p It is feasible to begin exceeding the abilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card certain interfaces, for example more mature types and VGA best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. In case you are following 1080p, you should not have a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card purpose for misunderstandings or problem, after all the cards and many monitors the times have numerous ports. Odds are, you will have the ability to simply turn on as well as go; at toughest, in case you are updating out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a well used flash memory card or telephone system, you might need to have a brand new cable or maybe an adapter. Thus hold the items in view while you are going shopping. Each DisplayPort 1.4 as well as HDMI 2.0 may help support 1080p resolution further up to a 240Hz refresh fee, therefore when taking part in video games with an impressive refresh pace will be your primary problem (more on which inside a moment), ensure you buy a cable and a flash memory card which are suitable for this particular goal. However neither HDMI 2.0 neither HDMI 2.1 may help support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b as well as previously mentioned works with the task), as get certain in case a best is bought by you, cutting edge computer monitor such as Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you've the proper GPU and also cable for the project. Bottom part perspective visuals flash memory card Also recognize, in case you are generating the action initially from VGA or DVI, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces are able to bring a sound signal; in case the screen best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has pre-made speakers (or perhaps is an HDTV), that could get rid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a few cabling intricacy. Just how much Can I Pay for The Graphics Card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? This's a moving goal, though it is safe and sound to mention you are able to look to lower somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $300 during a 1080p appropriate video clip flash memory card right here inside 2021, based on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you wish to jog video games in the really top configurations, and nearer to moderate heels. in case you are keen on allowing anti aliasing (AA), that smooths jagged collections coming from the tips best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you will have to invest to the bigger conclusion on the stove, particularly if you wish to crank upwards the AA options as large as possible. (AA happens to be demanding.) If you are articles with only typical information options as well as frame fees, by almost all signifies comply with a tight spending budget. But in case you'd like optimum information as well as AA at 1080p, you will most likely have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The rates on mainstream, 1080p capable mainstream visuals cards has not eliminated as bananas as it's for the higher end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 sequence cards, though you will nonetheless view a high quality over record selling price, within circumstances that are most . Can I Get an AMD or perhaps an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have powerful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, somewhere between hundred dolars as well as $400, although we provide Nvidia an advantage for striking additional cost areas inside the number with good best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so very long as you are following each companies' latest gen cards, it is difficult to choose a defective body for 1080p within that particular price tag span. Along the supporting sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front side, we additionally create Nvidia the earn, though it is a near run point these days. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program is slick, enables you to capture in game video recording very easily with the Shadowplay function best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its, as well as revisions the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they are prepared to install). Nvidia's sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program additionally assists you to sign up co op video games easily and quickly. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware features very similar features, and also the business's car owner program is an obvious enhancement above the Catalyst app from days or weeks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There is not the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daytime in between Team Greenish (Nvidia) as well as Team Reddish (AMD) with this rating as inside prior seasons. Additionally well worth considering: the fighting image smoothing solutions, FreeSync (AMD G Sync as well as) (Nvidia). If perhaps you've an interesting computer monitor which supports just one or perhaps another, which could be an important motive to pick out a single chip business above the someone else. which stated, you are able to presently discover a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but that Nvidia today supports beneath the G-Sync best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its image smoothing tech; the displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is honing tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best method to pinch each little bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card efficiency you are able to from a flash memory card. Whatever they do, inside a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby improving overall performance by as much as thirty % on exactly the same card), without passing up on visible fidelity within the meditation process. At present, the 2 fighting solutions coming from Nvidia along with AMD belong in the Freestyle as well as Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, along with every has the own advantages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its & disadvantages. Lastly, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only element, the frame rate prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits (averaging anyplace in between five % as well as forty % within several cases) might appear tempting to anybody attempting to buy the best through best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs in deep 1080p gaming. Nevertheless, DLSS is usually enhanced as well as tuned along the motor aspect for 1440p or maybe 4K resolutions, since all those position by far the most to get as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the tech. Gaming systems made in 1080p do visit an increase, without a doubt concerning that here, however the prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits tend to be less apparent wearing 1080p and sometimes do not do adequate to rationalize the gap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cost between a ""GTX"" branded flash memory card as well as a ""RTX"" branded card. (The RTXs will be the merely types which include the essential Tensor cores making all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the secret happen.) If you are a 1080p game player, we would suggest moving by using a more costly GTX design instead best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card having to pay additional for a lower end RTX type within the hopes which Nvidia provides DLSS assistance for all the video games you wish playing a place lowered by the series. We will enter the latest gen AMD as well as Nvidia cards targeted toward 1080p below as well as bust away the flash memory card courses in deep play right now by cost. Can I Get an Overclocked Card, or maybe a Reference Card? Within the realm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a visuals chip (AMD or maybe Nvidia) designs a GPU and (usually) a sufficient cool mechanism best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card. This's viewed as being a ""reference design,"" the baseline type on the flash memory card with absolutely nothing excessively snazzy added, operating during secure rates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card speed. After the chip developer models this particular standard package deal, it hands from the layout to the associates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, MSI, or maybe Sapphire) to make use best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card as being a ""reference"" or maybe ""stock"" design and style for the own list cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Usually, the businesses are going to best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards depending on this particular standard style, but additionally crank away more expensive, higher performance designs which are overclocked. The guide layout typically is going to have AMD or maybe Nvidia branding someplace along the flash memory card, as well as appear reserved in contrast to the more aggressive styles with the older followers, unusual shrouds, as well as the maker's personal branding a lot more visible compared to Nvidia's or perhaps AMD's. With the second cards, the bigger, more complicated cooling hardware over the rii may let them work less hot, as well, giving much more headroom for overclocking, that may create a little increase in performance.

After the discharge best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card Titanfall 2, Respawn decided that their following hard work would be a character based Battle Royale game known as Apex Legends. The game came out to small amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card promotion but became a giant success upon introduction. It actually unseated Fornite as probably the most streamed game on Twitch for a while. It is a fantastic Battle Royale game best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfering figures that are unique as well as motivates staff play all over a match. It's very difficult inside terminology best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card hardware but a two GB GPU should be adequate to drive the game. #1 The Witcher three: The Wild Hunt Nearly five decades once the discharge best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its, The Witcher 3 consistently be probably the most famous games in the gaming community. It was heralded as the Game best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the Year in 2015 and is even now considered possibly the best PC video games in the history best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card gaming. The Witcher 3 was an exceptional feat by CD Projekt Red colored as they shipped what is perhaps the most content-rich open-world game best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the precious time. With an outrageous quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card side area quests, this game simply can't be skipped. The game is not overly challenging and a two GB GPU can do just fine to operate the masterpiece. In the event you regular gaming plus hardware web sites, you will meet plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card talk around ""4K gaming"" on modern high-end monitors, as well as the rise best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card more-affordable 1440p (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) displays. Spend much time sufficient in the elements, and also you might assume that high res gaming and also costly, monster clip cards rule the PC-gaming world. Not! Yes, they're essential, in addition to best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card course, they're the final future - after they end up getting more affordable, much more affordable. For any direct future, though, enjoying at 1,920 by 1,080 pixels (a.k.a. 1080p, or maybe ""full HD"") will always be the sweetly flavored position for nearly all PC game enthusiasts. These days, 1080p monitors are inexpensive - you can discover a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card' em down about $100 - and even a midrange video flash memory card can run the hottest games on one best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these displays having a silky smooth frame rate. In reality, according to the latest Steam Hardware Survey benefits, 1080p remains by far the most frequent native display resolution for PC avid gamers along the company, outranking all other resolutions combined. The truth is, nevertheless, most game enthusiasts would love playing within the greatest resolution possible, selecting equally a high res 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) or maybe 1440p display in addition to a video card that can ace gaming at that greater resolution will set you back plenty. (One is determined by the other.) Most people just wish our video games to stand out and run effortlessly, in addition to that's much less expensive to achieve within the mainstream resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1,920 by 1,080. This resolution continues to be the de facto standard for gaming for some point in time now, and also it is going to stay that way before cheap 1440p monitors get a great deal more prevalent, or maybe 4K capable visuals cards end up reasonably affordable. (At this specific article writing, gaming at 4K resolution with guiding PC titles was impossible to attain with a flash memory card costing considerably under $400, unless you are prepared to dial again on the guidance settings.) So buying a video recording card which can run video games with a smooth clip at 1080p is a solid investment, one which need to keep you happy for no less than two yrs, or perhaps even longer. 1080p Gaming Cards: A competitive Field Just one problem: Since 1080p is these kinds best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a favorite resolution, a boatload best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card clip cards are competing for any top spot within the category. The subject best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p images cards tends to be more granular as 2021 opens than it's been, with nearly a dozen different card lessons (defined by their various primary visuals processors) to pick from. But that's precisely where we come in. We will take you step the functions you have to give consideration to when looking for a 1080p ideal video footage flash card, and also outline likely the greatest cards we've subjected to testing for gaming at this resolution, provided with your budget. The nice thing? Nvidia's release best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its ""Turing"" generation clip cards back in 2018 and 2019, alongside AMD's ""Navi"" brand best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards, has designed improved 1080p strength as opposed to actually for just $300. Nvidia as well, for mid-to-late 2018, introduced its 1st cards inside its new GeForce RTX type, including the GeForce RTX 2080 and GeForce RTX 2070, plus an expensive, elite class GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. (Most these had been augmented and also, sometimes, supplanted by brand new, mid 2019 ""RTX Super"" editions, and also the newest RTX thirty Series cards including the RTX 3080 and also RTX 3070.) While these high-end cards will run some game very easily at 1080p, they are mighty, mighty overkill for this particular resolution, starting at - in concept, anyway - $499 for cards according to the RTX 3070 and roughly $700 for the RTX 3080 cards. (Those are MSRPs or perhaps list prices, and seldom the making the decision to live fee at the moment; as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the activities and silicon shortages best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card scalpers, it's pricing pandemonium out there correct now.) But even with increased rates than regular here inside 2021, you do not have to spend anything that way for 1080p play...in virtually all instances. Buying Basics: What to Try to find in a 1080p Card Most cards which are ""good enough"" for 1080p gaming ring up at somewhere between $100 as well as $300 at this specific penning. Pricier cards will surely get the job done, too. However the additional you get above $300, the better into overkill territory you have gone for the majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card games. Listed here are the main key aspects in play. How much Video Memory Is enough? The quantity best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card images mind (or perhaps video clip RAM) that your video flash card has onboard directly affects the resolution at that you can game smoothly, and the information options which are achievable. The overall energy best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the visuals processing unit (commonly been given the name ""GPU"") over the flash memory card decides exactly how healthy you are able to operate a certain game during some ways, also. But think about the video clip memory as a highway which opens up lanes for the GPU to the best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfice its secret without getting congested. With no plenty best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video mind, the GPU will probably be constrained, not able to undertake at the optimum potential best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its. The reason: The footage flash card essentially crunches all the pixels that go upon the display screen while they are within brain. So, the greater amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card knowledge that's needed, either for a particular resolution or to be able to show much more detail inside a game, the greater number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card recollection is necessary to deal with it efficaciously. That is why top videos cards usually have more on card memory; much more best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card it's needed to handle all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the pixels that render games with increased resolutions and also at excessive guidance configurations. Generally speaking, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording mind is a good bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. Found in cards below $300 today, you'll notice pictures recollection which range from 1GB up to 8GB. A handful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the crucial cards for 1080p gaming are available in 3GB/6GB and also 4GB/8GB variants. Going with a flash card that's 6GB or perhaps 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is ok, but do not count on miracles, as performance normally doesn't develop by a whole lot in cards at this particular resolution as opposed to 3GB or 4GB, all else being the same. Using the excess memory merely applies inside pastimes which are certain and also around specific instances. Thus do not spend the cash on much more GPU or RAM strength as compared to what you need. For 1080p play, choosing 4GB flash memory card or a 3GB should be sufficient, except if you intend to update the monitor best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours to a 1440p or 4K display in the near future. However, if that's the circumstance, you'll would like a flash memory card that's equipped with a more impressive GPU, as well. What Ports Does The Graphics Card Need best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the traditional outputs on modern day visuals cards (VGA, HDMI, DVI, plus DisplayPort) help 1080p resolution. In most cases, you'll only have to decide on a card with a port matching what's on your monitor. it is not and soon you receive interested in resolutions above 1080p It's accomplishable to start exceeding the capabilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card some interfaces, like older versions and VGA best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. In case you are adopting 1080p, you should not have a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cause for worry or misunderstandings, since all the cards and many monitors the times have many ports. Odds are, you will be able to simply plug in and also go; at toughest, in case you're updating out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a well used system or flash memory card, you may have to have a whole new cable or an adapter. Thus maintain the items in view while you are buying things. Each DisplayPort 1.4 as well as HDMI 2.0 can easily help support 1080p resolution up to a 240Hz refresh rate, consequently if participating in video games at an impressive refresh rate will be your main concern (more on which in a moment), make certain you pick up a card and a cable that are best suited for this focus. However neither HDMI 2.0 and neither HDMI 2.1 can easily support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b as well as above can handle the project), that get positive in case you buy an elite, cutting edge computer monitor such as Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you have the correct GPU and cable for things. Bottom part perspective graphics flash card Also recognize, if you are earning the maneuver for the first time away from DVI or VGA, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces are able to bring a sound signal; if the display best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has pre-made speakers (or even is an HDTV), that could eliminate a few cabling complexity. How much money Can I Spend on My Graphics Card? This's a moving target, although it is risk-free to say you can look to drop between hundred dolars as well as $300 on a 1080p appropriate clip card here in 2021, depending on regardless best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card whether you desire to jog video games at the really best settings, and even closer to medium heels. in case you are interested in making it possible for anti-aliasing (AA), which smooths jagged collections coming from the borders best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you'll need to invest to the higher end around the cooktop, especially if you wish to crank upwards the AA options as high as possible. (AA is generally demanding.) If you are articles with only regular guidance options as well as frame fees, by pretty much all signifies comply with a tight budget. But in case you are looking for optimum information and also AA at 1080p, you will probably have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The rates on mainstream, 1080p-capable mainstream images cards has not eliminated as bananas as it has for the higher-end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 series cards, however, you will nonetheless view a high quality over record price, within some scenarios. Should I Get an AMD or even an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have good best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, in between hundred dolars and also $400, nevertheless, we give Nvidia an advantage for punching more selling price areas within the number with firm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But such a long time as you are following both companies' latest-gen cards, it is hard to pick a bad one for 1080p inside that kind best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card price span. Over the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware face, we also create Nvidia the get, however, it is a near-run factor nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware program is slick, permits you to capture in-game video recording easily with its Shadowplay feature, as well as revisions the motorists best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours for you (only prompting you when they're ready to install). Nvidia's program furthermore helps you sign up co op games easily and quickly. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfers very similar functionality, moreover the company's motorist program is an apparent enhancement across the Catalyst app from days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There's no longer the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daylight between Team Light green (Nvidia) in addition to the Team Cherry red (AMD) with this rating as inside prior seasons. Additionally worth considering: the battling image smoothing products, FreeSync (AMD G-Sync and also) (Nvidia). If perhaps you've an interesting monitor which supports a single or maybe one other, that could be an important rationale to choose one particular chip business above the another. which said, you can presently discover a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors which are branded as FreeSync, but which Nvidia now supports underneath the G-Sync best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its image-smoothing tech; these displays are dubbed ""G Sync Compatible."" Then there is sharpening tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the best way to pinch each and every small bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you are able to out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a card. What they do, within a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby maximizing overall performance by up to 30 percent on the identical card), without sacrificing visible fidelity in the meditation process. At present, the two competing solutions coming from Nvidia and AMD are known as Freestyle along with Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, along with each has the own benefits best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its and downsides. Last, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only feature, the frame-rate prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits (averaging anyplace in between five % as well as forty % in several cases) might appear appealing to anyone trying to get the best out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card their flash memory card in deep 1080p gaming. Nonetheless, DLSS is normally improved and tuned over the powerplant aspect for 1440p or maybe 4K resolutions, since all those stand by far the most to gain from the tech. Games rendered in 1080p do go to an increase, without a doubt regarding that in this article, but the prbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardits are usually far less noticeable in 1080p and best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten do not do adequate to justify the gap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cost between a ""GTX"" branded flash memory card plus an ""RTX""-branded card. (The RTXs will be the merely types which have the essential Tensor cores to make all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the magic happen.) If you're a 1080p game addict, we'd suggest moving by using a more costly GTX design as opposed to paying additional for a lower-end RTX model inside the hopes which Nvidia adds DLSS assistance for the video games you would like playing a place lowered by the line. We will enter the latest gen AMD as well as Nvidia cards targeted toward 1080p below and break up out the card classes in play right now by price. Can I Get an Overclocked Card, or maybe a Reference Card? In the world best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a graphics chip (AMD or maybe Nvidia) designs a GPU , as well as (usually) an adequate cooling mechanism for the flash memory card. This is seen as a ""reference design,"" the baseline type around the flash card with very little too snazzy added, running at safe speeds. After the chip developer designs this regular package, it hands as a result best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card layout to the associates best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, MSI, EVGA, Asus, Gigabyte, or Sapphire) to utilize as being a ""reference"" or ""stock"" layout for the own list cards best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. Usually, these businesses will best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards determined by this basic style, but also crank away more expensive, higher performance versions which are overclocked. The reference layout in most cases is going to have AMD or perhaps Nvidia branding someplace along the flash card, and look reserved in comparison with the more aggressive designs with the older followers, exotic shrouds, along with the manufacturer's own branding more pronounced compared to Nvidia's or AMD's. With these latter cards, the bigger, more difficult cooling hardware on the rii may well allow them to run cooler, too, granting a lot more headroom for overclocking, which might spark a tiny increase in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the cards are overclocked suitable out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the box.) As remarkable as these tricked out cards might be, they can be louder than stock versions, and priced higher. If you truly like the actual aesthetics best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a particular model (to flaunt, tell you, within a windowed PC case), or maybe you know from an overview that some may be especially impressive, we'd advise doing some shopping exploration. More best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten than not, the money best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours is substantially better expended stepping up to a flash card with a higher end GPU, even if it is an inventory structure, as opposed to a likewise listed, snazzier-looking overclocked flash memory card based around a lower end (or previous-generation) visuals chip. What is My Monitor's Refresh Rate, and also Why Will it Matter? Be aware that almost all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card our 1080p card suggestion is based about the presumption that you'll be consuming a regular lcd screen which has a refresh fee best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 60Hz. Should you mean using (or perhaps before long upgrade to) a display panel with a greater refresh rate, including on the list best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card deluxe 120Hz, 144Hz, 240Hz, or perhaps 360Hz sections today along the lcd screen market, you will probably need a higher end flash card than these to get the complete benefit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card those displays. (See the picks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours for the most effective gaming monitors.) Frame rates higher than sixty frames per next (fps) will display effortlessly on these coverings, and also you will want to consider gaming examination outcomes for a sense best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the sustained frame fees you will probably have with any flash memory card. Although you can discover 4K monitors which can commercially push upward best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a 144Hz refresh speed at 4K resolution, all those displays are similar to a Ferrari versus your regular gamer's Subaru.

Basically, a high-refresh monitor is able to basically show all the frames a next a flash memory card has the ability to put out, up to the monitor's refresh rate maximum, which happens to be a boon for smoothness in situations which are some as well as a huge action in place from the 60Hz maximum best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card conventional monitors. Mega-popular internet video games for example Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card Legends, plus DOTA 2 reward greatly right from a 240Hz, 300Hz, or perhaps 360Hz refresh rate, in addition these games may also be improved to the stage where you could potentially probably address that frame price with an under-1dolar1 300 video card at 1080p. In the same way, GPUs during the $150-to-$300 range is able to push games as Apex Legends, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Rocket League, plus Rainbow Six: Siege into the 144Hz 1080p world without having a problem.

In most cases, for 1080p gaming, 2GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video recording memory is a sufficient bare minimum, but 4GB is a lot better. In cards under $300 today, you will notice pictures recollection ranging from 1GB as big as 8GB. A few best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the key cards for 1080p gaming come in 3GB/6GB and 4GB/8GB different versions. Going with a flash memory card that has 6GB or 8GB best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card RAM is fine, but do not count on miracles, as overall performance commonly does not increase by a whole lot in cards at this resolution as opposed to 3GB or 4GB, all else remaining identical. Leveraging additional remembering merely is true inside certain activities as well as beneath certain circumstances. So don't spend the cash on much more GPU or RAM strength than you will need. For 1080p play, choosing a 3GB or 4GB flash card have to be enough, except if you plan to upgrade the lcd screen best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours to a 1440p or maybe 4K display in the future. But if that is the circumstance, you will would like a card that is designed with a very powerful GPU, as well. Which Ports Does My Graphics Card Need? Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the standard outputs on present day images cards (VGA, HDMI, DVI, and also DisplayPort) support 1080p resolution. Inside most situations, you'll only have to decide on a card which has a port identical what is on your lcd screen. it is not before you will get interested in resolutions higher than 1080p It is accomplishable to begin exceeding the abilities best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card certain interfaces, like VGA and more mature versions best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card HDMI. In case you're adopting 1080p, you should not have a lot best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cause for worry or misunderstandings, since all the cards and many monitors these times have multiple ports. Chances are, you will have the ability to simply power port in and also go; at nastiest, in case you are updating from an old phone system or flash memory card, you might need a whole new cable or maybe an adapter. Hence maintain the items in mind while you are buying things. Each DisplayPort 1.4 in addition to the HDMI 2.0 can easily help support 1080p resolution further up to a 240Hz refresh fee, consequently when playing games at an impressive refresh speed is your primary challenge (more on that in a moment), make certain you pick up a cable and a card which are right for this goal. However neither HDMI 2.0 and neither HDMI 2.1 can easily support 360Hz (only DisplayPort 1.4b and previously mentioned works with the project), as be positive in case you buy an elite, cutting-edge computer monitor like the Asus ROG Swift 360Hz PG259QN that you've the proper GPU and cable for the job. Bottom part view graphics flash card Also recognize, in case you are making the action for the first time from DVI or VGA, that the DisplayPort and HDMI interfaces can carry a sound signal; in case the screen best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yours has pre-made speakers (or even is an HDTV), that could get rid best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card some cabling intricacy. Just how much Can I Pay for The Graphics Card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card mine? This's a moving target, although it's safe to say you can expect to lower in between hundred dolars and $300 on a 1080p appropriate footage flash card here inside 2021, depending on whether or not you wish to jog video games in the really best options, and closer to moderate heels. in case you are keen on making it possible for anti-aliasing (AA), that smooths jagged collections coming from the sides best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card in game items, you will need to spend to the more expensive conclusion best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the range, particularly if you wish to crank upwards the AA settings as large as possible. (AA is generally demanding.) If you are articles with just regular detail settings and also frame prices, by almost all means comply with a tight budget. But if you want maximum detail and AA at 1080p, you will most likely have to venture into the $200-to-$300 zone. The pricing on mainstream, 1080p capable mainstream visuals cards has not gone quite as bananas as it has for the higher end Nvidia GeForce RTX along with AMD Radeon RX 6000 sequence cards, though you'll nonetheless notice a high quality over include selling price, within situations which are many. Should I Get an AMD or an Nvidia Graphics Card? Both AMD and also Nvidia have powerful best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings, as 2021 rolls on, between $100 and also $400, nonetheless, we give Nvidia an advantage for striking additional price points inside the range with firm best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardferings. But so very long as you're adhering to both best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the companies' latest gen cards, it's hard to choose a defective body for 1080p inside that particular price span. On the supporting-sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware front, we additionally give Nvidia the win, though it really is a near-run thing nowadays. Nvidia's GeForce Experience application is slick, permits you to shoot in game video recording effortlessly with the Shadowplay function best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its, along with revisions your individuals for you (only prompting you when they're prepared to install). Nvidia's program also assists you to join co op online games quickly and easily. AMD's Radeon Sbest game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardtware features identical capabilities, and also the business's driver program is an apparent improvement above the Catalyst app from many days best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card yore. There's no longer the maximum amount best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card daytime between Team Light green (Nvidia) and Team Reddish (AMD) with this rating as in prior years. In addition worth considering: the battling image-smoothing products, FreeSync (AMD G Sync as well as) (Nvidia). If perhaps you have an innovative monitor that supports a single or maybe another, that could well be an important reason to pick out one chip company across the another. that said, you can currently get a subset best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card monitors that are branded as FreeSync, but that Nvidia today supports under its G-Sync image smoothing tech; the displays are dubbed ""G-Sync Compatible."" Then there is sharpening tech. This specific add-on to gamers' arsenals is definitely the perfect way to pinch each little bit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card performance you are able to from a flash card. What they do, inside a nutshell, is downscale the resolution best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a game (thereby increasing effectiveness by up to thirty % on exactly the same card), without foregoing visual fidelity within the process. These days, the two competing solutions from Nvidia along with AMD are called Freestyle along with Radeon Image Sharpening (RIS), respectively, and each and every has the own benefits best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its and downsides. Finally, there is DLSS. As a Nvidia only element, the frame-rate benefits (averaging anywhere in between five % as well as forty % in a number best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cases) might appear tempting to anyone attempting to buy the most out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the flash memory card best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs in deep 1080p gaming. But, DLSS is usually optimized and tuned over the engine aspect for 1440p or 4K resolutions, since all those position by far the most to get from the tech. Gaming systems rendered in 1080p do see a boost, without a doubt about that, but the benefits tend to be far less apparent wearing 1080p and in most cases don't do adequate to rationalize the gap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card selling price between a ""GTX"" branded card as well as an ""RTX""-branded card. (The RTXs are definitely the only types which have the necessary Tensor cores making all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the magic happen.) If you're a 1080p game player, we would advise traveling by using a pricier GTX unit rather than having to pay additional for a lower end RTX style inside the hopes that Nvidia adds DLSS assistance for all the video games you like playing somewhere down the series. We'll enter the latest gen AMD and Nvidia cards targeted toward 1080p below as well as break away the card lessons in deep play right now by cost. Should I Get an Overclocked Card, or perhaps a Reference Card? Within the arena best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card video clip cards, the producer best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a visuals chip (AMD or perhaps Nvidia) designs a GPU , as well as (usually) an adequate cool mechanism best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the card. This is known as being a ""reference design,"" the baseline style best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the card with nothing too stylish added, operating at secure speeds. As soon as the chip developer designs this particular regular package deal, it hands best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardf the design to the partners best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card its (say, Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, MSI, or Sapphire) to make use best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card as being a ""reference"" or ""stock"" design for their own list cards. Typically, the businesses will best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards based on this particular basic style, but additionally crank away more expensive, higher performance designs that are overclocked. The reference design in most cases is going to have AMD or perhaps Nvidia branding someplace on the flash card, as well as look reserved in contrast to the more aggressive designs with bigger supporters, unusual shrouds, and the car maker's personal branding even more prominent than Nvidia's or perhaps AMD's. With these second cards, the more substantial, more complicated cooling hardware along the board could permit them to run cooler, as well, giving much more headroom for overclocking, which can create a tiny rise in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these cards are overclocked right out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the box.) As remarkable as these tricked out cards could be, they're able to be louder compared to inventory designs, and also priced higher. Except if you truly like the particular appearance best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a particular device (to show best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardf, tell you, within a windowed PC case), or perhaps you understand from an evaluation that one is particularly remarkable, we'd advise doing a little shopping research. More best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten than not, your money is better spent stepping up to a card along with a higher-end GPU, still in case it's an inventory structure, instead best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card an in the same way priced, snazzier-looking overclocked flash card based around a lower-end (or maybe previous-generation) visuals chip. What's My Monitor's Refresh Rate, and also Why Will it really Matter? Remember that almost all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card our 1080p-card suggestion is dependant around the presumption that you will be consuming the average computer monitor having a refresh fee best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 60Hz. In the event you entail to use (or even eventually upgrade to) a display screen control panel which has a greater refresh speed, such as among the deluxe 120Hz, 144Hz, 240Hz, or perhaps 360Hz sections today over the monitor market, you will likely need to have a higher-end card than these to obtain the entire advantage best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card those displays. (See the picks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours for the most effective gaming monitors.) Frame rates above 60 frames per next (fps) will display readily on these panels, and you will wish to look at gaming evaluation outcomes for an idea best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the sustained frame fees you'll probably have with any given card. Although you are able to find 4K monitors that have the ability to commercially thrust upward best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution, all those displays are related to a Ferrari versus your common gamer's Subaru. For the great majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card players, high-refresh-rate gaming lives worldwide best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 1080p. Whether it has 144Hz, 165Hz, or 240Hz, the 1080p displays within the categorizations are priced about in the assortment best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card $150 to $700, and depending on the game you're actively playing, need a greater or lesser GPU that can match the production best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card theirs. In essence, a high refresh computer monitor is able to actually show all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the frames per second a flash card can spend, up for the monitor's refresh rate cap, which is a boon for smoothness in most cases as well as a major step set up through the 60Hz cap best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card majority best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card conventional monitors. Mega-popular web online games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card Legends, and DOTA 2 advantage greatly out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a 240Hz, 300Hz, or perhaps 360Hz refresh rate, moreover these games may also be optimized to the stage where you could likely deal with that frame fee using an under 1dolar1 300 clip flash memory card at 1080p. In the same way, GPUs during the $150-to-$300 range can push games as Apex Legends, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Rocket League, plus Rainbow Six: Siege directly into the 144Hz 1080p sphere without having a problem. (See our instructions manual on the best videos cards for Apex Legends.) The point would be that in case you're intending on gaming at 1080p competitively, make sure you've gained a flash card rated best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the game(s) you plan to have fun at which refresh speed, given that the very last thing you'd wish to end up with is an expensive monitor which doesn't have an excellent enough GPU to support it right. That is just where looking very carefully at 1080p examination outcomes for a certain videos flash card or course best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card cards tends to make all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the distinction.

Moreover , take a look at the picks best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card ours for the ideal gaming laptops as well as the best gaming desktops, along with our authoritative guide to the very best PC games.) Finally, there's DLSS. As an Nvidia-only feature, the frame-rate gains (averaging anywhere between 5% and 40% in some cases) might seem enticing to anyone trying to get the most out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card their card in 1080p gaming. However, DLSS is best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten optimized and tuned on the engine side for 1440p or 4K resolutions, since those stand the most to gain from the tech. Games rendered in 1080p do see a boost, no doubt about that, but the gains are best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten far less noticeable in 1080p and best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardten don't do enough to justify the gap in price between a ""GTX""-branded card and an ""RTX""-branded card. (The RTXs are the only models that feature the necessary Tensor cores to make all the magic happen.) If you're a 1080p gamer, we'd recommend going with a high-end GTX model rather than paying extra for a lower-end RTX model in the hopes that Nvidia adds DLSS support for the games you like to play somewhere down the line. We'll get into the latest-gen AMD and Nvidia cards geared toward 1080p below and break out the card classes in play today by price. Should I Get an Overclocked Card, or a Reference Card?

This is known as a ""reference design,"" the baseline model best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the card with nothing too fancy added, running at safe speeds. Once the chip maker designs this basic package, it hands best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardf the design to its partners (say, MSI, EVGA, Asus, Gigabyte, or Sapphire) to use as a ""reference"" or ""stock"" design for their own retail cards. Often, these companies will best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardfer cards based on this basic design, but also crank out more-expensive, higher-performance versions that are overclocked. The reference design usually will have AMD or Nvidia branding somewhere on the card, and look reserved compared with the more-aggressive designs with bigger fans, exotic shrouds, and the manufacturer's own branding more prominent than Nvidia's or AMD's. With these latter cards, the larger, more complex cooling hardware on the board might allow them to run cooler, too, granting more headroom for overclocking, which can result in a small boost in performance. (Some best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card these cards are overclocked right out best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the box.) As impressive as these tricked-out cards can be, they can be louder than stock versions, and priced higher. Unless you really like the particular aesthetics best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a given model (to show best game which can run on a 2gb graphic cardf, say, in a windowed PC case), or you know from a review that one is particularly impressive, we'd suggest doing some shopping research. Most best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the time, your money is better spent stepping up to a card with a higher-end GPU, even if it's a stock design, rather than a similarly priced, snazzier-looking overclocked card based around a lower-end (or previous-generation) graphics chip. What Is My Monitor's Refresh Rate, and Why Does It Matter? Note that all best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card our 1080p-card advice is based on the assumption that you'll be using a standard monitor with a refresh rate best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card 60Hz. If you mean to use (or soon upgrade to) a display panel with a higher refresh rate, such as one best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the deluxe 120Hz, 144Hz, 240Hz, or even 360Hz panels now on the monitor market, you'll likely need a higher-end card than these to get the full benefit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card those displays. (See our picks for the best gaming monitors.) Frame rates higher than 60 frames per second (fps) will show up readily on these panels, and you'll want to look at gaming test results for an idea best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card the sustained frame rates you will likely get with any given card. Though you can find 4K monitors that can technically push upward best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card a 144Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution, those displays are analogous to a Ferrari versus your standard gamer's Subaru.

In essence, a high-refresh monitor can actually display all the frames per second a card can put out, up to the monitor's refresh-rate limit, which is a boon for smoothness in many cases and a big step up from the 60Hz limit best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card most conventional monitors. Mega-popular online games such as Counter Strike: Global Offensive, League best game which can run on a 2gb graphic card Legends, and DOTA 2 benefit greatly from a 240Hz, 300Hz, or 360Hz refresh rate, and these games are also optimized to the point where you could likely approach that frame rate with an under-$300 video card at 1080p. Similarly, GPUs in the $150-to-$300 range can push games like Apex Legends, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Rocket League, and Rainbow Six: Siege into the 144Hz 1080p realm without a problem. (See our guide to the best video cards for Apex Legends.) The point is that if you're planning on gaming at 1080p competitively, make sure you've got a card rated for the game(s) you intend to play at that refresh rate, because the last thing you'd want to end up with is a pricey monitor that doesn't have a powerful enough GPU to back it up properly.

Tech Scalpers,How much has changed in China in the last 70 years?,"In 1896, in the Moscow Cathedral, the Tsar was crowned, and the national anthems of each country were played one by one. There was no national anthem for the Qing Empire, so when Li Hongzhang stood up, and he decided to sang an opera tune from his hometown. That year, Li was 74 years old. After bidding farewell to Russia, he went to Europe and America and fell into a dream made up of giant ships, trains, and skyscrapers. The dream is a nightmare. Li, wearing a yellow vest, sitting on the streets of London like a child missed his last shuttle to home. In the nineteenth century, the rush was ending, the tidal wave in the twentieth century was thunderous, the steam behemoth was making a rough respite, but eastern China was like the ashes buried in time. Li Hongzhang has foreseen this point. Thirty years ago, he wrote to the Emporer, saying that the encounter between the East and the West was "" a big challenge that has never happened in the last three thousand years ."" At that time, the East and the West were still separated by the vast sea of ‚Äã‚Äãwrath. Roaring under the sea wave is the convection of technology and culture. The waves roared for more than half a century, and people on both sides of the sea were strangers to each other. In the summer of 1978, The Chinese Central Television (CCTV), which remained the name of Beijing TV, broadcasted the World Cup for the first time. They were not authorized for the broadcast, so they used satellite signals. The narrator Song Shixiong took five people and broadcasted the third place and the final in a room in Hong Kong. The two broadcasts only covered a small number of cities in China. At that time, China‚Äôs home TV ownership rate was only 13.8%. In the countryside of China, you can‚Äôt find a single television. Despite this, people on the other side of the ocean have finally seen a different world. The flying paper on the court, the long hair of the Argentine players, the drums of the exotic and the hospitality from the fans. Later, Yuan Hao, editor-in-chief of the People‚Äôs Daily, read the two games in the courtyard with his neighbors. In the midsummer of Beijing, the players on the TV were wearing thick cotton jackets when they entered the stadium. His father told him that Argentina is in the southern hemisphere, they are in winter there. In the same year, Gaokao was resumed. Yuan Hao was one of the examinees. The final question of the geography test was: What season is the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires, during the summer solstice in Beijing? Yuan Zhen answered this 15-points-question, while most of the examinee could not even read the name of Buenos Aires. In June of that year, in order to introduce foreign capital, Vice Premier Gu Mu led a delegation to inspect five Western European countries. There were more than 20 delegations, and only two have gone abroad. Before the departure, the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially trained them, and the Director reminded: Europe is full of glass doors, mind your heads. In Europe, members of the delegation were extra cautious. They had ice cream for the first time at the hotel. Some people were stranged that the food is cold and asked: can someone heat it up? The greater shock comes from the gap between technology and management. In West Germany, an open-pit coal mine with an annual output of 50 million tons of coal uses only 2,000 workers, while China needs 160,000 workers. At the Charles de Gaulle airport in France, aircraft are taken off every minute, while the Beijing airport, it takes 90 minutes for a plane to be fully landed if they were fast enough. After the delegation returned, they reported in the Great Hall of the People. From 3:30 pm to 11:15 pm, they talked for more than seven hours. The listeners were all stunned. The delegation bluntly stated: We are generally 20 years behind west and we must catch up and change this situation. On December 26 of the same year, on a snowy night, 52 Chinese students studying in the United States set off for the United States to restart the academic exchange which was silent for nearly 30 years. They wore black coats and black leather shoes, with brown handbags, and boarded in order. 52 people, having a total of only 50 dollars, loaded in the leader's pocket. When turning around in Paris, this group of black people was particularly eye-catching in the colorful Charles de Gaulle airport. Outside the huge glass window, they were silently parked in front of the terminal. After the first batch of 52 overseas students returned to China, 17 became academicians. In the second year of their departure, China sent 3,000 international students to the world, and 1,500 of them went to the United States. Soon after, the State Council loosens the policy for studying abroad which allowed students to study abroad at their own expense. The book ""English 900 sentences"" was on fire, CCTV launched ""FOLLOW ME"" (an elementary English learning television program), and Shanghai became a university of English without walls. Radios with English channels were unstoppable. Yu Minhong, the owner of New Orient, recalled that in the 1980s, he lost contact with his classmates all in a sudden. Soon Yu received postcards worldwide discovered that they all went abroad to see the world outside. At the end of 1985, the total number of students studying abroad reached 38,000. Many of them have become China's future technology and business elites. In the basement of Manhattan, New York, once filled with freelancers and artists from China, Chen Kaige, Chen Yifei, Gu Changwei, and others have all lived here. They observe the West, and many Westerners look at China with the same curiosity. American historian John K. Fairbank once lamented: From 1950 to 1971, more people sent to the moon in Washington than in China, although the latter is closer to us, the journey is safer and saves more money. At that time, China‚Äôs flights to and from Europe were only one shift per week. Meanwhile in Beijing, Youyi Hotel, on the edge of the North Third Ring Road, was the only place that‚Äôs open for foreigners. Before 1985, the scope of activities of foreigners in Beijing was limited to the 40-mile range centered on Tiananmen Square, and it was called the ‚Äú40-mile circle‚Äù. Foreigners walk in the circle and are often surrounded by pedestrians. The Chinese never take a break, just silently watching. In the news photos circulating, Western female tourists are playing in the Forbidden City, and the Chinese tourists are watching her in the corridor. In 1985, China opened 244 areas to foreigners, and the 40-mile circle ceased to exist. The primary school students' code is specifically added to one: see foreign friends on the street, not onlookers, no interference, no trailing, warm and generous, not humble. The world on both sides of the sea began to stagger. Samaranch became an old friend of China; the German Schlapner was wearing sparse hair, airing the national football, and the Chinese fans called him Shi Daye. The first batch of German Hummer T-shirts became popular in Beijing. Nike sports shorts have Chinese fans. Playboy bags and crocodile shoes are standard in the times. Chinese children soon became acquainted with ""Tom and Jerry"" In 1994, the Chinese cinema showed Harrison Ford's ""The Fugitive."" There are fans reminiscing, and that day out of the theater, there is a kind of intoxicating dizziness, and suddenly the world is different. In the same year, in preparation for the listing of Windows 95, Bill Gates came to China on vacation. When he gave a speech at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, he found that many young people bought scalper tickets, and they also listened to his speeches and enthusiasm. He is keenly aware of the wave. Four years later, Microsoft China Research Institute was established. On the National Day of 1999, Chinese e-mail addresses began to be printed on Chinese business cards, and young people on the street wore "".com"" T-shirts. The oceans are getting narrower. In the same year, the international investigation agency Gallup issued a report. Among Chinese, 62% have seen foreigners, 72% know the World Cup, 44% know the Chicago Bulls, 39% have heard of Michael Jordan, and 51% want to go abroad. Gallup CEO said: ""The Chinese are actively learning about the world."" In 1999, the Fortune Forum was held for the first time in Shanghai with the theme ‚ÄúChina: 50 years in the future.‚Äù ""Fortune"" editor, summed up the sentence in one sentence. ""To dominate the world, dominate China."" In 1996, Peter Heisler went to the small town of Fuling, near Chongqing, to teach, and took the Chinese name He Wei. There is only one elevator and a nightclub in the small town, and there have been no foreigners for more than 50 years. He Wei wrote in the book the wonderful feelings of people on both sides of the sea: curious, infatuated and fearful. In 2000, when He Wei was the first correspondent to the New Yorker in Beijing, China‚Äôs openness was very different. The number of foreigners entering the country reached 10.16 million. No one is watching the foreign tourists on the street, and English meetings can often be heard in office buildings. A few years later, ""Prison Break"" was on the heat among Chinese people. The worlds on both side of the ocean gradually become one. In 2005, American freelance writer Sarah experimented and tried not to buy any Chinese-made goods within a year. They bid farewell to the $10 Chinese tennis shoes and buy the $60 Italian sneakers; the furniture is broken and cannot be repaired because the replacement parts are from China, and the repair tools are no exception. A year later, Sarah wrote the book as a book about life exhaustion. ""I don't dare to play like this for the next 10 years."" In 2007, Jobs made a sudden demand for the first generation of iPhone screens with glass that was not afraid of keystrokes. It was only a few weeks before the iPhone was in the store. At some midnight on the end of the earth, the new screen was urgently sent to the Chinese factory. The foreman woke up 8,000 workers in the dormitory. After 30 minutes, the new assembly line was started. After 96 hours, the factory could produce the iPhone at a speed of more than 10,000 units per day. Four years later, Obama had dinner with Silicon Valley tycoons in California, and every guest could ask the president a question. When it came to Jobs, Obama asked a question: How can I make an iPhone in the US? Jobs replied: These jobs will not come back. American chips, Korean screens, Japanese sensors... More than 200 parts from suppliers around the world, finally assembled in China, giving iPhone a different scent of both sides of the ocean. The sea is erratic, but people have understood that the story of crossing the sea should not be interrupted. In 2019, Ren Zhengfei said in an interview: In an increasingly high-tech world, it is increasingly impossible for a country or a company to complete one thing in its entirety. In the industrial age, a country can independently make a complete textile machine, a complete train, and a complete ship. The information society and interdependence can promote the faster progress of human society. Ren Zhengfei, age 75, said that only when it is more open can it be more prosperous. When Li Hongzhang visited the UK, he visited the British Submarine Cable Company. The company presented two one-foot long ocean cable lines. The dispatcher sent a 68-word telegram to the Shanghai Steamship Merchants Bureau on the other side of the sea. After 25 minutes, Sheng Xuanhuan came back. The world grips.",https://www.quora.com/How-much-has-changed-in-China-in-the-last-70-years,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,How has the coronavirus affected you?,"I don‚Äôt actually know anyone who is infected with the corona virus. There‚Äôs only been about 122 cases with one death in Canada so far. Mostly, I‚Äôve changed details of my daily habits and routine. I wash my hands more often after touching random objects. I‚Äôm avoiding unnecessary travel or going out to any public places. My friends and I have canceled all planned meet ups and agreed that we shouldn‚Äôt hang out until spring/summer when it hopefully goes away. I haven‚Äôt dined inside a restaurant for over a month now out of caution. I was riding on a crowded subway yesterday and I saw maybe one person with a surgical mask on. Two older women coughed a few times into their gloves sporadically. I think most people seem to realize that they won‚Äôt die if they do catch the corona virus so it doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre taking it that seriously over here but I‚Äôm not taking these precautions for myself. I‚Äôm taking these precautions for the elderly. There was an elderly lady on the subway who looked very, very  terrified  as she sat for the duration of the ride. Her pupils were wide and she was sitting very still cautiously looking around with a really scared look on her face. I realized that for her, every subway ride may be a life and death gamble now. It‚Äôs not pretty economically. The virus may do more damage financially and economically than it will biologically. I see major events being canceled one after the other like a stack of dominoes toppling. Everything from sporting events to conferences. Any sudden unexpected slack in the tight paycheque-to-paycheque reality may be devastating for many people. The stock market has plunged twice in one week already. I haven‚Äôt bothered to look at how much value my stocks have dropped. No point. I‚Äôve sat through The Great Recession so I‚Äôm certainly not selling my stocks just because the market went down. Up until this point for the past several months, I had been furiously preparing tech demos, banner designs, promotional background video and print literature to host a booth with my business partner at a major upcoming real estate trade show in late May where our little startup would be a technology vendor showcasing our product and services. Even before it was declared a pandemic, we had already been discussing the possibility that the attendance turn out might be lower than normal but we just got the email today that the trade show might be canceled for this year if the corona virus situation doesn‚Äôt improve. This is a huge blow to us. My partner had already been constantly complaining for the past two months about how his stock value had gradually been dropping since the beginning of the outbreak. His financial confidence is much lower than it was in December. We really need to win customers and this trade show was one of the best and most cost efficient ways to get exposure for our product and services. Even if the trade show is canceled, the monthly bills don‚Äôt stop coming. I‚Äôve turned down job interviews over the past few months and we just bought thousands of dollars in computer hardware upgrades in preparation to launch real estate tech services. The only thing I couldn‚Äôt have predicted was a corona virus outbreak. The future is uncertain now. Who knew some illegal fishmongers on the other side of the planet could have such a negative major impact on our economy.  3/13/2020: I‚Äôve spoken to a few friends. It seems that people have been hoarding hand sanitizer in Belize, Central America before their country even has their first infection case. All the hand sanitizer in Belize has been bought out and are being resold for as high as USD $150 a bottle by scalpers. This is happening in an already poor country like Belize where their main national highways are now just being paved to meet modern standards  in 2020. I can understand $150 face masks and hand sanitizer but then I‚Äôve also seen a local Kijiji listing where someone was trying to sell two and a half packs of normal toilet paper  for $1100 . I fail to connect the hoarding/panic buying of toilet paper and its relationship to the corona virus. I understand if people bought one or even two packs of toilet paper to self isolate for two weeks but is it really necessary to buy 14 packs or more so just 5% of all the households own all the toilet paper supplies in the city? Panic buying behaviour just contributes towards unethically immoral business practices for scalpers trying to price gouge on people‚Äôs fears. I spoke to another friend who works in the trucking transport industry. He told me there‚Äôs been no change in the supply chain. Production rates are normal and everything is moving as usual. There‚Äôs absolutely no need to become panic-monkeys. While my business partner has been complaining about the drop in his stock value for the past three months, other friends of mine have been messaging me with glee ready to take ‚Äúcheap stocks‚Äù off of other people‚Äôs hands who are panic selling once their favoured stock hits a certain low price. They excitedly say ‚Äúget ready‚Äù as if we were fisherman about to come upon a school of fish. I don‚Äôt know which one is worse: the panic selling/buying fools or the ones trying to benefit from the situation. I don‚Äôt know if the virus will do much biological damage but I‚Äôm already seeing the worst in people. It‚Äôs not the virus that worries me, it‚Äôs other people. A few years ago, I remember a good police officer buddy of mine matter-of-factly telling me from his professional experience and without any humour,  ‚Äúwhat do you think‚Äôs going to happen if something bad ever occurs? People are going to eat each other.‚Äù I laughed it off at the time but these days, my faith in humanity has plummeted.  3/14/2020: It was brought up that people were hoarding because they were worried about truck drivers and other essential personnel falling sick and unable to deliver goods leading to a collapse of the critical supply chain. A steady supply chain is probably the only difference between Venezuela‚Äôs situation and us. We‚Äôre still a while away from that possibility. But if that ever happens, I pledge to personally volunteer to get behind the wheel and drive those trucks myself. I will recruit every veteran I know regardless of their political differences, trades or professions and ask them to put their careers on pause and work together to help drive or learn to drive those trucks. I will ask truck companies to lend us trucks. I will ask oil companies to provide us with diesel. Whatever it takes to keep the food supply, medicine and fuel flowing to keep the country‚Äôs critical supply chain lifeline moving. I will reach out to and lobby every political contact and connection I have to get the municipal government to guarantee protection for their jobs, order for a rent/mortgage waiver or provide financial rent or mortgage assistance and a steady supply of rations for the family of any volunteers who are away from their families if there is such a crisis. I know these people. They were the sword and they will be the shield if need be. A Venezuela style supply chain collapse will not happen while under our watch.  3/15/2020 My girlfriend just called me to tell her that her colleague has a fever today and is going to get tested today for corona virus. They are on the same team at their company and their desks are directly next to each other. Her coworker was sent by their company to the same WE Day event in London where the Prime Minister‚Äôs wife gave a speech and was later diagnosed with COVID-19. Her entire company was told to work from home on Friday but my girlfriend had sat next to her for four days before that after her coworker returned from London. However, her coworker did not exhibit symptoms for at least four days. This is concerning. I spent the night with my girlfriend on Tuesday. Out of precaution, we both have to automatically assume we may be potential carriers of corona virus now and we will self isolate for at least a week to see if we have any symptoms. Fortunately, I already only work from home and haven‚Äôt really gone anywhere in the past week except over to her apartment and I haven‚Äôt seen anyone else besides her for longer than a minute so I‚Äôve had minimal exposure to anyone else. However, my girlfriend‚Äôs friend decided to pressure her to go out for lunch yesterday defiantly declaring,  ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let this virus ruin my social life!‚Äù This is the same friend of hers who thinks it would be a good idea to take advantage of the cheap air fares to fly to Florida and mentioned that it was the only time in her life where her elderly dad actually repeatedly  begged  her not to go. His begging did not convince her. I mean, it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs going to die if she gets infected, right? I suggested that they should be socially responsible and take out their meals and bring it back to her apartment and she had agreed but then instead of going to a local restaurant across the street, they decided to travel right across the city on the subway to eat downtown and didn‚Äôt get home for another eight hours until night time. Since nobody has any natural immunity for this, I‚Äôll have to wait a week to see if any symptoms show up. It seems nobody is really taking this virus seriously as I look outside my window down upon a park and I see plenty of people taking advantage of the nice day there. I‚Äôm also worried about passing this to my mom so I‚Äôve already called to say that I won‚Äôt be able to see her for at least another two weeks even though I haven‚Äôt seen her in a month.  3/16/2020: 407 active cases, 3 deaths today Three additional people from my girlfriend‚Äôs company who were also sent to the same WE Day event in London have now developed fevers today. They were told there are not enough test kits available so only people who have returned from major infection zones or have been in contact with a confirmed carrier are being tested. The only thing they can do is self isolate. My girlfriend‚Äôs friend who earlier declared that  she wouldn‚Äôt let the virus impede her social life  was informed yesterday that she might have potentially been exposed to the corona virus through spending an entire day with my girlfriend this past weekend. However today, she decided to post a message on her whatsapp group chat: ‚ÄúWHO IS COMING TO MY HOUSE FOR A PARTY ON SATURDAY NIGHT?‚Äù ‚Ä¶without mentioning to the group that she might have been exposed to the virus. Does she not realize we‚Äôre in the middle of a type of pandemic that happens once every hundred years? The Prime Minister announced at noon today that the country is now closed to foreigners and the time for Canadians to come home is now. Many public places like museums are closed. I think the government is trying to avert a public panic by gradually rolling out the shut down. I fear these types of sociopathic people who have no empathy or sense of responsibility. There‚Äôs nothing we can do if she decides to hold that party without informing anyone that she‚Äôs potentially a carrier of the virus. I‚Äôve advised my girlfriend to publicly mention on their whatsapp chat group that she might be infected but she ‚Äúvalues‚Äù their friendship too much. My girlfriend said she would try to talk her out of holding the party. I used to wonder why people did not listen to authorities or scientific advice or expert opinion. The rest of us can be as careful and responsible as possible but it only takes one irresponsible person to bring us down with them. She‚Äôs not just betting her own life but she‚Äôs betting the lives of countless others. This lone woman‚Äôs actions could kill dozens of people because of her selfishness. 3/17/2020: 449 active cases, 1 death today Girlfriend and half of her company was laid off today after their recent pay cycle. This wasn‚Äôt a sudden decision. I saw it coming when she told me two weeks ago about her senior leadership complaining that the corona virus had halted their charity‚Äôs usual funding and that they were ‚Äúa million dollars short‚Äù in a meeting. I had asked her one question:  does your position directly impact or affect how much money is brought into your company? If the answer is no, then you‚Äôre probably getting laid off soon. Right up until noon today, she was still convinced that she worked the hardest and was the lowest paid salary staff member (even worked until 8pm last night even though she was working from home) and that her position was too valuable to lay off + she has two masters‚Äô degrees. The fact that her boss‚Äô boss‚Äô boss called her with the news that she was laid off probably meant that her boss was laid off too. Still no symptoms in either of us.  3/18/2020: 627 cases, 1 death My girlfriend‚Äôs friend actually flew off to Florida on her cheap fares today. She knows she‚Äôs a potential carrier of the virus. Unbelievable. I love rebelling against the system too but this is not the time or place for it. I can‚Äôt believe some people can be so selfish. I normally don‚Äôt think draconian measures are necessary but in this exception, the government needs to explicitly lock down the country because there are obviously selfish people who are incapable of consideration for others. Still no symptoms while I self isolate.  3/24/2020: 2091 cases, 24 deaths total Today completes my two weeks of self isolation. No symptoms from myself or my girlfriend who is self isolating separately. I haven‚Äôt seen or met anyone in two weeks. The first thing I‚Äôm going to do tomorrow is go out into the world and buy groceries. Both my girlfriend‚Äôs elderly parents who lives in India fell sick possibly from stress after finding out that my girlfriend was suddenly laid off and was without a source of income. There was also a second round of layoffs at her company two days after she was laid off which gutted their organization to just a bare skeleton crew. Her idiot friend who went to Florida is now stuck there because the Canadian borders are now closed and there are no flights returning. She has another friend who decided that he was returning to India permanently because he feels it‚Äôs safer in India and also due to the economic situation here. However his flight was canceled as India is not letting any planes in or out of their country. Apparently, the city of Mumbai where they‚Äôre both from has shut down the north and south of the city where a sea bridge links the two parts of the city. All Indian state borders are also closed so the migrants cannot even return to their villages. Nobody‚Äôs going anywhere. An old neighbour of my girlfriend who still lives in Mumbai told her on Whatsapp yesterday that her household help maid blatantly said,  ‚Äúit‚Äôs because of rich people like you that this is happening to our country. If rich people like you didn‚Äôt travel, we wouldn‚Äôt have gotten into this economic situation.‚Äú  There‚Äôs definitely some seething anger between the class divide in India. I spoke to various friends all over the world and something similar is happening everywhere. Belize finally got its first case of infection today and I was told by my buddy that it was sudden pandemonium as everyone rushed out to stock up on groceries and supplies before emptying the streets of San Pedro town, Ambergris Caye. He was still pretty confident about the tourism situation for his business right until all tourist cruise ships were suddenly canceled without warning a week and a half ago. My best friend who was supposed to enter the border security agency academy for training in early April has also been told that it‚Äôs being ‚Äúput on hold until further notice‚Äù due to the corona virus. His three year army contract ends at the end of March but the army was gracious enough to extend it for one more month for him even though all troops are being sent home for social distancing reasons. 4/9/2020 Not sure why this answer was removed by Quora moderators but it took them two weeks to restore it. My girlfriend‚Äôs company was completely gutted with a total of five waves of layoffs since her own layoff. I‚Äôve been talking to doctors and nurses and they emphasized the shortage of masks and other personal protective equipment in hospitals. My girlfriend and I both agreed to donate our four personal unused N95 masks to the local hospital so the front line medical staff can use it. I donated them this past week. When I got to the hospital and told the check point staff that I was donating N95 masks, the entire room went silent and everyone turned to look at me. I might as well have given them two solid gold bars. The major real estate trade show in my city has been cancelled. My business partner and I were originally planning to rent a booth to showcase our product there. There‚Äôs really no point in continuing to prepare for the trade show at this point. The only productive thing I can think of contributing usefully is sewing face masks for the public. Last Friday, I told my business partner to put our real estate tech business on hold so I can volunteer to sew cotton face masks full time for free distribution to local shelters and other places that serve the most vulnerable. I‚Äôve ordered a $200 sewing machine from Singer.com and they gave me a coupon code  THANKS10  which can get anyone a 10% discount on any Singer sewing machine from their website. I spent the last three days designing and documenting the blueprint for a very simple mask that I will aim to mass produce in my own apartment in an assembly line process. The design is based on the two examples from the CDC website‚Äôs ‚Äúhow to make your own cloth mask‚Äù page. It‚Äôs two pieces of cloth that accepts a coffee filter in between the cloth. I‚Äôve already spent a total of $400 out of pocket ordering 100% cotton fabrics, a cutting kit and sewing machine. Over the next few days, I plan to setup the website  coffeefiltermasks.com  with request forms to distribute my free masks to anyone who needs them in my community. One thing I realized yesterday from joining community Facebook groups for volunteers sewing masks across Canada is that the production rate and delivery is very low by their own numbers. It‚Äôs pretty much all just a bunch of elderly ladies with their sewing machines in these volunteer groups. I initially ordered two yards of 100% cotton and polyester which costed $14 but the shipping costed $45. These elderly volunteers are living on fixed social security incomes which limit the amount of fabric and material they can afford to pay for out of pocket which contributes to the low rate of production. My test mask model with coffee filter insert and my documented designs:     The elastic comfort component is to hold the mask against the back of the wearer‚Äôs head rather than put pressure and strain on their ears from long hours of usage.",https://www.quora.com/How-has-the-coronavirus-affected-you,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,Which RTX 30 series should I buy?,"Upgrading your PC can be a fun and fulfilling experience, but let‚Äôs be honest, working out which components are best for your build can be tricky ‚Äì especially if you haven‚Äôt upgraded for a while or ever before. When it comes to graphics cards, your choice isn‚Äôt simply between Nvidia and AMD (a very real choice at the moment) but between the many graphics cards available from each. And things get even more complicated because lots of different manufacturers such as ASUS, Gigabyte, Zotac and others all sell multiple versions of each individual GPU model, plus overclocked versions. But that‚Äôs where we come in. Here we‚Äôll outline everything you need to know about Nvidia‚Äôs current graphics card range, and which could be best for your needs. If you‚Äôre looking for information on AMD‚Äôs range, we cover the  AMD RX 6000 Series  separately. What do you need a graphics card for? Before you can decide which Nvidia graphics card is best for you, first establish what you‚Äôre going to use it for. The most obvious thing is of course gaming, but you might want to render video too. If you‚Äôre a keen gamer, the resolution and desired framerate play a big part in deciding which graphics card to go for; if you use a 1080p display and are happy with 60fps, chances are you‚Äôll be satisfied with the new entry-level RTX 3060. If you want to game at 4K or at higher frame rates, however, you‚Äôll probably need to go for one of the more powerful models with more VRAM. It‚Äôs a similar story with video editing; if you‚Äôre looking to edit video, the RTX 3060 or RTX 3060 Ti should suit most people. Both should be powerful enough to allow for multi-stream 4K editing without being overkill.  However, if you need to generate complex graphics or you work in 3D animation, you‚Äôll benefit from one of the faster, more powerful variants of the 30 Series. There‚Äôs also the available space inside your PC to consider; graphics cards are pretty big, and that‚Äôs especially true of the top-end RTX 3090. Whatever model you go for, take a look at the graphics cards dimensions and make sure they‚Äôre compatible with your machine. Similarly, ensure that your PC‚Äôs power supply has the appropriate power connectors and is sufficiently, especially if you‚Äôre running a more basic PC and you‚Äôre looking to upgrade it for the first time. Nvidia recommends a 600W PSU at a minimum for the 3060 Ti and increases to 750W for the 3090, although this will depend on other components on your PC, so it‚Äôs worth taking the time to properly calculate your power demands and what your PSU offers. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 Series Nvidia launched a new range of graphics cards in September 2020, and subsequent 30 Series cards have been appearing sporadically since. The GeForce RTX 30 Series is a significant upgrade on the 20 Series not only in sheer performance but design, cooling capabilities and AI smarts. Generally speaking, the new graphics cards are twice as powerful as their previous-gen counterparts, offering even more bang for your buck and more reason to opt for one of these new cards instead of a 2060, 2070 or 2080. That‚Äôs thanks not only to the improved architecture, but the combination of a second-gen AI core, RTX I/O to boost transfer speeds and remove the bottleneck of decompressing data, and the inclusion of faster GDDR6X memory. GDDR6X offers twice the performance compared to standard GDDR6 RAM, and Nvidia claims that it‚Äôll speed up game load times in titles that take advantage of the upgraded tech. It‚Äôs not clear how much benefit it‚Äôll bring at this point, with no current games specifically taking advantage of the tech, but it could be comparable to the loading times we‚Äôre seeing on next-gen consoles like the  PS5  and  Xbox Series X .  There‚Äôs also a new cooling system in the 30 Series, featuring independent push and pull fans that draw cool air in from the bottom of the case and expel it near the top where most PC outlet fans are found. The fans are controlled independently and result in a 20¬∞C drop in average GPU temperatures compared to the 20 Series, but despite the impressive power, the fans are three times quieter too. The upgraded ‚ÄòAI‚Äô of the RTX 30 Series improves elements like real-time ray tracing, but that‚Äôs not all. Nvidia has used this to create Nvidia Broadcast, software with AI-powered audio and video tools that lets you remove your video background without a green screen, reduce background noise on mic to an inaudible level without a downgrade in quality and much more. It‚Äôs great not only for budding streamers but for those that frequently partake in video meetings and conferences. Now, let‚Äôs drill down into what each 30 Series GPU offers. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060  ¬£299/$319/AUD$529 12GB GDDR6X VRAM Great for 1080p gamers targeting 60fps gameplay 550W PSU required The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is the cheapest current-gen RTX card you can buy right now with an MSRP of just ¬£299/$319/AUD$529, which may seem like a steal considering it has more VRAM than the slightly more expensive 3060 Ti, but not all is as it seems. While there's more VRAM on offer, there are fewer CUDA cores, Tensor cores and RT cores along with a narrower 192-bit memory, which translates to slower performance overall, making the RTX 3060 the ideal option for entry-level 1080p@60fps gamers - those targeting 1440p may struggle. There's also the mining limiter implemented on the 3060 to reduce its efficiency when crypto-mining, which may reduce the appeal for those looking to get into crypto, although a botched Nvidia driver release means there are ways to get around it. The 3060 is the only card to have the limiter right now, but Nvidia is looking to include it in future hardware too. If that has piqued your interest, we outline  where to buy the Nvidia RTX 3060  separately. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti  ¬£369/$399/AUD$688 8GB GDDR6X VRAM Great for 1080p and 1440p gamers targeting 60fps gameplay 600W PSU recommended Next up is the RTX 3060 Ti, which offers quite a jump in performance despite the XX difference between the standard and Ti models. It features the same 8GB of GDDR6X RAM as the RTX 3070 Series, and although it‚Äôs at a slower clock speed than its more expensive sibling, it offers more power than the previous-gen RTX 2080 Super ‚Äì a graphics card that costs double that of the 3060 Ti. It‚Äôs ideal for 1080p and 1440p gaming at a solid 60fps with ray-tracing and high-res textures, and that‚Äôs backed up by benchmarks from our sister site  PCWorld , showcasing the true value of the new entry-level GPU. If you‚Äôre interested, take a look at  where to buy the Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti in the UK . Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070  ¬£469/$499/AUD$809 8GB GDDR6X VRAM Great for 1080p and 1440p gamers targeting 60fps gameplay 650W PSU recommended The RTX 3070 is a step up from the RTX 3060 Ti, offering the same 8GB of GDDR6X VRAM but at a higher clock speed, resulting in better performance. Rather than beating the RTX 2080 Super like the entry-level model, Nvidia claims that it can actually best the previous top-end RTX 2080 Ti, a graphics card that cost over ¬£1000/$1000. That‚Äôs not bad at all considering the RTX 3070 has an MSRP of only ¬£469/$499/AUD$809. The 3070 should be able to provide high frame rates at 1080p and 1440p without breaking a sweat, perfect for those with high refresh rate monitors. It can also run games at 4K, although benchmarks suggest it might not be able to hold a solid 60fps without the help of DLSS 2.0. For more, take a look at  where to buy the Nvidia RTX 3070 in the UK . Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080  ¬£649/$699/AUD$1,139 10GB GDDR6X VRAM Great for 1080p and 1440p gamers targeting 60fps gameplay 750W PSU recommended The RTX 3080 will be the go-to for many, offering great performance for gamers and creative professionals alike, although at ¬£649/$699/AUD$1,139, it‚Äôs certainly not the cheapest tech on the market. The reason for the price? There‚Äôs 10GB of GDDR6X VRAM under the hood as standard, which Nvidia claims is more than enough to power silky smooth 4K gameplay experiences at 60fps with full ray-tracing capabilities, making your games look better and run smoother than they‚Äôve ever looked before. Like the 3070, it‚Äôs much more powerful than the last-gen 2080 Ti, so you‚Äôre getting plenty of bang for your buck with the 3080, but make sure you‚Äôre getting the most out of the hardware ‚Äì if you‚Äôve not got a 4K display, for example, it‚Äôll likely be a little too powerful for your requirements. We cover the  latest Nvidia RTX 3080 news  separately for those interested. Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090  ¬£1,399/$1,499/AUD$2,429 26GB DRR6X VRAM The most powerful GPU available right now, offering 8K@60fps gameplay 750W PSU recommended The RTX 3090 is designed to replace the limited edition Titan in previous-gen graphics card lines, ideal for the most demanding creative professionals. It offers an incredible 26GB of GDDR6X memory to play with, which is more than overkill for even the most dedicated gamer, but it‚Äôll certainly be put to use by video editors and other creatives. Nvidia says it‚Äôll handle 8K@60fps gameplay with ease, but considering there aren‚Äôt many 8K monitors available at the moment, that shouldn‚Äôt be a primary reason to slam down an eye-watering ¬£1,399/$1,499/AUD$2,249 for the GPU. It can handle 4K@120fps though, for those with a high-end monitor 4K 120Hz monitor. It‚Äôs mainly aimed at creative professionals, and the price tag reflects this. What‚Äôs the difference between Nvidia‚Äôs GPU and third-party options? You might‚Äôve noticed that while Nvidia sells its own line of graphics cards, third-party manufacturers like Asus and Gigabyte often release their own branded models of the same GPUs ‚Äì what‚Äôs the difference? The third-party manufacturers all get the GPUs from Nvidia, but in order to differentiate themselves from the standard offering, many will offer something unique. This could be in the form of overclocking, increasing performance of the card, or it could be a better cooling system to keep things running smooth even during demanding graphical work. There are also LED-infused GPUs available from third-party manufacturers perfect for gamers, and some specialise in smaller GPUs for smaller PC cases ‚Äì it all comes down to what you need from your graphics card. Which Nvidia GPU is best for VR? Generally speaking, the RTX 3070 should also be sufficient for playing VR titles using the likes of the Oculus Rift S and Reverb G2 at 90fps, a crucial element to ensure a smooth, immersive virtual experience, although you‚Äôd get a little more futureproofing by opting for the more powerful 3080.  After all, the 3070 may be sufficient for existing games, but as time goes on, games demand more graphical power ‚Äì and that‚Äôs especially true of AAA VR titles that need to power not only a high resolution and frame rate but high-end textures and everything else that goes into powering your virtual experience. Should I buy an older, more powerful GPU? You might be faced with a great deal on an older, higher-tier GPU, and generally speaking, it is better to get a more powerful last-gen GPU than an entry-level current-gen GPU, but with such significant gains from the 30 Series, even the relatively cheap GPUs offer similar or improved performance compared to the most expensive RTX 20 Series cards. If you can get your hands on it, the mid-range RTX 3070 offers better performance than most of the 20 Series collection. The problem is that there‚Äôs huge demand for Nvidia‚Äôs 30 Series GPUs right now, with most cards selling out within seconds of listings going live, so it might be difficult to get your hands on one without paying over the odds from a scalper. It‚Äôs likely that stock will replenish over the coming months, but it‚Äôs tough to say when the cards will be readily available at retailers. You don‚Äôt really have the 20 Series as a backup either ‚Äì PC stockists like Scan and Overclockers UK currently only sell the top-end 2080Ti which, at well over ¬£1000 in the UK, is far too expensive considering it‚Äôs bested by the mid-range 3070. It‚Äôs possible that other retailers will offer the older cards at a discount from time to time, so it‚Äôd be a good idea to check PC stockists from time to time and keep an eye on our roundup of the  best PC deals  too.",https://www.quora.com/Which-RTX-30-series-should-I-buy,,,,,
Chip Shortage,"Besides the automotive industry, does the computer chip shortage also affect the availability of laptop computers? Why or why not?","Yes. They do. In fact the current shortages of PC‚Äôs including laptops are due to this current scenario. The COVID situation has bought out the current crisis which we are experiencing as chip shortages. The overall prices of the laptops and PC‚Äôs has also increased in a wide margin. You can go to the online market and see that most of the laptops under a decent price range has beefed up their current prices. Most models are out of stock. I even tried to order a laptop through online and saw that the delivery time estimates are 8 weeks plus. That is too much time plus than the normal delivery time. The trade companies are telling that eventually this chip shortage will end. But they also cannot predict the actual timeline. i think it will be continuing until the end of 2023. We can expect a normal return of the chip industry. There is also US-China trade war going on the sidelines, which is also a reason for the global chip shortage crisis. ""The reason behind it is the growth of demand outpacing supply capacity and the industry's misjudgment of demand.""",https://www.quora.com/Besides-the-automotive-industry-does-the-computer-chip-shortage-also-affect-the-availability-of-laptop-computers-Why-or-why-not,,,,,
Age of Empires 4,Which video game genre do you suck at and why?,"I love strategy games.  I fell in love with the genre ever since I first played Age of Empires III at the tender age of‚Ä¶ 13? I can‚Äôt even remember. It was a long time ago. Since then I‚Äôve played all kinds of strategy games, like Age of Mythology, Rise of Nations, Rise of Legends, Warcraft 3, Advance Wars Dual Strike, Civilization 3 and 5, Europa Universalis 4, and a few Total Wars. In fact, Civilization V is possibly the individual game I‚Äôve played the most ever (followed by Skyrim). I really, really like strategy games‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a shame that I suck  so bad  at them, though. Ok, to be fair I wasn‚Äôt too awful at some of them, like Rise of Nations/Legends and Civilization 5. But even then, I can only really manage to be good enough to beat the AI at medium difficulty at most. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ I like the strategy part  in theory , but in practice I‚Äôm way too inpatient and impulsive. I constantly overlook things, forget what I was doing, and attack without enough thinking.

Age of Empires 4,What is the best civilization in Age Of Empires II?,"Depends on the map and the game (Random Map or Death match, 1vs1 or team game (TG), and in TGs whether they are pocket (middle position) or flank ). But let's try to simplify: Arabia Tier 1 Aztecs ‚Äì best dark age civ because of free loom, great against Huns; Huns ‚Äì high mobility civ. with their cheap cav. archers and faster producing stables and , no houses); Mayans ‚Äì longer lasting bonus is probably the best economic bonus in the game, their cheap archery ranges come in handy in both feudal and castle age, and their plumed archers one of the best unique units for imperial (cheap and good). Tier 2 Britons ‚Äì good dark age because of fast sheep gathering. Faster producing archery ranges are great throughout the game, and archer additional range is great on their longbowmen and castle age crossbowmen. Their cheap TC‚Äôs allow them a great castle age boom. Celts ‚Äì Faster working lumberjacks are great economic bonus throughout the game, and the faster moving military units makes infantry slightly more viable. Mongols ‚Äì Faster hunting bonuses make this the fastest feudal civ in the game, allowing them to perform very early attacks.

Jeff Bezos,What are some horror stories working under Jeff Bezos?,"It was Feb 28th, 2001. The previous day, I had discovered a serious issue with one of the products my team worked on. We (my boss Rick Dalzell, then Amazon's CIO, Tom K & myself) went to brief Jeff on the issue. This was in the Pac Med building, and Jeff had a small conference room near his office. It was filled by two ""door desks"" placed back-to-back, and lots of tschotskes.

 One interesting one was a tungsten ball, about 4 inches in diameter, on a stand. (Like the one used in the 10,000-year clock.)

Anyway, we are discussing this somewhat important issue and start to feel a slight rumbling. Those of you from Seattle will remember the date -- it was the day we got hit by the Nisqually Earthquake. The rumbling got more pronounced and we realized what was happening. We all dived under the door desks (I was literally ""under Jeff Bezos"" for part of this, which qualifies my answer) while the rumbling got more pronounced. As you can imagine, with me, Rick, Tom and Jeff trying to squeeze under the desk, it was a pretty tight fit. The rumbling got more pronounced and tschokes started flying. The horror came as I heard the tungsten ball start to roll off of the table, heading towards where my leg was exposed -- I was truly scared. To Tom's everlasting credit -- he checked, while under the table, that the site was still up (which is likely why Tom is still employed at Amazon, and I am answering questions on Quora) as I was worrying about having my leg crushed by a metal pendulum! Luckily, no one was hurt, though the building suffered major damage. Unquestionably, this was by far the worst horror in my career working for Jeff.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-horror-stories-working-under-Jeff-Bezos,"Neil, I remember that tungsten ball on Jeff's private conference room desk!  During an idle moment in one of our meetings, Jeff noticed me eyeing it and he teasingly encouraged me to pick it up.  I reached with a fully extended arm, to lift it like a tennis ball, and when I winced and grunted from its substantial weight, Jeff let out his huge laugh: Ha!",Very amusing :),"This is going to turn into a remembrance of that earthquake! I remember looking out the window on the 5th floor with the rest of the design team when we felt the first rumbles. No one moved until the shockwave hit and the crazy shaking really started. I remember all of us thanking our door desks for saving us.  And yeah, that tungsten ball distracted me in many meetings. Glad it didn't hit you, Neil!","I'm sorry...but how is this a ""horror story?""","Uh, thanks! I will NEVER be able to think of Jeff Bezos, earthquakes, tschotskes, balls - especially metal ones, in the same ways as I have in the past. You‚Äôve changed my life (lol)."
Jeff Bezos,What are the characteristics of Jeff Bezos?,"Rather than explain to you the characteristics that allowed Jeff Bezos to have his extraordinary success with Amazon, I'm going to tell you a story.  It is on June 19, 1982 . The evening promises to be exceptional for all the students of Palmetto High School in Miami. Indeed, it is the graduation day. The 680 final year students will receive the precious diplomas that will allow them to go on to college. Among those 680 students, we find the class valedictorian.  He is a bright young man just over 18 years old who has been accepted to Princeton University  where he will study electrical engineering and computer science. As is customary, the valedictorian must pronounce the speech during the graduation ceremony. This is always a great moment in a student‚Äôs life. The speeches given at this time can be inspiring at times, but often they turn out to be rather mundane. The one delivered on June 19, 1982 , by the valedictorian of the graduating class of Palmetto High School in Miami  will forever leave a lasting impression on the audience . Here is an excerpt from that speech: ‚ÄúI want to build space hotels, amusement parks, yachts, and colonies for two or three million people orbiting around the earth. The whole idea is to preserve the earth. My final objective is to get all people off the earth and see it turned into a huge national park.‚Äù I remind you then that we are in June 1982. With a speech like that, the brilliant high school student who is about to leave to study at Princeton University looks like a fancy guy who has read a bit too many science fiction books. Talking about his plans for the future, this high school student must have seen his friends, or his family, making fun of him . Many must have told him that he was out of touch with the world and needed to focus on more realistic goals. Yet our young man continued on his way. After brilliant studies at Princeton University, he graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Arts and Science degree. He went to work at several Wall Street financial firms. His success was immediate. At the beginning of 1994, our young man is already a millionaire and lives comfortably in New York City . For many, it would be tempting to settle for this situation. Not for him. Aware that the rise of the Internet will change the world in the future, he decides to leave everything to launch his startup. The idea, which has obsessed him for some time, is to create an online bookstore with millions of titles. Our young man wants to take advantage of the phenomenal growth of the Web. On July 5, 1994, he founded Amzon in Seattle . Thanks to an incredible vision, Jeff Bezos made Amazon the incredible success it is today with a market cap superior to 1,440 billion dollars. Yet Jeff Bezos never forgot his personal goals. It is the reason why Jeff Bezos founded the space travel company Blue Origin in 2000 . For more than 20 years, Jeff Bezos has invested hundreds of millions of dollars each year in the development of this company, which should enable him to realize his dream of colonizing space. Thus, Amazon‚Äôs success serves to realize his true goal . This goal made his entourage say at the time that Jeff Bezos was a young high school student who had a little too much abuse of science fiction books. With his focus on his goal, Jeff Bezos has never let those around him take his dream away from him. This dream may have seemed crazy to everyone, but Jeff Bezos knew that he should not listen to others, or else he would fail.  Today, no one laughs anymore when Jeff Bezos talks about colonizing space . Everybody thinks he can do it. After 40 years of tireless effort, Jeff Bezos has never been so close to his dream. Nothing is won yet, but Jeff Bezos can be trusted to keep working hard to make it happen. This story should have given you a better understanding of the characteristics that made Jeff Bezos the successful man he is today. Conclusion There are many reasons why Jeff Bezos got to where he is today. He‚Äôs a person of remarkable intelligence.  Jeff Bezos is a born entrepreneur who is never afraid to try new and innovative things . That‚Äôs how he achieves things that many people thought were unimaginable. This answer is based on an article I wrote about Jeff Bezos a few months ago, which you can find in detail here : ‚Äú The Main Reason Why People Fail in Life (and How You Can Avoid This Trap)   ‚Äù.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-characteristics-of-Jeff-Bezos,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,How heavy of a sentence are they giving for a misdemeanor of ten grams of meth with prior convictions over 20 years ago?,"I don‚Äôt think they can put you in jail for drug charges any more. You must do diversion in some cases. Selling drugs is probably stoll tricky but if they were thinking, they‚Äôd simply seize the dealers assets. It‚Äôs obvious cops know where trap houses are and let them operate for reasons you may not expect. Without drugs, founds are more of a problem in some areas. In a lot places, there is no room for the dealers and users. Prisons in CA were ordered to release a large number of inmates because of overcrowding as well as a growing understanding about the war on drugs and how it‚Äôs become a lucrative enterprise for billionaires who have turned schools, military, medical care, prisons, and other public assets into their cash cows.  If your convictions are serious, especially if they are violent. A bust with ten grams may be a 3 strikes offense. These things can abd do all kinds of ways. You may be able to beat the case if your 4 Th amendment rights were violated. Your employment, family obligations, attitude and proactive efforts ( like enrolling in treatment, attending NA and ability to hire a lawyer will factor into the way your case turns out. If you were not on parol or probation and the arrest report contains no disturbing details like you being naked and sexually excited, issuing threats, resisting arrest or carrying a weapon or other suspect items, you will likely have a loose ly supervisec directive to clean up your act. It depends on programs where you live, how full they are and how you are perceived by the court. Ten grans is a lot of meth but still seems like personal stash. If the stuff was in a single container you‚Äôre ok, but if you had it in 10 baggies or birdies, the implication is distribution. You can say the stuff was purchased in those bags and you were stocking up because you planned to have travel or the connection was leaving town for a while. There will be efforts to turn you if you seem like a fruitful snitch. Tell them your dealer meets you near wherever you were popped, give them a burner phone # or a free text thing. Describe the dealer as opposite of your dealer. Give the person a name like LUPE or Larry. That‚Äôs all you know. You insist the person is not a friend and you have no idea where they live. Make this dealer well dressed, well groomed and not like he real deal probably is. If your life is in order‚Ä¶ you have an honest income, a place to live, a car you can legally drive, it‚Äôs not likely they will get too draconian. Again, depends on your area, the judge, funding, prison population and so on. Being a teacher, a cop, a city employee, a public transit driver, or any job where sobriety is crucial, you may end up in trouble because the arrest s automatically reported to schools, CAL trans, police departments, social worker, and so on. Being a merchant marine, longshoreman, iron worker, or any unionized worker s fortuitous because there is usually recovery benefits available. I am not a fan of the rehab industry. In my mind the relapse you will suffer speaks to he greed and limited benefits of becoming a 12 step puppet. That said, I have freinds who are happy and truly believe in the programs. One old pal never went to rehab for her drinking or relapsed. She was a drunk who took one drink and old not stop. This suggests she is allergic to alcohol. In my opinion, drugs should be legal, provided by the system and overseen in clinics where nurse practitioners and counselors are available. Portugal had an awful drug epidemic not so long ago. The country was economically and otherwise devastated by the addiction of so many. An innovatotive new leader was elected and he decriminalized the drugs, distributed them and educated the addicts. There was no judgement. There was no hustle to score the stuff and less chance of ODs with the needle exchanges, regulated dope and .safe practices available. Miraculously 40% of the junkies simply lost interest in using inside of a year or two. Others gradually tapered off and got their habit in hand. Forbidden fruit is a human weakness going back to the first humans a cording to scriptures and thousands of of years with the same old thing. Prohibition made bath tub gi n irresistible ? Nancy Reagan‚Äôs DARE program only intrigues youngsters. It also illustrated how hypocrisy has no shame because the First Lady was a long Time speed freak, who popped diet pills to stay scary skinny according to her own daughter. I don‚Äôt think you deserve to be incarcerated but I suspect you are pretty strung out because you got busted, the cops are generally stupid and many people are using druhs like meth and no one is the wiser, least of all law enforcement. If you‚Äôre dealing, you certainly cannot be cavalier about who you sell to. Teenagers from the HS, moms with small children, conspicuous fiends, criminals, mentally ill folks and many vulnerable people put you at risk in many ways. If these people become casualties or maje others victims while on drugs the get from you, you‚Äôre culpable. It may not become a legal issue but you‚Äôre still guilty. Ten grams may be a cheap wholesale amount you get and share with few pals. That‚Äôs one thing, though you can not tell cops that as it‚Äôs technically sales. If you‚Äôre able to beat the charges, you need to know that these cops now know you. You may decide to move to be under the radar or actually give the drug up, which we should all do to see how life is without it. Meth is an easy detox and is best beat by exercise, some gabapintin ( a nerve drug easily prescribed) and Wellbutrin, an antidepressant that can cause ruined tests to look like like meth +. It too is easy to get, useful in keeping one‚Äôs spirits up and effective in a few doses. It‚Äôs consistent with the kind of medical care courtesy want you to seek out. If you are an addict, you are likely in other trouble and look worse for wear. While propaganda about meth is rampant, it is like any drug. It can exasperate certain personalities and mental health or physical conditions. Weed, coffee, booze and even certain food can make thing worse for some. Weed is not a pleasant high for paranoid schizophrenics. Speed is not a sound recreational drug if someone has a heRt problems, OCD, eating disorders or an inability to control their behavior. Shooting it up can make it far more dangerous as it‚Äôs intensity impairs the impulse control and empathy of some people. Speed was an element in the Axis oof evil, especially for Hitler. Charlie Manson was strung out on it as were Tex Watson and Susan Atkins. These appalling human beings were amplified by amphetamine. The summer of love was not all that happy when pushers began showing teen aged flower children how to shoot up speed, which is why clinics were erected abd guys like Manson were able to make the most of their cons . There was a slogan, Speed Kills back then. It‚Äôs not true. Speed doesn‚Äôt kill. In favor there‚Äôs a lot of dental disasters with bad skin in photos that allegedly prove how speed destroys a use, which the experts say five years after one begins using he or she is going to be dead. As you may know tweakers are resilient and resourceful. There are many senior citizens using meth, and they‚Äôve been doing so for decades. They work, often as truck drivers, waitresses, housekeepers, laborers, bar tenders,, scalpers, dancers and housewives. Doctors, nurses, academics, tech wizards, stock market big shots, police, business owners, porn stars, entrepreneurs, geeks, mechanics, writers, artists, military careerists, lobbyists, athletes, journalists, and others use meth as well as other illicit drugs for more than merely recreation. There is a lot of damage caused by the lifestyle many drug users fall,into because they are under the influence of meth, heirune ir whatever. With meth,,the lack of sleep, good nutrition, water, adequate shelter, an income that is stable and activities like exercise,, socializing beyond the trap house, healthy relationships, medical care, and purpose can lead to s decline in health, joy. Hope and attractiveness. Financiak issues are often a prifound problem for addicts who lose their jobs, their support systems, priorities and potential because they caannot function with or without the drug. People will pic their faces, live in desperate days dirty conditions, eat poorly, ignore medical conditions,, become impulsive thus reckless. This means they may indulge in sexual behaviors that are degrading, dangerous and dangerous. Being repped off, beaten up, raped, jailed, rejected, marginalized and mad as a hatter when spun, up for a week and forced to break laws, sell your things and bbetra others to get your drugs has a devastating impact,on many. Many more use and no one ever knows they do so. Others use and though it it causes conflict for them with family or friends, no one can make a big deal out of a habit when the user is working, has shelter, steers clear of legal troubles, looks nothing like a strawberry zombie and is in decent health. Sure the drugs can cost the user her potential for promotion, keep her from owning a house , maje her wardrobe, car and firniture shabby and compromise the quality of life. Her looks aren‚Äôt likely to improve. Sex fir men can become difficult and women may be insatiable. The drugs and neglect will often impact one‚Äôs mental and emotional functions. The body can become weak, misaligned, undernourished, prone to infections, twitchy, dehydrated, dysfunctional and increasingly harmed by the abuse users inflict on themselves. Speed is much safer in prescriptions but meth these days is notably standardized The cooks in motels, trailers, shacks and RVs are no longer mixing up pot luck that became the scary strong ice in the 80s and 90s. Biker cranks are not invading our bodies with filthy batches of foul brown dope that they called peanut butter back in the day. Smurfs can no longer buy up Sudafed from drug stores to give the meth cooks their key ingredients thanks to laws that were actually effective. Buying meth is still easy and it remains cheap, and Houghton dealers will always stomp on the product with salt, fish chemicals, and so on, the drugs are bo longer so strong you may use a tiny amount and find yourself babbling like a loon or doing a rapid descent into porno excess and sexual behavior that leaves your parts raw, oozing, stinky, insatiable, or limp. Yes, people can find meth and remain somewhat sane. People who use stimulants are typically ADD or ADHD according to doctors practicing in clinics where addicts seek treatment,, resources and insights about their psyches. Drugs are often blames for a personz‚Äôs problems, and it‚Äôs an assumption that makes homelessness, mental health concerns, abuse, social and personal dysfunction and much more seem insignificant when there is an ugly assumption about drug users and drugs,l we need to see drugs as an insidious symptom of a condition that is caused by trauma, low self esteem, peer pressure, acrual circumstances that maje pain killers a godsend for the injured and Valium the way a person survives. Speed helps obeseity, ADHD, Add, depression. In fact, stimulants have long been an impressive creative and intellectual fuel for Sartre, Warhol, Focault, Lou Reed, Cash, Kennedy Bros, Judy Garland, Capote, Churchill,, Fossee, Sedgwick, Freud, Sheen, Evans, Clapton, the Beatles ( who did pep pills long before weed or LSD. Joe Horton, Steven King, Alistar Crowley, Hefner, Basquiat, David Bowie, John Belushi, Sonny Barger, Hunter S. Thompson, Ginger Baker, Mabel Normand, Carrie Fisher, Lester Bangs, the Beats, John Landis, Linda Ronstad, Steve Nicks, Bob Evans,Ann Sexton, Phillip Dick, Roy Raden, Jacqueline Suzanne, Frances Farmer, Lenny Bruce, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, Johnny Rotten, Bob Dylan, Tupac, Jessica Savage, and more were using pep pills and powders to propell them and for a few, it was too much momentum. Scientists, doctors, Researchers, lawyers, nurses, detectives, writers, longshoremen, pilots, stockbrokers, leaders, painters, architects, philosophers, designers, all kinds of people use all kinds of drugs. When you‚Äôre using them and they are part of a creative process., a way to focus, a source of stamina, an asset to your effort ( until they‚Äôre not) there issense in it and perhaps more mindful consumption than the addicts who are concerned with one thing: Geeing and staying high until they are spent. This suggests many addicts have an issues with comsive and obsessive behaviors. They do not see a drug as a tool but as an essential priority that undermines any artistic, professional or social edge the drugs initially offered. Are you loving for your next bump? Do you have a pookie in your pocket wherever you go? Do you panic when your stash is low. Will you sell your guitar or paintbrushes to get more? Will steal, turn trick and lie to pay for the drug which means your life is all cycle of hustling, scoring, using without room for art, work, love and the dreams you had before you formed meth? If you‚Äôre life is headed to catastrophe and possible cage because meth is all you have in it, you must see the legal issues now as an alarm. If you‚Äôre lucky and beat sereious consequences, be wise and quit while you‚Äôre ahead. When I say quit I don‚Äôt necessarily mean the all or nothing dynamic the world lays out. I mean draw some lines in the sand. 798 will, not violate your integrity, trust others give your, your temple or the body, your own self worth or the obligation you have to contribute to our culture by working, being a decent human neigh and realizing whatever it is you‚Äôre here to do.

Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos an inspirational leader?,"Jeff Bezos has managed to build a Web giant from scratch in just 25 years.  That's an extremely inspiring thing in itself. In addition, Jeff Bezos has a special story. From a very young age, his goal has always been to colonize space. During his graduation speech at the High School in 1982, he explained to everyone what his plans were for the future. Without being afraid of the world's criticism, he explained his crazy project. Many people took him for a young high school student who was a bit whimsical. Jeff Bezos was not. Jeff Bezos is someone who knows what he wants. Since that time, he has never let go of the real goal that gives meaning to his life. As soon as he made his fortune with Amazon, he created Blue Origin. He invests hundreds of millions of dollars every year in Blue Origin to make his dream come true. Today, no one thinks he's whimsical anymore. Everyone thinks Jeff Bezos will succeed in colonizing space. Jeff Bezos is an extremely inspirational person. He never lets the limits of society limit his ambitions and dreams.

Tech Scalpers,Why do liberals want to get rid of private insurance?,"Why do liberals want to get rid of private insurance? For the simple reason that the insurers‚Äô priority isn‚Äôt to provide you with health care. It‚Äôs actually to deny you health care. That‚Äôs not a gratuitous slam on health insurers. It‚Äôs actually sound policy for any profit-minded business. Every dollar an insurance company saves from paying on a claim is another dollar they can move to the bottom line. It‚Äôs why insurance in general doesn‚Äôt work Until ACA, health insurers were so blatant about arbitrarily rejecting and reducing claims that the fed had to pass a law requiring them to pay out at least 80% of their premium income in claims. But clever accounting and (of course) poor watch-dogging by the Trump administration created ways around that. So long as health insurance remains a for-profit entity, this fight between customer health and saving cash will never end. Greed never sleeps. Commercial health insurers exist to make a profit and those profits are huge. The top 8 health insurers made nearly $30 billion in profits in 2018. Insurance companies are quick to dismiss that as being consistent with other large industries. And, of course, businesses exist to make profits. I have no quarrel with that. But here‚Äôs the difference: unlike oil, automobile and tech companies health insurers create  nothing . They produce  nothing . They don‚Äôt even provide you with health care. That‚Äôs what the folks on the other side of the health transaction do. What they do is take a pile of money from consumers, stick it in a pool and distribute a large chunk of it to health care providers while keeping as much for themselves as they can. They are little more than glorified ticket scalpers marking up the price of health care for all of us. If you‚Äôve ever compared the cost of common medical procedures in the US against those of any other country on the planet you‚Äôll also see that insurers don‚Äôt even use their clout to hold down the price of health care (except for themselves). In fact, that would be counterproductive. The more a medical practitioner charges a patient the better for them because that‚Äôs how you motivate people to buy insurance. You make it prohibitively expensive for a consumer NOT to have insurance. When I was in college, before health insurers dominated health care, I paid $90 for an ER visit to New England Medical Center. And I got to see a real MD. Two years ago, I went to an NYU hospital ER with a cut on my arm. I was treated by a bored NP who only washed the wound with saline and gave me a bandaid. That‚Äôs all he would do without insurance company pre-approval. Out-of-pocket cost: $1650. I paid my $500 deductible. The insurance company paid $0. Considering that I paid about $7200 in premiums that year and had zero claims other than this, that was a pretty sweet deal for Aetna, my carrier. 100% profit.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-liberals-want-to-get-rid-of-private-insurance,"‚ÄúThey are little more than glorified ticket scalpers marking up the price of health care for all of us, the higher the better because that‚Äôs how you motivate people to buy their coverage.‚Äù Great analogy. Never thought of it that way but there is a lot of truth in that. Personally I‚Äôm a bit leery of just shutting down all the health insurance companies and putting many folks out of a job but your explanation makes a lot of sense. Healthcare would be cheaper by cutting out the unnecessary, highly paid, middle man.","You don‚Äôt seem to understand the concept of ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù. You probably think you pay a monthly premium and after that, everything is free. Well, that‚Äôs not what insurance is. Insurance is a risk pool for unusually hire expenses. If your insurance pays for anything but unexpected happenings, then it is not insurance. When (what year) were you in school for the $90 ER visit? Do you know why costs have risen so much since that time? Are you buying your health insurance today or is it employer paid health insurance. There are real explanations for what you have experienced.","Your answer takes the long route to my reply to anyone asking about this, or putting a Liberal vs. Conservative slant on it: Can you name one single country, that ever had US-style, for-profit, corporate-run healthcare and changed to universal or single-payer that EVER SWITCHED BACK AGAIN? And 2) regarding your huge profits for insurance companies, since thousands of Americans file for bankruptcy from medical bills every year, name insurance companies that have done the same. In every civilized modern country in the world that has universal care, I doubt many conservatives opt out of it for the privilege of giving their money to Big Insurance and told how, where and when they can get their money back.","Also note that even in the countries with so called free health insurance (Free at point of delivery) a robust private insurance market exists. It just does not cover basic health care coverage. What it does cover is the extras that basic health care coverage does not. Private rooms, extra equipment etc. Stuff that actually needs coverage.","Health insurance is nothing more than middlemen in the health industry, which makes the whole shebang very much more expensive. The business model is to get health services in the most direct way from the producers to end-users, and eliminate middlemen along the way. That in essence is what ACA is doing. American businesses are employing this business model in their industries. Most developed nations are doing this in their health industry with most gratifying results. So, why is the US - the supposed most advanced economic nation on earth - so resistant to this?"
Chip Shortage,Stock market pundits keep mentioning the global chip shortage. How will it affect tech stocks?,"In the long term? Not at all. In the short term? Depends on how irrational humans decide to slosh money around trying to get money from other irrational humans. Markets do not behave rationally over any length of time less than decades. However, the longer the term, the more rational the market‚Äôs behavior. A tech company might get slammed because of a belief that it needs the chips and won‚Äôt be able to get them. It might get elevated to new heights because of a belief that the chip shortage will push people to their already running ‚Äúcloud service.‚Äù It might not do anything.

Age of Empires 4,Is piracy killing the game industry?,"I am from Pakistan. Back when I was a teen-ager there was no legal way in Pakistan to buy original PC games and the only way to game was to get pirated games. During this time, playing pirated games, I got to play doom 2, civilizations 2 and 3, fable, deus ex invisible war, need for speed 3 hot pursuit and hot pursuit 2, football manager 2005 and 2006, elder scrolls 3 morrowind and elder scrolls 4 oblivion, mech warrior, Rome total war, galactic civilizations, neverwinter nights, age of empires and empire earth. There were other games but they were uninstalled within an hour or two of getting installed. Out of the games I've listed, I have legally purchased doom 3, civilizations 3, 4, 5 (waiting a couple more months before buying 6, experience with pre ordering 5 and buying beyond earth 2 months after release was extremely bad) and civilizations revolutions (on Xbox 360), fable and fable 2 (both on x360), deus ex human revolution (x360) and mankind divided, need for speed hot pursuit 2, need for speed underground, need for speed underground 2 and need for speed underground rivals, football manager 2007, 2011 and 2014, elder scrolls oblivion (x360) and elder scrolls skyrim, mech warrior 2 (x360, sadly it wasn't anything like the first game), total war compendium (there's way too many games in this series, I own them all, they were all purchased separately), galactic civilizations, neverwinter nights and neverwinter nights 2, age of empires and empire earth. I highly doubt i would've been the avid gamer that I am if I did not have access to pirated games when I was younger. All my mates are in the same boat as me and own a gaming PC and at least one console. Were those pirates games lost sales? Not really, we weren't in a market gaming companies were targeting and there wasn't any way we could've acquired games legally (short of traveling to a western country or getting someone in a western country to buy and send us the CDs/DVDs). Have the gaming companies, in the long term, benefited due to us playing pirated games? I think they have since there are millions of Pakistanis like me and my mates who started gaming with pirated games but are now legally buying games from steam, xbox live and psn, most of these people wouldn't have been gamers were it not for pirated games. Edit:  Thank you Tony Fisicaro for pointing out the mistake where I'd typed installed instead of uninstalled :-)",https://www.quora.com/Is-piracy-killing-the-game-industry,"Not just that but there are serious disincentives for not pirating at times, in the Philippines, even if you buy the legitimate copy of Xbox games, you couldn't even use live, or occasionally even get blocked just because of the IP address (it was very ironic that my aunt's Xbox 360 (no pirated games or apps at all) recently got blocked off when she works as a director in a company that provides support for Microsoft products)","I think what you describe also applies in countries where some or all games are available for purchase, but are outside the purchasing power of younger players who are still in school, or even working but are not well paid. As financial security increases, and $50 spent no longer interferes with ability to pay rent , so to does the propensity to just buy games. (much more convenient if nothing else). As in your country, I suspect the habit of buying games in later life is dependent on and evolves from availability of pirated games in years past, Win-win for game industry, as there is negligible actual loss of sales to people who have insufficient income to justify purchasing anyway, but there is a huge gain in the long term by insinuating games as ‚Äòobjects of desire‚Äôthat they cannot live without, while the consumer is still young and impressionable.","Same here from Brazil‚Ä¶ very few people around here had the money to buy legally as kids and piracy was too easy and cheap, so everyone just started playing pirated games, I being one of those. But now, as an adult and working person I was able to buy games on Steam - even those old games I played pirated versions, like the old Elder Scrolls, Baldur‚Äôs Gate and Civilizations. It‚Äôs an honor for me to pay for them retroactively, even if I don‚Äôt play Civ 3 or Morrowind anymore. Brazil is one of the countries where piracy is most rampant (on games, music, movies, etc). That‚Äôs both because the average income is too low and because pirated copies are too easily accessible‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs easier to find a pirated copy than a legit copy on the markets! And while the legit copy price range from R$150 to R$300 for games (like 1/3 of the average salary), the pirated copy range from R$5 to R$15, and if don‚Äôt work or if you didn‚Äôt liked that game you can even go back and change for a new copy or a new game!! And that‚Äôs the same for music and for movies.","Yep it was pretty much the same here too (Bahrain). Growing up too poor to buy authentic copies, but we grew up gamers so now that we‚Äôre working adults we spend hundreds and thousands on our hobbies. I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúwe‚Äù because this is pretty much the de facto situation to most current 20-somethings now, and our kids are growing up gamers -with authentic copies- from the start :3",Same in Russia. Back in 1990s we had an access only to the pirate copies of the popular games sold from the small illegal kiosks. But after introduction of Steam and GOG many Russians began to buy the games legally and many also bought the copies of the old games as an act of gratitude to the developers.

Jeff Bezos,What do you think of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos having an affair?,"I think that Trump is about to give the Saudis something in violation of American policy regarding Saudi Arabia. Just as the government shutdown was a distraction for lifting sanctions on Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska,-which the Russians have tried to do for decades and finally succeeded- during the chaos of the first shutdown. This outrage has basically not hit the American public's consciousness yet. The Bezos scandal, which seems to have been leaked through Saudi Arabia, followed a pro-Saudi Arabia puff piece published in the National Enquirer. But I don't think that's the end of that quid pro quo. Watch for more concessions to Russia and Saudi Arabia, especially during the shutdown that Trump is obviously planning and wants really badly to distract from some more goings-on behind the scenes. As cable media beats the drum on yet another shutdown, the GOP Trump Senators, especially Mitch McConnell, who are also in Russia‚Äôs pockets and Saudi Arabia's pocket, will be giving away more of America, piece by piece, while the cable media misses the main story.

In fact, the combined hours I studied in the first 14‚Äì15 years of my life (till Class X) was outnumbered by the hours I studied in XI and XII. I got 85% marks in my class X boards, not considered great by any stretch of imagination. I was in the state board (Rajasthan) and most of the answers had to involve a lot of mugging up and vomiting out the same in the exam hall. I loved to fly kites, cycling, playing cricket in the streets, trump cards, watching DBZ, Pokemon on Toonami, going to parks, playing PC games like Age of Empire, Counter strike and watching cricket. Not for a second I thought studying was important. In fact, for many exams in the board we used to get 3‚Äì4 days holiday. Out of this, the first 1‚Äì2 days I did not study anything and just used to chill. I had not heard of KVPY, Olympiads, NTSE and other ‚Äúprestigious examination‚Äù till then. I never attended any tuition / coaching till I entered class XI. My advice to all of you who are studying in class 6‚Äì10 is that do not take studies too seriously. Do not take life too seriously. You can prepare and get a top rank in IIT JEE, AIIMS, AIPMT, CLAT, CA, NEET etc. by studying just for 1.5‚Äì2 years. I just lived a typical middle class childhood in 1990s.

Chip Shortage,What caused the chip shortage in 2021?,"Semiconductor chips are the brains of almost all electronic devices and are part & parcel of some industries like the cellphone industry,the computer the motor vehicle industry. The shortage of chips initially began because of delayed production in factories shutting down due to the emergence of the COVID-19 virus in early 2020 all over the world. Simultaneously, remote work or work from home increased the demand for telecommunication devices.But,supply of chips was insufficient to meet such demand. The U.S.-China tech war also played a major factor in the global chip shortage. SMIC,which is one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in Asia was blacklisted by the US Dept. of Commerce. The inability to source US based parts to manufacture small chips had adverse effect for the supply chain of chips. Several companies, including Huawei Technologies Co.of China had anticipated the problem early and began stockpiling chips for the last two years.All of these factors have resulted in severe shortage of semiconductor chips in 2021.",https://www.quora.com/What-caused-the-chip-shortage-in-2021,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,"What's it like to receive a question mark e-mail from Jeff Bezos, at Amazon, Inc.?","At Amazon, I lead the ""Matching"" team, and I would get ? e-mails about once a month--generally whenever a merchant had a problem involving Amazon listing their products in the wrong part of a catalog. (E.g. ""I was selling the paperback but you listed me on the hardback and then customers got mad at me!"") Generally, the e-mail would go from a merchant to some friend of the merchant's who had some personal connection to Bezos. That friend would send it with some comment like, ""Jeff, you should look at this."" Jeff would forward it to his senior VP Sebastian Gunningham adding just ""?,"" and Sebastian would forward it directly to me. Since it happened so often, eventually Sebastian took to sending it straight to me and not ccing anyone else. I'd read it carefully and then assign it to someone on my team to review the logs and determine that the problem was in fact caused by our software. Much of the time, it would turn out that the ""switcheroo"" had been caused by something else. Other times it would turn out that the mismatch had occurred long ago (one case took 5 years between the mismatch and the time a customer actually tried to buy the product). And sometimes we'd find a real bug. While that research was happening, I would contact the executive escalation team, and they'd start putting together a formal response. They'd make sure we had the names of all the folks who really ought to be involved. That's especially important if the root cause lay outside my team. If the research looked like it would need more than 48 hours, we'd put together a preliminary response--possibly just for Sebastian.  Once we had a concrete explanation, then I'd draft a formal response and run it by the executive escalation folks. They'd point out things that were hard to follow or which seemed likely to provoke a negative response. When it all looked good, we'd send it off. Good responses would be things like: 1) The error was ours, but it was fixed long ago. If he had submitted his listing in the past 12 months, it would have been matched correctly. 2) This uncovered a bug, which we will fix in a deployment in 30 days. 3) The original match was correct but it was overridden by a customer service representative using a manual override tool. We have added a warning message to the tool for cases like this.  Executive Response would nag me every few days if the response were dragging out. It was generally better to send an incomplete response rather than take weeks and weeks trying to make a perfect one. Bias for Action counts at Amazon. Bad responses would be 1) We don't know what caused it; nothing in the logs is unusual. That would prompt a response asking, ""So what are you doing to make sure you've logged the right data in the future?"" ""Diving deep"" is another Amazon leadership principle. 2) We determined it isn't our problem. Nope. Ownership is another virtue at Amazon. Especially since other teams were less skilled in this area, we'd drive them to get the answers. I wasn't above threatening to tell Bezos that the root cause was ""Senior Manager X in group Y was uncooperative."" That got me yelled at a few times. :-) 3) AI problems like matching have a certain error rate which we simply have to budget for. Although this is the truth, Jeff and Sebastian already knew this. There would have been no excuse for failing to learn something from this particular problem and trying to find a way to reduce our error rate. A few times I did have to report that, despite many days of study, we were unable to identify the cause and that the best we could do was guess and add some new logging code to try to catch it if it happened again. Because I had to deal with so many Bezos escalations, I was quite good at it, and would often help others inside my division, who would generally freak out when they got a ""?"" e-mail. Finally, I determined early on that problems with book volume numbers were the cause of over half of the escalations I got from Jeff. If you order volume 2 but get volume 1, you'll be unhappy even if every other aspect of the book description were the same. Our project on ""small but significant differences"" eventually reduced the number of escalations that I received by over half.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-receive-a-question-mark-e-mail-from-Jeff-Bezos-at-Amazon-Inc,Quora Content Review could learn a thing or two about ‚Äúsmall but significant differences‚Äù with regard to merging questions.,"Hey, I currently work in Item Authority Team :)",Greg -- this is a badass answer.

Jeff Bezos,Why did Jeff Bezos invest in Business Insider?,"To put Bezos investment into context: even if he invested the full $5 million (which he didn't), given his net worth, it feels the same as $17.25 feels to the average American household.  He's not doing this for the return on the investment. Content doesn't pay. It just doesn't. Unless you get lucky. Really, really lucky. That's unfortunate. But it's the reality. Making money on creating original news content is extremely hard given declining CPMs in the space. It will become even harder over the next next few years as more traffic shifts to mobile, which doesn't monetize nearly as well as desktop.  And BI has been around long enough that there isn't going to be a sudden hockey stick. For the most part, it's shown losses, although I recall one year with a tiny profit. I haven't even tried to directly monetize my writing because I know how bad the economics are, especially for high quality analysis on a media model. I did it because I could afford to take some time out to take down a terrible business. (Groupon never did offer to ""buy out"" my blog or hire me to consult on special projects from Fiji with no internet access.) The comps in the broader media space aren't good. (Unless you own sports broadcast rights.) On the newspaper side, valuations are 1/10 of what they were 15 years ago. And newspapers benefit from advertisers' habits that have them paying really high rates for print.  Media investments (especially small ones) are usually about:
 Vanity.  Protection. Hey, if we're investors in X, they won't write bad things about us. I think this is less the case here because Amazon and Bezos are well regarded and established. BI isn't in a position to take Amazon down. That's not the case for startups. A lot of VCs invested in a recently launched tech blog and I'd bet this was the primary reason.  Charity. You want to see good brands and quality journalism continue to exist. This was the case with Sidney Harmon buying Newsweek. (For $1, plus assuming liabilities.) When Harmon died, his heirs didn't want to keep foooting the bill. Synergies/marketing. This was the case for Bloomberg's acquisition of Businessweek. In fact, all of Bloomberg's excellent news operation serves as a loss-leader for its lucrative terminal business.
There have been some exits in the content space, but they're generally not on the scale of tech companies. Here, I'm thinking of Weblogs, Huffington Post and TechCrunch. All three were bought by Aol. The TechCrunch exit was about Aol desperately seeking relevance and tech cred. (Which they promptly blew by how they handled the acquisition, pretty much from the get go.)  Based on the reported/rumored valuations for TechCrunch and Summly, Aol paid less for TC than Yahoo paid for a media story built around a 17-year-old kid. HuffPo was the most significant of these, but even that number was less than half of what Aol paid for Bebo.  In this case, Blodget helped to make Amazon in the .com boom.  As I said at the beginning, this is a completely insignificant amount of money to Bezos. I'd gladly give someone $20 if they'd do for me what Blodget did for Amazon. This is not a knock on either Bezos or Blodget. I do nice things for my friends, family and business associates that are similar in scale (relative to my net worth.) And others do that for me. Once, I helped a friend get a new job. He sent me a Kindle. (That was back when they were selling for $300.) I got another friend a choice assignment. He bought me an iPad. Both of these are much greater in scale (on a relative basis) than Bezos' investment in BI.",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Jeff-Bezos-invest-in-Business-Insider,Good lord this analysis is wretched.,Does Financial Times lose money?

Jeff Bezos,What made Jeff Bezos so successful?,"The biggest ones are Excellent strategy. He focused on the long-term, and not short-term. Timing. Of course, if he was born 300 years ago, or twenty years before World War Two, he wouldn't be where he is today. He had support during the early stages of Amazon. He is smart AND has business savvy. So, he knows how to execute, rather than just have great ideas, which are pointless in isolation. He focuses on the path of least resistance. One of the biggest reasons Amazon is so big is that they make buying easy AND they are cheaper. Even if Amazon was even cheaper than they are, they would suffer if the sales process was more difficult. People can buy with a click of a button. He ignores the naysayers, who always find excuses to say something won‚Äôt work. He didn‚Äôt give up after the crash of 2000 made people doubt the technology revolution. Focusing on delighting the customer, not just making them happy. Hard and smart work, rather than just one of the two. Smart work allows people to leverage, rather than just working harder for more incremental payments. All the above + luck/chance. As mentioned, even with all the above, he wouldn't have been abler to create Amazon if he was born before WW1. He was also born in the US, and not Cuba or many other countries. Here he is in his own words:  What is interesting about Bezos is he was often underestimated for years, unlike somebody like Gates or Musk, partially because he played the long game and doesn‚Äôt have a very imposing personality.

Jeff Bezos,How does Jeff Bezos motivate his Amazon employees?,"Jeff Bezos has a carrot and stick method to ‚Äúmotivate‚Äù his employees. Base salaries are slightly below par than competitors such as Google, Microsoft and Apple (in general, unless you have a very rare skill). The largest portion of your total compensation is offered in terms of RSUs (restricted stock units). It is not uncommon to provide over a $100,000 in Amazon RSUs to a freshly minted MBA. That‚Äôs where the evil takes over. Unlike Microsoft where the vesting schedule is even, at Amazon only 5% of your stock vests after year 1. The majority vests at the end of 4 years, which is why you will find many Amazonians quitting soon after their 4 year anniversary. Amazon also keeps a lookout on your ‚Äútotal compensation‚Äù. Let‚Äôs say the aMZN stock has done really well and you have a good pay year. Your stock grant that year is going to be a lot less simply because your total comp was high.

Jeff Bezos,How is Jeff Bezos different from other top startup founders/CEOs?,"Of the many CEOs that I hold in awe and respect Jeff Bezos is very high on the list. It is not that he has become successful and continues to remain the poster child of the Internet economy when other stars from the dot com era have either faded away or have been just one trick pony. The few things that amazes me about Jeff are: How Jeff continuously proved all the skeptics in the Wall Street and outside observers continuously wrong by being true to his vision, values and strategies. How he managed to scale the company from selling books to groceries and everything in between and become the world‚Äôs largest E-tailer. How he turned conventional wisdom on its head by combining and integrating constantly three widely different customer value disciplines‚Äîoperational excellence, customer intimacy and product leadership when it is generally believed that it cannot be done. How he has managed to not just radically alter business models and paradigms around retailing, but also transformed his company from a retailing firm to a high technology firm through continuous innovation. Finally how he has turned conventional thinking on advertising, innovation and customer service on its head and created new approaches. Well, a lot could be said of him, but I would just limit myself to some of the management nuggets that‚Äôs worth considering:  (Here ‚ÄúWe‚Äù refers to Amazon) The right way to build a brand is by delivering great service. Wetake those funds that might otherwise be used to shout about our service and put that into customer service. We work hard being customer-obsessed and expressing it through innovation Our two very strong cultural attributes are innovation and customer obsession. Frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out. Companies get skills-focused, instead of customer-needs focused. When [companies] think about extending their business into some new area, the first question is ‚Äúwhy should we do that‚Äîwe don‚Äôt have any skills in that area! I‚Äôll tell people that if the stock is up 30% this month, please don‚Äôt feel you are 30% smarter. Because when the stock is down 30% a month from now, it‚Äôs not going to feel that good to feel 30% dumber. I‚Äôve taken plenty of criticism, but it‚Äôs always been about our stock price and never about our customer experience. After the bubble burst, I would sit down with our harshest critics, and at the end of the meeting they would say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a huge customer.‚Äù You know that when your harshest critics are among your best customers, you can‚Äôt be doing that badly. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- Jeff brings out the distinction between  gifts and choices .

You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you‚Äôre not careful, and if you do, it‚Äôll probably be to the detriment of your choices.‚Äù How true! The tragedy for most people in the world is that they are blissfully unaware of the choices that they have! It becomes far more tragic when they ignore or dismiss the choices presented to them. Clearly they choose to wallow in their misery. The defining argument they give is what if the choice was wrong! To me (i.e. Jeff), maturity is not a function of age or even intelligence. It is the element when they become aware of their choices and making the right choice. To me, this distinction is just profound.",https://www.quora.com/How-is-Jeff-Bezos-different-from-other-top-startup-founders-CEOs,"This last comment about kindness refers to his comment he made to his grandma as a child‚Ä¶he told her he calculated her death based on her smoking and she broke down and cried.

OK $100 Million to my church. I‚Äôm at $146.6 Billion. Now, let‚Äôs buy / build a $100 Million estate in each of the following cities: New York Key West Paris London Vienna San Francisco Seattle Tokyo Monaco That takes me (roughly) down to $146.1 Billion. I could buy a ton of gold, but that only costs about $65 Million. Oh why not. I still have more than $146 Billion ($146,039,000,000 to be exact.) I could buy a private yacht. The History Supreme was made with solid gold and was recently sold for $4.8 Billion. I‚Äôll make an offer of $5 Billion. Now I‚Äôm down to $141 Billion. So I now have a private island, a private 747, estate homes all over the world, the 10 most expensive cars in the world, a private yacht made of gold, a ton of gold (just so I can say I have a ton of gold) and I‚Äôve given money to all my family.

I am writing you just hoping that you might read this letter seeking any kind of help and financial assistance for my childrens continuance of their studies. I am a freelance salesman of various industrial products but tragic incidents and unfavorable things that lead to the banning of my represented company to my only bread and butter client Robinsons land Corporation that belongs to the top corporations in our country slided down fast my financial capabilities to support their further studies. Being a father of 9 kids with me as the only bread winner is a very tough endeavour to fulfill, thats why i envy people like you who really made it big and good fortunes with your perseverance to get into the top. I love all my kids and would try to do everything for them to finish their studies for them to have a stable future because i did not finish college myself, and up to this age of mine at 53years old, my financial capabilities to support my family needs is still questionable and im already feeling weird things on my health even though i already stopped smoking and drinking for more than 2 years, i abused myself to such vices when i was 20years old as a working student back then, i had to work because both of my parents that time of my life suffered strokes and paralyzed half of their bodies. My father was a retired Marines 2nd lieutenant and my mother was a former school teacher and their very small pensions hardly enough to cover their medicines and personal needs for them to still live longer. My father died only after a year of suffering stroke but we were able to keep our mother alive for around 20 more years when she died in 2009. I am separated from my legal wife myself for more than 20 years, yes i got into early marriage accidentally and got her pregnant and we had a daughter to whom ive been estranged since she was only 8years old because my in-laws hid her from me back then. I never had the chance to fight for my fatherly rights to my daughter due to lack of financial capabilities because im just earning then a low meager income that can hardly support my parents that suffered strokes, so i just give up the fight ,until i met my partner now and mother of my 9 children at present, we had an ups and downs stages in financial status because i never had a very good and honorable employer in my long sales career. I got gypped of thre right amounts of commissions for my hard works and after providing them with many clients and projects/orders that i gained in my fieldworks. It was those unfortunate circumstances that up to my present stage of my life, i cannot really asure i can support my 9 children to have a good future. I was hoping that with my eldest Daughter at 19years old and my talented son Mark at 16yrs old, if i can have them finish their college studies and finish their dream courses. they will eventually help their other younger brothers and sisters to also support their studies. Im not asking so much help but only some support and little financial assistance for my children to have them finish their studies, Most of my children belongs to the top 10 of their class and 1 of them achieved the class valedictorian in gr. 6 topping at least more than a thousand other graduating students of gr 6 last April of this yeaI just wish you coul read this letter of mine soon, and consider sending any help not for me but for my own kids, im positive they will be able to have good futures and careers someday if they can finish their studies, i have been keeping them away from bad vices, bad friends and specially away from illegal drugs for their own good. Helping other people even strange ones like us who are very far away from your country will bring you more blessings, besides it will be for a good and noble cause. Like i said Mr. Jeff, im just trying to do everything for my childrens good future, If you will send help, it would be a forever gratitude and lifetime favor that we will treasure for the rest of our lives, and given the opportunity someday, i will advise my kids to do the same generosity and kindness that you will be able to extend to our family, that is a promise sir that we will fulfill.

Jeff Bezos,"If Jeff Bezos tried to liquidate his wealth, how much could he actually obtain?","I am certainly no expert in finance at this level but I have thought about this a lot for several of the other billionaires. There are several ways to go about this and each with various pros and cons. If he tried an out right sale on the stock market it would take a long time because the market is based on supply and demand. If he suddenly dumped 10 million of his shares of Amazon on the market it would naturally drop to well under half of what it is now because it would take a lot of time and a lot of buyers to snap up $17.3 billion in stock. The stock would crash even further by all the owners of Amazon who thought - gee whiz if Jeff is getting out - something bad must be about to happen. So they would sell. his last 1 million shares would bring in way less than his first million shares. Now, a more logical way would be for him to discuss it with several large investment management firms and sell directly in a private sale and that way the price would not fluctuate and they would never be on the open market. He could probably do it this way and sell out 90% with no more than a 5% hit over the last 30 days average price. Of course selling his stock would trigger income tax but his would be long term capital gains and he could pay his 15% tax and still walk away with probably over $100 billion.:) Not bad - unless we get a president that hates capitalism and seeks to confiscate (steal) all the wealth in the country.

Jeff Bezos,What was it like to study at Princeton with Jeff Bezos?,"TL; DR: I remember nothing.   (from his high school yearbook, I couldn't find any college pictures) As a student he didn't stand out. I'm sure I ran into him plenty of times, our department only had 20 graduates in 1986, but I have only the vaguest memory if any. I believe he had hair back then, but he was not nearly as good looking (or as tall) as classmates Brooke Shields (a year behind) or Michelle Obama. You have to remember, he wasn't famous back then, and there were brilliant people everywhere. If he was more brilliant than anyone else, perhaps he showed that to his professors and lab partners, but there was a strict social code at Princeton of not bragging or showing off. No matter how hard you worked or how well you did, you were expected to shrug it off, act nonchalant, as if everything was cool and easy. People like Brooke, Moulay Hicham (Prince of Morocco), some sons of big company CEOs, and so on, were already famous and sought after. Others like Art Ferri (owner of the notorious student pizza agency) or  Irfan Kamal  (popular guy, class president) were famous for their exploits on campus. By contrast, we ""EECS geeks"" (there was no separate computer science department back then; Electrical Engineering and Computer Science was part of the engineering school) were a quiet, overwhelmingly male group of eccentric misfits. Engineering was definitely harder work and more of it than most other departments, except perhaps math, physics, and architecture. There was a little ceremony during graduation week for just our department. I was one of two or three students who got high honors and I remember being jealous of the two kids who got highest honors, it was that C+ I got in statistics.

It affects motorcycles too, but to a lesser extent because motorcycles have fewer systems and gadgets to control compared to cars, and the high end motorcycles that use a good deal of electronics are produced in far smaller numbers. Part of the problem was also that car manufacturers initially revised demand predictions and thus slashed orders to chip production foundries, but then when people started to buy cars in higher than predicted numbers, chip makers could not accommodate the revised demand. The vast majority of low cost, low capacity motorcycles use much smaller chips and the contracts for those are quite stable, so chip manufacturers have a more predictable production schedule.",https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-chip-shortage-for-motorcycles-or-just-cars,,,,,

Jeff Bezos,Why does Jeff Bezos only own 16% of Amazon?,"Initally, a company holds 100% of its stock. Shares of stock are granted to co-founders in varying percentages based on their company role, when they join the company, salary versus equity, etc. As money is raised in rounds, shares are provided in exchange for money. As an example, suppose 100% of the shares were held by the founder. It comes time to raise money. The founder and investors negotiate a $2M investment for 33% ownership in the company (pre-money of $4M, $6M post-money after the $2M investment is received). The founder now only has 67%. Go through another round and there is dilution on all shareholders. Suppose the next round raises $5M for 33% ownership, pre-money is now $10M, up from $4M. The first round investors now have 2/3 of 1/3, or 2/9 (roughly 22% of the company with their $2M investment now worth approximately $3.3M). The founder is also diluted, 2/3 of 2/3, or 4/9, and now holds ~44%, with the new investor holding the remaining 33%. Do a few investment rounds and the founder is diluted to under 20% in the case of Jeff Bezos.

Be opinionated on everything but develop a habit of listening to others. If possible develop habit of public speaking and debating. Make your voices heard. 4.  Dont be bored:  some might tell you to read the Hindu or read ncerts. Why? Issues change. Read what you like.

Let me explain‚Ä¶:)  Chance No. 1 Despite being born with a silver spoon, he was great in both sports and studies . By the age of 22, he has topped his matriculation , passed out from the most prestigious college in Calcutta ( Kolkata now ) with honors, and has even cracked the super difficult ICS exams held in London, to become one of the few ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô civil servants of India. He is all set to live in luxury and opulence for the rest of his time on this planet. What can go wrong? Life set right? No.  He resigns from civil services to become a volunteer agitator against the British Colonialism. Gets beaten, thrashed, and even jailed. Must be a proud moment for his parents.  Chance no. 2 By the age of 33, he comes out of prison - becomes the editor of a newspaper - gets elected as the mayor of Calcutta - he has money, power and influence - things are looking up - family life was going great. Gets to travel to Europe - meet powerful guys like Benito Mussolini. What can go wrong? Life set right? No.  Chooses to be an activist mayor and a revolutionary editor. Miffs the Britishers - Gets arrested again and is sent to a prison in Mandalay .  Chance no. 3 By the age of 41 ( which is 6 years younger to Shri Rahul ji ), life looks up again - he‚Äôs out of prison - World is getting ready for World War 2 - British Power is distracted - he‚Äôs got enough national popularity now to even get nominated to the prestigious post of the  President of the Indian National Congress  - All that is required of him is to just pretend to agree with Gandhi‚Äôs views on Swaraj - What can go wrong? Life set right? No.  He decides to show no moral flexibility - defies Gandhi - still wins the election against a candidate supported by Gandhi - fails to impress everyone in the Congress Working Committee, and thus resign . What‚Äôs more - the Britishers put him under house arrest.  Chance no. 4 Despite whatever has happened so far - now, he‚Äôs safe at home, amidst his loved ones - relaxed and cheerful. There are armed sepoys posted outside his home - but they do not bother much. He can write, read and even practise some Yoga, it is 1940, the war is on - looks like the Britishers might agree to finally give freedom to India - all he has to do, is sit and wait and he could easily become someone important and big - May be even the Prime Minister - What could go wrong? Life set right? No.  He grows a heavy beard - changes his name to Mohammed Ziauddin , a Pakhtun from Afghanistan, and escapes from his posh home off Elgin street in Calcutta - right under the nose of the British Empire. While the British intelligence is wondering - he meets with German leadership and secures funding and resources - Hitchhikes on a submarine to reach Sumatra - Revamps the Indian National Army - Establishes the  Provisional Government of Free India  - Fights with the British forces in North-Eastern India - and most probably dies while being at it ( we don‚Äôt know for sure ).  Despite all this, his political party disowned him. His partners and fellow leaders of the  Azad Hind Fauj  were dishonored and disbanded. His own countrymen never came around to thank him officially. And today, there are a few fellow Indians, who only want to remember him as a wannabe a Nazi. Boom!

Chip Shortage,Will the chip shortage possibly alter the manner in which vehicles have been manufactured?,"Hi Stef, The shortage has stopped production of many vehicles but it will not cause vehicle design and production to revert to the past. There is way too much technology in vehicles to discontinue the use of microchips that control just about everything in a vehicle. A vehicle might have as many as 1,500 microchips depending on how it is equipped. If microchips are deleted, consumers will no longer have all the options, accessories, driver assist systems and required safety and emission controls. Vehicles are computer controlled. This will not change in the future although once internal combustion engines are eliminated, microchips for engine functions might be put to use to control electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and other devices. This year alone, carmakers are losing billions of dollars due to the shortage. Certainly, they are taking steps to prevent future microchip shortages. Also, chip manufacturers are spending billions of dollars to expand their operations to meet future vehicle production demand.

  As a 200-year drought hit the Indus Valley, the civilization started moving much more east and south. There is a period of Indian history from 1500 BCE - 500 BCE, where we clearly don't know what happened. 600 BCE - The Age of Empires
This is the era of the Mahajanapadas and Mahabharata is believed to have happened in this period. The 11 in the map below is the Kuru kingdom (of Kauravas).

 323 BCE - Invasion of Alexander
After various wars (some of them immortalized in Indian epics), the Magadhas started consolidating really big under the Nanda Empire. This is how India looked after Alexander attacked India. The Magadhas however didn't get a chance to fight the great conquerer.

 200 BCE Rise of the Mauryas
The attack of Alexander left some Indians, like the Taxila professor Chanakya, really angry and a massive empire followed the Nandas. It was build by Chandragupta and watered by Ashoka. For the first time, all of India came under 1 rule. Even the south Indian kings for the first time became vassals to Ashoka.

 100 BCE - the rule of Indo-Greeks
Good things end eventually and after a century, the Mauryans were done. This time a whole bunch of Indo-Greeks (from various intermarriages) started taking over. Period of confusion like the period before 300 BC.

 1 CE - Consolidation begins
Around this time, things again started to consolidate. The Indo-Parthians, Indo-Scythians (cross between Indians and Central Asians), Satvahanas of Andhra and Kalingas of Orissa ruled vast territories. You can already see Manipur in North East appearing now.

 100 CE - The Kushans Take over
This is the period when the Central Asians had a lot of influence. Emperor Kanishka was the best of the lot and many central Asian nations became a part of India. The capitals were Peshawar, Taxila, Mathura and Bagram (Afghanistan). Satvahanas still rule the south and they were responsible some of the equisite art of central India - Amaravati and Sanchi.

 480 CE- Guptas at the peak
After the Kushanas came the Guptas - the golden age of India. They took India to its heights in culture, economy and science. You can also see that the south has its first change in a long time (Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas replaced by the Kalabharas) and the Kamarupa kingdom of Assam gaining momentum. Kalingas would also be reduced greatly

 500 CE- Tragedy strikes India
After 2 centuries of rule, the Guptas are finally pushed back by the Hunas of Central Asia. Central Asian nomads also destroyed the Sassanids and Romans in the same period. Like the Mauryas and Nandas, they ruled from Patna.

 600 CE Harsha's empire
After the fall of the Guptas, Emperor Harsha would take the fight to the Hunas and drive away the invaders. He would try to bring some of the golden age of Guptas back, but his empire would break as soon as he died. You can also see that the Kalabharas have finally been taken over by the Chola, Chera, Pandyas of the south. After this, Kalabharas would be completely wiped from Tamil conscience. The Pallavas would start to flex their muscles and build some of the great rock-cut temples, such as Mahabalipuram.

 800 CE Rise of the Palas
This was a Buddhist kingdom from the east of India. The Palas took the Gupta build Nalanda university to its heights.

 900 CE - Kannauj Dynasty reigns
The Gurjars from Kannuj (Uttar Pradesh) would run over the Gupta territory in the north. In the south, the Rashtrakutas and Cholas would fight for supremacy.

 1000 CE - The rise of Cholas
The Rashtrakutas would give way to the Chalukyas in the south and the north would be divided. It is in this period that the Cholas of south would begin their domination, especially over South East Asia. They would control Sri Lanka and a lot of SE Asia.
  Can you see the looming Ghaznavid empire at the top left? They will slowly start moving into India. 1200 CE- India under siege
This was among the worst periods for India, as the Ghurid Sultanate ate into northern India. Famous universities like Nalanda were destroyed. The south would also implode due to various reasons.

 1400 CE Delhi Sultanates & Vijayanagara
North and South would be quite divided in this age. The Afghans of the north would consolidate under the Delhi Sultanate, while south would be consolidated under the Vijayanagar Empire. Some great works of art emerged on both sides.

 Mughals (1605- 1707)
The Delhi Sultanates gave way to the Mughals who ruled for about 150 years. Some of the great architecture of the north, such as the Taj Mahal was built around this period. After losing its native kingdoms, south continues to be in a state of restlessness.

 1750 CE Marathas
The Marathas under Sivaji and later kings would start to eat away Mughal empire and had a good chance to consolidate India. However, they would fight with the Ahmad Shah Abdali of Afghanistan and lose in the 3rd battle of Panipat. Their fall would make it easy for the East India Company.

 India map 1857
East India Company starts chewing in the pieces left by the Marathas and built an empire. In 1857 this empire was taken over by the British Crown.

 1930 - British Raj
Until 1937, Britain uses its Indian Raj to control their possessions in Asia. Burma was then cut off from India. Ceylon was never under Indian control though as Britain didn't find it as profitable. However, they moved people from India into Ceylon and Malaysia.

 1947 - The Dawn of Freedom
Here is what India looked just before the partition on August 15, 1947.

 India in 1953 - State Reorganization
In 1953, India started reorganizing states on linguistic lines.

 Present
This is our India of the present. It stands like a person with wide open arms.

 Summary:
Like all nations of the world, India's boundaries wax and waned through the last 5000 years of history. Here is the graph of various Indian empires and what % of the subcontinent they ruled back then. For instance, Mauryas ruled 80%+ of the subcontinent and were between 300-200 BCE. Mughals ruled almost 90%. This first gives you an idea of different empires and their maximum extents.

Jeff Bezos,What are the less known facts about Jeff Bezos?,"Here are some lesser known facts about Amazon founder and world's richest man  Jeff Bezos.  1.His birth name isn‚Äôt Jeff Bezos ‚Äî it‚Äôs  Jeffrey Preston Jorgenson. His parents got a divorce when he was just a year old. Her mother later married Miguel Bezos, who was an immigrant from Cuba, when Jeff was four. Jeff took his name, and he would be known as Jeff Bezos from then on. 2 .In 1999, when Amazon was just taking off, Time magazine named him its  Person of the Yea r. US News & World Report called him one of America‚Äôs best leaders in 2008, and Fortune magazine named him its Businessperson of the Year in 2012. One of his creations has also won big awards; the  Amazon Kindle  won an Innovation Award from The Economist in 2011. 3. Bezos is decidedly against using the  PowerPoint  at Amazon or any of his businesses. Instead, he asks his employees to actually write out their ideas and proposals, sometimes as long as five or six pages. Doing things this way, he believes, encourages greater creative thinking rather than relying on the simplicity of bullet points to convey an idea. 4.Bezos has had not just one, but two near death experiences. The first was in 2001, when he was in Seattle during a harrowing 6.9 magnitude earthquake. What was even more harrowing, though, was that he was nearly crushed by a tungsten ball weighing 20 pounds. He had to crawl under a table to get out of its way. The next near death experience was in 2003, when he was in a helicopter crash. As the story goes, the helicopter he boarded near Alpine, Texas took off, hit a strong air current, and crashed soon thereafter. Bezos suffered only a few cuts and bruises, but the experience was scary enough that he avoids getting into helicopters anymore. 5.Bezos isn‚Äôt above the menial tasks. As such, every Amazon employee ‚Äî including himself ‚Äî is required to work as a customer service representative for two days every two years. It helps everyone in the company ‚Äî again, including himself ‚Äî develop what it takes to provide that level of service to the company‚Äôs clientele. 6.Bezos has an unforgettable laugh: it‚Äôs hysterical bordering on fully maniacal. 7 .As far as work teams or work meetings are concerned, Bezos has an approach that is often referred to as ‚Äú The Two Pizza Rule .‚Äù It works like this: if you need more than two pizzas to feed the people involved, it‚Äôs too big. Despite its name, this rule has nothing to do with eating pizzas and helps in better communication through a decentralized organizational structure. 8.After he finished up his studies at Princeton, Bezos was interested in a job with a Wall Street tech startup company. He took a with  Fitel , a company that created stock tracking software. After two years, Fitel was sold, and Bezos moved to a job with the Bankers Trust Company. Two years later, he was hired by  D.E. Shaw , an investment management firm, and in the ensuing few years, he worked his way up to a Senior Vice President position. In fact, he was the company‚Äôs youngest ever vice president. He stayed there until 1995, when he left of his own accord to launch  Amazon , and the rest, as they say, is history.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-less-known-facts-about-Jeff-Bezos,Interesting facts about Jeff bejos ,,,,
Swiss Chocolate,What incident on an airline got you a good compensation?,"Two incidents Was coming back from a trip to India a year ago. Got delayed at security check, so I was one of the late passengers Walking to my seat, I see two girls along with the air hostess, waiting for me, requesting a seat exchange. I was alone and had some fever. All I needed was to sleep, so I said ok. Air hostess took me to business class and offered me a seat there. The issue was, there were a few visually impaired girls flying first time for a conference. Each one of them had an accompanying person but by mistake they got seats in different aisles. So they were rearranging the seats. By the time I went in, there were no seats available unless they move me to far end or business. Glad they did business. 2.

Chip Shortage,How did car makers collide with a global chip shortage?,"The global automotive industry is an extremely complex system of retailers, automakers and suppliers. The last group includes larger suppliers such as Robert Bosch or Continental AG that source chips for their products from smaller, more-focused chip manufacturers such as  NXP Semiconductors  or  Renesas . A kink in the supply chain during any part of the process can have a tremendous ripple effect across production. ‚ÄúThis is a classic example of the bullwhip effect,‚Äù said Razat Gaurav, CEO of supply chain software and analytics firm Llamasoft. ‚ÄúSmall changes in demand, as they propagate further upstream in the value chain, the variability and the volatility grows dramatically.‚Äù Much of the problem begins at the bottom of the supply chain involving ‚Äúwafers.‚Äù The wafers are used with the small semiconductor to create a chip that‚Äôs then put into modules for things like steering, brakes and infotainment systems. A 26-week lead time is needed to build the chips before they are installed in a vehicle, according to Hau Thai-Tang, Ford‚Äôs chief product platform and operations officer. The origin of the shortage dates to early last year when Covid  caused rolling shutdowns  of vehicle assembly plants. As the facilities closed, the wafer and chip suppliers diverted the parts to other sectors such as consumer electronics, which weren‚Äôt expected to be as hurt by stay-at-home orders. ‚ÄúThose chip manufacturers as well as wafer manufacturers started redeploying their capacity to like consumer electronics, which was growing because of people working from home and virtual working patterns,‚Äù Thai-Tang said during an investor conference last year. ‚ÄúFast forward, if you add 26 weeks to when they made those decisions, the drop-off or the trough in the supply started to hit automotive the latter half of last year, going into Q1.‚Äù But demand for new vehicles  was more resilient than expected  during the shutdowns, particularly by consumers, so the industry recovered far quicker than anyone expected. As that happened, chip suppliers were continuing to divert resources away from automotive, and they‚Äôre attempting to play catch-up with demand from the automotive industry. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no easy way out of this,‚Äù said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research. ‚ÄúLast year we knew that once they were able to flatten the curve and get safety protocols in place, they could return to production. That‚Äôs not the case now. We‚Äôve got really long lead times and more and more demand on chips.‚Äù How Covid led to a $60 billion global chip shortage for the auto industry",https://www.quora.com/How-did-car-makers-collide-with-a-global-chip-shortage,,,,,

Age of Empires 4,What is the best civilization in Age of Empires III?,"According to me, the best civilization would be ‚Ä¶. OTTOMANS The reasons are too simple: They can be used as a good Rushing Civilization as well as Fast Fortress technique(Best) Produce free villagers with each and every town center. So the best strategy is to use the card for two town centers and use mosque to build villagers faster and automatically. You don‚Äôt need to think every time about the villagers because they keep on producing on their own. Great military units : The Janissary and the albus guns are good. The cavalry is also good. But what adds to it are the GREAT BOMBARD which are totally over powering. GREAT BOMBARDS : The unit which I personally like the most is great bombard. Build some albus guns with great bombards and no one can stop you. Use FAST FORTRESS to go to AGE4 quickly and then make 2 Factories ( using card and wagon). So you‚Äôll get double great bombards and make a fantastic military. No need of making Artillery units if you have GREAT BOMBARDS. So, you save so much of gold and artillery (bombards) are produced cost effective but affecting only the population. In a map like Amazonia ( with river ) where you need mortars to destroy enemy ships . No need of making mortars when you can build bombards for free. Limiting the number of villagers to your like. The villagers are added in numbers in the series 25,45,70,99 . So you can control the pace as well as number of villages : military count easily. I think that even if anyone thinks there are some cons to that then it‚Äôs a trade off by these huge advantage that OTTOMANS provide. If you are playing a 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 .. you should ask him to build cavalry and infantry rather than focusing on artillery.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-civilization-in-Age-of-Empires-III,"This is good but it has one big problem. You can‚Äôt control villagers population. In the beginning you may want to have 99 villagers but as time goes on, you may want go have only 50.

He was working as a Wall Street Investment Banker. He came across an interesting statistic in 1994 which put number of web users grow at 2300 percent year. He was drawn by this figure and decided to jump into e-commerce. He made a list of top 20 things which he could sell and decided to sell books because of their universal appeal.  He named the company Amazon after the river to bring about the scale of the business with the initial tagline ""Earths biggest book store"". Rest is history. Interesting trivia - There was a bell in the garage where Amazon was started. It rang each time they received an order. By the end of first month, Amazon shipped books to 50 states in US and 45 countries worldwide. The bell was continuously ringing and Jeff had to discontinue the practice.

Jeff Bezos,"Who is a better person, Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos?","I do not know either of them personally, though I would gladly take either out for a beverage of their choice to see if the man behind the brand resembles the brand in any meaningful way. We can only judge them upon the brands and companies they have created. Let us begin with Jeff Bezos. I want to pick a few holes in any mythology that Mr. Bezos is trying to build. I have personally observed Amazon break the law. I have caught them in fraud, raised that fraud to the level of public knowledge, and seen lawmakers and legal authorities turn a blind eye. This of course sounds rediculous, so let‚Äôs talk about the day I caught one of America‚Äôs largest retailers breaking the law, and how little that bothered them. The setting is Saturday, July 22, 2017. A quiet midwestern city, not particularly any more interesting than any other. The cargo is pretty boring, a few books. Amazon made their fortune being a book retailer, everything else is window dressing compared to delivering books to people. There is no excuse for being bad at this, from this customer‚Äôs point of view. Amazon thought it would be amusing to engage in mail fraud, an occurance that I am led to believe by their response is a daily activity. Mail fraud is when you charge a customer for a product and do not deliver, yet claim you have. It has been illegal since 1876. So Amazon, and the carrier they insist on using for their guerunteed two day shipping, said they had delivered a package containing $120 worth of books. No such delivery occurred. My fiance and I sat in our home all day, and believe me we wanted these books and were checking. I contacted no less than three Amazon reps, all of whom informed me that their fraud was my problem. This is known in the law as buyer beware. Yet, I informed them that the law was in fact on my side, and even if it wasn‚Äôt, this sort of behavior is not particularly good business. They informed me upon their total apathy. They reshipped the package and I received it. In the meantime I had to pay an additional $200 for the same books at a brick and mortar store, which I had refunded, but Amazon absolutely refused to issue a refund for the funds they stole. Further I informed them that the word ‚ÄúGuarantee‚Äù is generally defined as: ‚Äúa formal promise or assurance (typically in writing) that certain conditions will be fulfilled, especially that a product will be repaired or replaced if not of a specified quality and durability.‚Äù(Google definition, fetched today) Amazon has been found in default of this formal promise no less than 20 times in my case. This time I caught Amazon in outright fraud. They have never made adequate recompense. They could not care less. I effectively loaned Amazon this amount of money while they tried to figure out how to do their job. I‚Äôm not in a habit of subsidizing failing businesses. In twelve years of working I have never encountered a business that has to steal from loyal customers to survive and is not failing. I suppose that Amazon is not only failing, their business model has failed. I look forward to removing my money from their pocket at every opportunity. Someday perhaps they will win my business back, but this is just the most ridiculous of many unethical things this company has done with and to me. I have records, if there is ever a class action lawsuit this company will be cutting me a fat fucking check. There will be no check, because Amazon doesn‚Äôt even have the money to deliver fucking books on time. Mr. Bezos has a fortune founded upon cheating customers such as me out of money upon false pretenses. He may be the most lovable and decent human being in existence, and I hope sincerely that he has no earthly idea that his company routinely performs such actions. I know it is their every desire that the public not know how unethical they behave, but there you are. Mr. Gates, on the other hand, has been at the top for a long time. His company and I have done multiple transactions over twenty two years of a healthy if a bit tense business relationship. They have NEVER committed fraud. They have never made a promise that they could not keep. They have delivered on every single legal requirement, and further made every effort to offer me free product if they ever thought I had even the slightest negative impression of their company. Microsoft may be expensive, but they are honest about it. I prefer honesty and good ethics to admit it. Mr. Gates‚Äô fortune has been built upon the strong backs of American workers, by servicing and providing work for us to participate in. If Microsoft wasn‚Äôt what it is, computing wouldn‚Äôt be what it is today, for better or worse. Bill Gates may in his private life be the most hateful and unpleasant man in existence. I, as I said at the outset, cannot determine that. I only can judge a man by the work of his hands. Christ said, ‚ÄúBy their fruits you shall know them.‚Äù Therefor I know these two men to an extent. I would spend a long car ride with Mr. Gates any day, at no cost apart from conversation. Mr Bezos, or Mr. Bozos as I will call him henceforth, must compensate me for my time, and if he wants to talk to me or listen to his own music he must supply earplugs for me and more money. Mr. Bezos, in effect, can go fuck himself. I want to wrap this all up with the fact that I am working on forgiving the poor people that have been conned into the organized chaos that is the company I used to know. I don‚Äôt think that a single human is to blame, I think it‚Äôs apathy on the part of society, and apathy on the part of consumers. I blame myself, because for years I have fed and supported unethical activity. As was the case with Enron and VW, we may never have the answers as to what really happened here. I just know my perspective. A crime was committed, and instead of pressing charges I chose to forgive. I hope the day never comes that I have to choose any other way. Max H. Malcolm-

Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos an ethical businessman?,"Amazon, as embodied and driven by Jeff Bezos, is an ethical company from my experience. That does not mean that they don‚Äôt push the envelope and operate differently than other companies, but they follow laws and are a difficult partner. I was taught that a good deal is a ‚Äúwin-win.‚Äù There are companies that have dealt with Amazon that feel that they acted as the 800 pound gorilla and it was not a win-win. That said, nothing made the other company have to take a bad deal. It fits with the adage, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt live with them, and you can‚Äôt live without them.‚Äù In the 90s or mid-2000s, Amazon had a fulfillment center in Pennsylvania that was not air-conditioned. These are facilities larger than football fields and it would cost in excess of $50M to air condition the facility (keeping it at 85*). At that time, Amazon was barely generating that much cash annually. Once the press started reporting on ambulances parked in the parking lot to treat employees for heat stroke, Amazon relented and air conditioned the facility to avoid the bad press. Ethical? Yes.

Age of Empires 4,Which game is better-Clash of Clans or Age of Empires?,"This is a very common question in the gamer world and one of the hot topics of discussion which sometimes leads to heated arguments. To answer the question it is very important to understand the difference between these two games. Age Of Empires was one of the most played game during the late 90s and early 2000s. I was introduced to this game when I was a 10 year old and loved it ever since. The game required you to work out a lot of strategies and you would need a lot of planning ahead and executing the plans accordingly. It was a long process. I remember how a well played game used to last close to 3‚Äì4 hours and the game demanded your time. Patience was the key. The trend back then was such that people weren‚Äôt yet adapted to the fast lifestyle that we have right now. Back then, things took a lot of time to complete and we were okay with that. The lifestyle was such that people had patience to sit and strategize and play without expecting quicker results. However on the other hand, Clash of Clans is designed for the new so called ‚Äú4G Generation‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt ask you to sit in front of a machine channeling all your patience for hours together. It is more of a ‚ÄúOn the Go‚Äù game. You‚Äôre travelling and you think you can spare a minute, all you need is couple of taps and you‚Äôre good to go. So far a person who‚Äôs used to the new lifestyle, COC would be the choice.

Jeff Bezos,"If Jeff Bezos owns only 16 percent of Amazon, then how is he the owner of Amazon?","He is an owner of Amazon, as is anyone who own shares of Amazon stock. Amazon has many owners, possibly millions of them. At 16%, Jeff Bezos is a major shareholder, and I expect the largest one - if someone had more shares, I think we‚Äôd know about that person. There are really very few large corporations that are owned 100%, or even close to 100%, by someone. The whole reason for making a corporation public is so you can sell shares to raise funds. There are firms that are 100% owned by their founders (or possibly by other people, such as their heirs). However, if a firm was never taken public, then it had to rely on internally generated cash flow or debt to finance its growth. That makes it harder for the firm to grow quickly, and consequently, the largest firms are typically  not  100% owned by anyone. If they remain 100% founder-owned, they usually don‚Äôt grow as much. It also behooves the owner of a firm to diversify their holdings. If nearly all of Jeff Bezos‚Äòs wealth is in the form of Amazon stock (I don‚Äôt know whether it is or not), and Amazon fails, he‚Äôll be broke. You may find that silly, and it may well never happen, but history is full of formerly high-flying companies that eventually went bankrupt and liquidated. So if Jeff Bezos doesn‚Äôt fancy spending his golden years working the counter at 7/11, he might want to (if he hasn‚Äôt already) sell some of his Amazon stock and buy some other things. That way, even if Amazon fails, he‚Äôll still be rich. Founders of firms may well choose to sell off some of their stock for this reason, even if the firm doesn‚Äôt need additional shareholders to fund its growth.",https://www.quora.com/If-Jeff-Bezos-owns-only-16-percent-of-Amazon-then-how-is-he-the-owner-of-Amazon,Is it just me.

Moving from millionaire to billionaire may seem to be a linear function, but functionally it‚Äôs not. While it is possible that someone may reach trillionaire status, unless something changes drastically, we are likely to see significant growth in personal wealth slowing in pace over the next several years. There are economic realities that limit the rate at which individuals can increase their wealth, and the process tends to be punctuated. Musk is likely to be expelled from both SpaceX and Tesla at some point, because his erratic behavior will eventually become such a liability that even his echo chamber boards won‚Äôt tolerate him. Jeff Bezos is more concerned now, with becoming some SciFi legend than simply increasing his personal wealth. At the pace they‚Äôre moving, I think it‚Äôs more likely that someone other than either of those two would be a better candidate to eventually become a trillionaire.",https://www.quora.com/Who-is-going-to-be-the-first-trillionaire-Elon-Musk-or-Jeff-Bezos,Why are the rich hated so much?,Sounds about right.,,,

As you can see from this graphic, it‚Äôs pretty hard to put any one individual ahead of all else. Augustus Caesar is only rumored to have had that much wealth. John Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie are the richest Americans of all time. Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates are among the richest ever. Edit: Personal wealth has not been the same throughout history, though. For some of these figures, their land ownership is used to calculate their wealth. I personally believe Mansa Musa, Rockefeller and Carnegie, and Jeff Bezos were the most influential. They each  revolutionized  and/or controlled a massive industry. Musa controlled the gold/salt trade, Rockefeller developed and controlled oil, Carnegie controlled steel, and now Bezos revolutionized shopping. Photo was found on Google Images",https://www.quora.com/Is-Jeff-Bezos-the-richest-American-or-human-in-history-Who-has-been-richer,Its meaningless to even attempt to quantify an emperors/King wealth. Always hated lists that included them. The list quickly turns into who was the most ‚Äòpowerful‚Äô emperor. Augustus would be number one but many Emperors after him would also be up there as they technically Own their Empire‚Äôs wealth.,"So someone made some image and you spread it uncritically. SO Augustus as one fifth of Roman economy and $4.6 trillion. That puts the economy at $23 trillion. The population was maybe $70 million. That is just $330 thousand per person. Yeah sure. Lets take that John Jacob Astor with $20 million in 1848. An inflation calculator gives a multiplier of 32. That gives $640 million, not $110 billion.","Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt understand the need to adjust for inflation on historical figures. Inflation accounts for the rise of wealth among overall people. Caesar managed an empire of 1 million strong, the scale of your average Middle Eastern sheikh. The absolute value/output of his wealth is minuscule compared to the likes of Bezos today.",Any recent Emperor of China easily beat Caesar or any western Kong‚Äôs wealth. By recent I mean after 1500 especially in the late 1800s or even the last emperor of China.,What's funny that they have everyone in a suit. That's odd lol

All he has to do is follow their orders to the letter, and sooner or later, he‚Äôll get jacked. What a lot of people struggle with when pursuing a better physique is that they don‚Äôt know how exactly to get there, whether it‚Äôs doing the right exercises, or eating the right foods.

Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos‚Äô email still functioning?,"A personal story on this topic. In 2018 I was recognized randomly in a forth quarter All Hands meeting where my internal profile was shared with the all of the participants. To be clear, I was not recognized for anything in particular. This is something Jeff does at the end of every All Hands to highlight and celebrate employee passion. On our internal profile, employees can include a few sentences describing ‚ÄúWhat is your passion?‚Äù. Well, after this recognition, I wrote Jeff a thank you note - emailed to jeff@ - I included a picture from 2005 of he and I the last time he had come out to my building. To be clear, I don't know Jeff, I only met him once when he signed my 1999 Time magazine in 2005. On this day of recognition, I asked Jeff, who became the richest man in the world that week, if he & I could get an updated picture, it was also my 20 year work anniversary that year. I did not expect to get any response. I was so wrong! I got a reply from Jeff ‚Äî-38 minutes later‚Äî AND he included his executive assistant team to schedule time for a photo. Within 3 weeks I was standing in his office absolutely awestruck that the richest guy in the world gave me 5 minutes of his day.

Jeff Bezos,How can Jeff Bezos be in control of Amazon when he only owns 17% of it?,"Jeff Bezos owns Class A shares of Amazon, which means his vote against every share he holds is equivalent to that owned by any other shareholder. This is unlike Mark Zuckerberg's shares in Facebook, in which his vote per share accounts for 10 times that owned by other shareholders. Similar is the case with Google, in which the Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt trio owns 13 percent shares, while controlling more than 50 percent of the company, courtesy their disproportionate voting rights. Now we ask, why does Bezos control as much of Amazon as say, Page or Zuckerberg control Google and Facebook respectively? This is primarily because the company has been exceeding expectations under the leadership of Bezos. He is the man behind the transformation of the online retail company to a technology behemoth. The rise of Amazon Web Services is a result of his pet project. As long as investors' vision for the company is in alignment with that of Bezos of its still being in its Day One, they wouldn't mind having him keep the control. The share price of Amazon has scaled great heights in the past six years, and that's good enough to keep the investors bullish on the status quo. Moreover, his stake in the company might be less than 20 percent, its whopping value of $85 billion makes it a force to reckon with for minority share holders. Having said that, Bezos might start facing the heat the day the company foresees a wall. Investors, who are pretty glad relinquishing control today, will roar their heads when the growth rate starts staring an abyss. Till then, it is still Day One for Amazon and Bezos alike. ;)",https://www.quora.com/How-can-Jeff-Bezos-be-in-control-of-Amazon-when-he-only-owns-17-of-it,which is why he is steadily selling his stake and investing in blue origin.,"Exactly.

Swiss Chocolate,Desserts:  Where does the best dark chocolate come from?,"Tar pit of a question. There is no objective answer. Anyone claiming to give an authoritative response wants you to believe in them as an expert, subjugating your own judgment and experience. Try lots of chocolate, keep track of your reactions to the extent they're interesting or useful to you. Eat the stuff you like, avoid the stuff you don't. I was raised on crappy American milk chocolate. The taste of it still brings back wonderful memories. When I was two years old or so, one of my grandmothers gave me some chocolate, and then asked me if I wanted ""more."" I said yes, and for the next few years, I called chocolate ""more."" Today, a lot of American chocolate tastes like baby vomit to me. (And that doesn't contradict the above.) I tend to like German and Swiss chocolate over French, I have a strong negative reaction to acidic, under-conched chocolate, likewise over-conched  bland chocolate. There are some chocolates from Ecuador and Peru I like, as well as some from African beans. I've also tasted chocolate from Ecuador, Peru and Africa I won't eat again.

Swiss Chocolate,How much would an average for-export chocolate bar cost in Switzerland in the late 19th century (not including export costs)? How much is that roughly in today's Swiss francs? Or how much was it in the US dollars or the British pounds of that era?,"I can give a PARTIAL answer for 1914, and 2014. Das wurde aus 100 Franken in 100 Jahren | HZ writes that 100 Swiss Francs bought 47 kg of chocolate in 1914 and 13 kg of chocolate in 2014 I would like to add that for 2014, this is kind of optimistic, as only the CHEAPEST brands sold the 100 g bar for less than a Swiss Franc in 2014 (or today). So 10 kg is a more realistic measure (and this still ist kind of Germany-style third rate chocolate, not ‚Äútrue‚Äù Swiss one‚Ä¶) Interestingly, the devaluation of the Swiss Franc in these 100 years for potatoes (526 kg to 56 kg) and cheese (47 kg to 5 kg) was MORE than for chocolate, almost a factor of 10. ‚Äú90%‚Äù was an important measure in the journal article, which was published during a political campaign for partial re-institution of a gold-based Swiss Franc (which was REJECTED by about 77% of the population in a referendum). As the proponents of gold backing had said that the loss of value was 90%: they were close to the truth for cheese and potatoes, but not chocolate, here ‚Äúonly‚Äù about 80%.  Of course, even without giving the actual exchange rates, the Swiss Franc has markedly won in value compared to most other currencies, gold-backed or not. The reason is, of course, that ‚Äúwinning‚Äù wars by a narrow margin (and then losing an Empire‚Ä¶) is costly, and losing wars even more so. The Swiss, as we all know, did neither.",https://www.quora.com/How-much-would-an-average-for-export-chocolate-bar-cost-in-Switzerland-in-the-late-19th-century-not-including-export-costs-How-much-is-that-roughly-in-todays-Swiss-francs-Or-how-much-was-it-in-the-US-dollars-or-the,"Thank you for your answer, Wolfgang. What I‚Äôm trying to figure out is a scene in the Western movie ‚ÄúOpen Range,‚Äù where I‚Äôm certain the script writers got the pricing of the Swiss chocolate bars way off, which is a very common occurrence with amounts of money being mentioned in Hollywood period movies. I‚Äôm trying to establish a reasonable price range that we could expect a Swiss chocolate bar might have cost at that time, both for the product as well as all overseas and overland transporting it would have had to go through to get there. It is true that due to the California gold rush, San Francisco was prospering and booming greatly, and there was a large number of people who suddenly had so much money to throw around everywhere, that products were being imported from all over the world to be sold in stores there, and at that time Switzerland was exporting its chocolate bars all over the world, therefore yes, it is realistic that there would have been some Swiss chocolate bars available in San Francisco, though at quite an expensive price. The characters in this movie were in Montana, up along the northern border with Canada, which is a long ways from San Francisco, where imported products in the West would have come to port and been distributed from there. Though it‚Äôs starting to get less likely, I think it‚Äôs yet possible that some chocolate bars from Switzerland still could have succeeded at ending up even as far away as Montana‚Äîthough it probably would have been a poor marketing decision. We‚Äôre going to have to figure the price of transport, first overland from Switzerland to the European coast, probably France, then on a ship across the seas all the way around the world, around the southern tip of South America and up to San Francisco, then overland from San Francisco all the way to Montana, to the town they were in, which was but a new settlement and we can assume the people who were there wouldn‚Äôt have had huge amounts of money to throw around on luxuries like imported chocolate bars. But to figure this out, the first thing I wanted to start with was how much the chocolate bars would have sold for in Switzerland‚Äîand we have to do some converting because all countries‚Äô monetary units go through inflation after a century and a half and end up with a greatly decreased value that long a time later. I‚Äôm calculating that the US dollar at that time was worth about 25 US dollars today. So they go into the store and they buy three Cuban cigars‚Äîalso imported, but not from as far away‚Äîbesides two of their Swiss chocolate bars. Our protagonist asks the store clerk for the most expensive chocolate he has. He takes some out and replies, ‚ÄúThis is dark chocolate. It comes all the way from Switzerland, Europe. That‚Äôs near France, see.‚Äù When he totals up the price, for three Cuban cigars and two Swiss chocolate bars, it comes to five US dollars.  That would be US$125 in today‚Äôs money, CHF113.50 Swiss francs today, or EU‚Ç¨102.90. Just assuming that the cigars cost the same price as the chocolate bars, that would mean that each item cost, in today‚Äôs money, US$25, CHF22.70 or EU‚Ç¨20.60. Even though it‚Äôs true that the price of each cargo transport had to be added in, I still think the script writers didn‚Äôt calculate the final price anything close to accurately. I think they grossly overshot it because of today‚Äôs monetary values and they weren‚Äôt considering the monetary values in those days correctly. That‚Äôs what I think. Were people in that town going to be willing to spend the equivalent of 25 dollars for an imported chocolate bar? And therefore would it have been worth it even to have them there at all? To go to the trouble of getting them there when it seemed unlikely that anyone there would ever buy any to begin with? Well, let me be the one to wrangle with that. The information I was hoping you could help me with was how much, in the Swiss francs of that time‚Äîthe film was set in the year 1882‚Äîwe could expect a chocolate bar to have cost, and how much that would be equivalent to in the Swiss francs of today. From there I can convert it do dollars on x-rates.com I know there were (and are) different quality chocolate bars with different prices, but just to establish a reasonable range. Can you take a guess at how much one would have cost in Switzerland at that time and how much that would be in today‚Äôs money?",,,,
Swiss Chocolate,What should I not do in Switzerland?,"Here are some ‚ÄòDon't's from someone born and raised in the North of Switzerland:  Don't waste money on new water bottles.  Everything here is super expensive. But the water coming out of the many public fountains and bathrooms is usually extremely high quality. I recommend filling up an empty water bottle instead of buying a new one every time.  Don't assume we're speaking all national languages.  Most people from the French-speaking part won't be able to answer you in Italian, and I from the German-speaking part don't even know a single person who understands Romansh. Try approaching young adults in English, a lot of Swiss students learn it as their second language. Don't ever throw trash on the ground or in the water.  This should really be a no-brainer. If the damage to the environment argument doesn't convince you for some reason, know that it's frowned upon. Don't make noise after 10 pm if anyone can hear you.  Includes shutting of (car) doors, loud talking, watching telly and sometimes even flushing the toilet. Of course, clubs and bars are an exception. Don't be too loud in general.  I love those American ‚Äòreaction in cinema after Thanos snaps' videos on YouTube because Swiss cinemas are as quiet as a robber hiding behind a bush. We even talk pretty quietly on the train, in church or in a library. Adjust to the people around you to find the perfect volume. Don't be late.  The unspoken rule recommends always showing up a few minutes earlier. Even on public transport, some people like to stand up before it stops to leave the vehicle as quickly as possible. Don't forget to use ‚Äòthank you' and ‚Äòplease‚Äô.  It‚Äôs more of an expectation than extra friendliness. Don't go on a train or tram without a ticket.  You have to buy it beforehand, either at the station or online. If you get caught without a ticket you have to pay a fortune, trust me. But most buses allow you to buy tickets if you enter through the front door next to the driver. Don't assume it's always snowy and cold.  Good God, Swiss summers and autumns can be so hot. Don't plan your shopping trips on a Sunday.  You'll get restaurants and the little 24-hour shops at train stations. That's it. Everything else sleeps until Monday. Don't buy too much Swiss cheese before trying it.  I noticed that Swiss cheese can be pretty intense compared to the cheese in other countries. Make sure you like it. Don't use public transport with bicycles, dogs, or big luggage without informing yourself.  Sometimes you need to pay for an extra ticket. Don't compare German-speaking Swiss people to Germans.  If you know German and that makes you understand Swiss people well you‚Äôre either a linguistic genius or they try to talk without their natural strong Swiss dialect. Even if you still hear an accent. Don't go out in the snow without putting on sunscreen.  It might be cold but snow is like a huge mountain of tiny mirrors that are all throwing the sunlight into your face. Don't take a taxi if it's not absolutely necessary.  You think the reliable public transport system is expensive? Wait till you see your cab bill. Don't avoid supermarket chocolates.  If you want to take home some of the popular Swiss chocolates for your friends and relatives consider buying less known brands. They‚Äôre less expensive, can taste really good, and you might not see them ever again in your life. You don't necessarily need to visit Switzerland to get Toblerone. Have a wonderful vacation!

Swiss Chocolate,What foods should I try in Switzerland?," Image: R√∂sti via er... www.autocarhire.com Ged√∂rrtes Hundefleisch  [1,1a].   Ok , ok, So that may not be to everyones' literal or psychological taste.  Fine .  R√∂sti  is very common in the canton of my birth ( Bern ) and was a staple of my youth. It is a simple dish, but deceptively so: it makes for a near-perfect breakfast and without being  overly  parochial, there is much that can be added to elevate it above simple  Hash browns . My mother used to add bacon, onion and a range of herbs, just writing about it I can smell it.... Proper Swiss Cheese.  Of which there are over 450 kinds. The ""classical, like-in-the-cartoons, Swiss cheese"" is closest to  Emmental  (though the holes in Emmental can vary a lot in size). Anyway it is delicious. Especially with some  Paprika  on top. I personally like  Appenzeller  a whole lot also. Anyway with the 450 varieties to get through, you will be bound to find something you like! Swiss chocolate . I'm not much for chocolate to be honest, but when I do eat it, I tend to gravitate towards the Swiss kind. The term ""Swiss chocolate"" is jealously protected. If the product says that, it must have been made  in  Switzerland, not by Swiss nationals living abroad. Not on a piece of Swiss turf dug up and transported somewhere else, not while carrying a Swiss Army knife in one's pocket.  In  Switzerland means  in  Switzerland.
So what's the big deal about it? Well it is milk chocolate for a start, which personally I prefer to the more bitter American kind. Whole milk is generally used as well as cocoa butter (NB: not in cheaper kinds). This gives it a unique, creamy taste and texture. Please see here [2] for a few interesting facts concerning Swiss Chocolate manufacturers and here [3] for the citation for the ingredients.  Back (sort of) to cheese:  Fondue  is a Swiss dish of melted cheese, but I suspect most people have had it already, if you haven't, you should definitely try it when there. Check the link above for some amusing information considering its role in Swiss national identity.  Meringue  is also part of the Swiss tradition and is also one of my mother's dishes -  specifically a kind using hazelnut cream for the fillings - but ungrateful brat without a sweet tooth that I am (and it is seriously sweet) I can't really comment on the dish very much from a personal point of view. It certainly seems very popular though.  Finally I'm also a big big fan of  Chur meat pie  [4].

Jeff Bezos,What did Jeff Bezos do to set Amazon apart from all the other early dot-com companies?,"While ""long-term vision"" and ""big picture"" are both attributed to Amazon, the key was Jeff Bezos convincing Wall Street to buck historic trend and back Amazon. For >24 years. What else did Bezos do? Data-driven decisions. With a dose of good intuition: Price + selection + ease of purchase  (or ""convenience"" in Amazon lingo) would be paramount. Cheap is better than costly. Data driven decision making (which is why there was no TV advertising by Amazon for the longest time) meant that Bezos did not waste time or money on guesswork. In the age of 1990s dot com excess, Amazon differentiated itself by an unparalleled focus on frugality where it mattered, so they could spend big money on the bigger picture (legal, hiring, bolder and bigger decisions, technology (there was no cheap cloud computing then), and operations. Hiring the best: Jeff Bezos had the money and made a determined effort to hire the best from the early days. Everyone from rockstar coders and scientists to poached Walmart executives to fresh Harvard MBAs. Raising the bar: Every new hire had to ""raise the bar"" and be ""better"" than 50% of Amazonians. Amazon was constantly ""improving"". Frugality : Jeff Bezos knew from the get-go that although Amazon was a ""tech start-up"" it had a retail heart and soul. So he drove a beat up old Honda as a 1990s billionaire, and offered stock options instead of high salaries to compete with the Apples and Microsofts of the world. No free lunches as Amazon. At least, not after your interviews! Every dollar saved was one passed on to the customer.  At least that's what they told you.  focus on frugality led to smart decisions on the Seattle location (with access to the University of Washington talent, and proximity to book suppliers) instead of the ""hip"" but super-expensive Bay Area, picking books (boring, but a no-brainer owing to the nature of books as a product category) to start off with, the employee stock options strategy of dangling a 4-year carrot, and symbolic items such as ""door desks"". Being frugal means that Bezos still owns almost 80 million shares of AMZN stock. For reference the next highest shareholder  (Andy Jassy,  the CEO of Amazon Web Services and a long-term Amazonian   owns ""only"" 80 thousand. In other words: the man who led Amazon's efforts to become a leader in cloud computing while simultaneously creating and leading the most profitable division of Amazon (Amazon Web Services) has only  0.001  of Bezos' wealth.  Today. Jeff Bezos designed ruthlessly efficient leadership principles, management concepts and Amazonian values: ‚Äî2 pizza rule ‚Äî6 page narratives ‚ÄîThe PowerPoint ban ‚ÄîCollaboration is bad ‚ÄîAmazonian levels, organizational charts and tenures openly published ‚ÄîBring your dog to work (so you never have to go home) ‚Äîopenly stating he did not care what Wall Street thought. Wall Street ate up the ""big picture, long-term"" values that Amazon stood for - a key differentiator between Amazon and also-rans. Bezos also redesigned his principles carefully as his vision for Amazon changed: Jeff Bezos redesigned his leadership principles with 2 things in mind: Amazonian efficiency and a playbook of him remaining as hands-on as possible. In the early days, Amazonians worked long, hard or smart. ""Pick two out of three to be successful at Amazon"" Bezos said. In 1997, he had redesigned his words: ""You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon you  can't  choose two out of three,"" The two out of three had become three out of three. In  only  two or three years since Amazon's founding in 1994!",https://www.quora.com/What-did-Jeff-Bezos-do-to-set-Amazon-apart-from-all-the-other-early-dot-com-companies,"I highly doubt he made data-driven decisions at the early stage of the company. Like what he is sharing here:  Amazon's Jeff Bezos shares his secrets for life and business .
I think this is the major thing that sets him apart from all other biz leaders, including the fact that Amazon has the largest number of *unrelated* businesses it is going after, and many of them are firing on their own cylinders (for example, B2B E-commerce, Amazon Studio, last-mile delivery, etc). Next decade would be a push into Financial Services (Fintech, most likely) and Insurance, I think:)",,,,

Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos a megalomaniac?,"Even used colloquially the term easily applies at first glance with much that appears to confirm it on second, third & further glances. Amazon engineers publicly commenting don‚Äôt necessarily disagree. See comment to my answer below from one. > Can you think Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk are good people and still be critical of them? Extremely typical & in accordance with most people‚Äôs accurate perception of megalomania a few quotes only from The New Yorker article on Bezos: The company had amassed more than a year‚Äôs worth of inventory. ‚ÄúThat was terrifying, because it meant we could totally lose control of our brand,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat if Amazon decides to start selling the shoes for ninety-nine cents, or to give them away with Prime membership, or do a buy-one-get-one-free campaign? It would completely destroy how people see our shoes, and our only power to prevent something like that is to cut off a retailer‚Äôs supply‚Ä¶. At the Birkenstock Americas office, in Marin County, California, he and his deputies would spend hours preparing arguments about why stopping unauthorized sellers would help Amazon‚Äôs customers, and then they‚Äôd crowd around Kahan‚Äôs desk and turn on the speakerphone. Sometimes the Amazon executives would let them go on; other times, they‚Äôd cut them off midsentence. It wasn‚Äôt Amazon‚Äôs place to decide who could and couldn‚Äôt sell on the site, the executives explained, as long as simple guidelines were met. ‚ÄúThey basically didn‚Äôt care‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just one company, and there‚Äôs millions of companies they deal with every day‚Ä¶. Amazon is the shopping mall now, and, normally, if you open a store in a shopping mall, you can expect certain things‚Äîlike the mall operator will clean the hallways, and they‚Äôll make sure Foot Locker isn‚Äôt right next door to Payless, and if someone sets up a kiosk in front of your store and starts selling fake Air Jordans, they‚Äôll kick them off the property.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúBut Amazon is the Wild West. There‚Äôs hardly any rules, except everyone has to pay Amazon a percentage, and you have to swallow what they give you and you can‚Äôt complain. Hundreds of other companies have told Amazon about counterfeiting or what they see as unfair competition‚Äîsome of it generated by Amazon itself. Williams-Sonoma filed a lawsuit claiming that ‚ÄúAmazon has unfairly and deceptively engaged in a widespread campaign of copying.‚Äù Earlier this year, a judge denied Amazon‚Äôs motion to dismiss the case, ruling that the company might be ‚Äúcultivating the incorrect impression‚Äù that ersatz products were authorized by Williams-Sonoma. Critics say that Amazon uses the torrent of data it collects each day‚Äîhow long a customer‚Äôs cursor hovers over various products, how much of a price drop triggers a purchase‚Äîto divine which products are poised to become blockbusters, and then copies them. In July, the E.U.  announced  an investigation into whether Amazon uses ‚Äúsensitive data from independent retailers who sell on its marketplace‚Äù to unfairly promote its own goods, or to create imitation products. Europe‚Äôs top competition regulator,  Margrethe Vestager , told me that Amazon is ‚Äúhosting thousands and thousands of smaller businesses, but at the same time it is a competitor to them.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúThis deserves  much  more scrutiny‚Ä¶. Birkenstock, eventually decided to take extreme measures. He announced that his firm would no longer sell shoes on Amazon, and he sent a letter to retailers declaring that if they listed Birkenstock products on Amazon they would be ‚Äúsevering‚Äù their ‚Äúrelationship with our company‚Ä¶. the site remains full of dubious products. A  recent investigation  by the  Wall Street Journal  identified thousands of products for sale on Amazon that ‚Äúhave been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators,‚Äù including children‚Äôs toys containing dangerous levels of lead. Many of these products were shipped from Amazon warehouses, some through the Fulfillment by Amazon program. And Birkenstock‚Äôs customer-service department still gets calls from customers who bought fake sandals on Amazon and expect Birkenstock to provide a refund‚Ä¶. When there‚Äôs only one marketplace, and it‚Äôs impossible to walk away, everything is out of balance. Amazon owns the marketplace. They can do whatever they want. That‚Äôs not capitalism. That‚Äôs piracy.‚Äù Bezos had plenty of enemies, and not just aggrieved companies like Birkenstock. For years, he had been battling various groups, from pro-union organizers to activists critical of Amazon‚Äôs tax practices, and some of the clashes had been nasty. Labor organizers had been a particular source of conflict. In 2000, when the Communication Workers of America tried to unionize four hundred of Amazon‚Äôs customer-service representatives in Seattle, the company closed down the call center where those employees worked‚Ä¶. In 2018, when Seattle‚Äôs city council, facing a homelessness crisis, unanimously passed a measure that would have required the city‚Äôs largest companies to pay a tax of two hundred and seventy-five dollars per local worker to build homeless shelters and affordable housing, Amazon balked. The law would have initially cost Amazon less than twenty million dollars per year, at a time when its annual revenue exceeded two hundred and thirty billion dollars. Before it passed, Amazon announced that it had halted construction on a new tower in Seattle and was reconsidering an expansion into seven hundred thousand square feet that it had leased‚Ä¶ Activists have also noted that Bezos is much less philanthropic than many of his peers. Among America‚Äôs top five billionaires, he is the only one who has not signed the Giving Pledge‚Äîa program, created by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, that encourages the world‚Äôs wealthiest citizens to give away at least half their wealth. Amazon, meanwhile, has drawn particular criticism for its approach to federal taxes. Financial filings show that Amazon likely paid no U.S. federal income tax in 2018. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt think companies have obligations to employees beyond paying wages while they work.‚Äù Bezos‚Äôs close acquaintance agrees: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an empathy gap there, something that makes it hard for him to see his obligations to other people‚Ä¶ A growing number of regulators in Washington, D.C., and in Europe argue that Amazon, along with other tech giants, needs to be reined in‚Ä¶ According to Amazon insiders, Bezos adamantly refuses to consider slowing the company‚Äôs growth, fearing that its culture will break down if the pace slackens. He is determined to defend his creation aggressively‚Ä¶ Amazon offered few specifics on its lobbying activities.‚Äù Is Amazon Unstoppable? The Wikipedia entry scratches the surface but covers international working conditions, animal cruelty, noncompetitive working practices & more. > Criticism of Amazon - Wikipedia",https://www.quora.com/Is-Jeff-Bezos-a-megalomaniac,"I felt much the way you do, until I saw that Blue Moon announcement contained in a recent Frontline News documentary. Despite all the criticism of Amazon and Bezos in that doc, Bezos‚Äô quote from high school next to that dream project may have changed my mind‚Ä¶ Gates was driven‚Ä¶ Gates and Buffet didn‚Äôt do their wealth giveaway in the prime of their life‚Ä¶ Bezos is hardly done ‚Äúcreating,‚Äù yet. Is he driven? Does the ‚Äúgame‚Äù keep him up at night because being first is the most important thing to him in the world?

You want him taken down a notch? OUTLAW BUYING FROM companies that sell goods that are manufactured outside this country, unless the manufacturing involves global marketplace considerations for pollution or the expiration of natural sources for making those goods.

Just a couple thoughts. Thank you for your answer.",The great silent film ‚Äúmetropolis‚Äù has an opening scene where the depressed workers seem to have no hope.

Chip Shortage,Is Hyundai tackling the semiconductor computer chip shortage by making its own computer chips?,"No. Currently it‚Äôs not, at least by now. I'm Korean, but I first noticed this move when Mr. Bluestein asked a question. In short, because there are so many variables, it is difficult to conclude whether the move is simply a response to the current semiconductor supply shortage or a broader one. Looks like we need to watch some more. For reference, the Hyundai Conglomerates, which is now divided into three or four, to which Hyundai Motor belonged, was originally founder and owner of SK Hynix, the world's second largest DRAM maker and one of major producers of flash memory. (When Korea fell into the financial crisis in 1997, Hyundai Semiconductor acquired LG Semiconductor and Hynix was made, but at that time, the semiconductor economy was bad and sold to a consortium of Korean banks.) Hyundai Mobis is a kind of in-house parts supplier and carries out various cutting-edge research as a a proxy of Hyundai Motors. Semiconductor-related manpower is easily available for Hyundai Mobis because Samsung Semiconductor employees who want to move from the very tight environment of Samsung Semiconductor to a more spacious environment exist just 20 kilometers away, and a considerable number(<-arguable) of workers have already moved. In addition, Tesla is leading a disruptive innovation in the automotive industry by reducing the number of ECUs for high-end vehicles from 100 to three in recent years. For the innovation, designing their own ECU was crucial and from that TESLA was able to reduce relying on ECU and related makers in big scale. Dongbu HiTek, which Hyundai Mobis is seeking cooperation with (according to articles), has recently been in poor financial condition and is rumored to be sold, but the US seems to press South Korean Govt. holds back. The same is true for MagnaChip. However, since the holding-back state cannot be maintained, the Korean government may be encouraging Hyundai to take over.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Hyundai-tackling-the-semiconductor-computer-chip-shortage-by-making-its-own-computer-chips,,,,,

Chip Shortage,"Why is the world facing a chip shortage, and why can't companies just manufacture more to meet the demand?","‚ÄúJust manufacture more‚Äù? How? Building more factories? Do you know how much investment that would need? And how long it would take to build them? Then after it‚Äôs built ‚Ä¶ will the same level of demand for those chips still continue for several years afterwards? If not, then you‚Äôve just invested in a hugely expensive building + equipment to then not get any income from it. Few people realize just how strong the demand/supply factors in economics are. When demand skyrockets like it did over last year, factories can‚Äôt simply ‚Äúbuild more‚Äù. They need to expand to meet such demand. And that takes a lot of time and money. Instead, they increase the sell price to try and make larger profits - which (if the demand lasts for a long time) gives them a capital buffer which they can then use to increase their production facilities.  Even worse, a high technology like semi-conductor integrated circuits, is not just one single company. It‚Äôs an entire supply chain from mines through refining, design, fabrication, assembly, and finally retail. And in between each of those the glue is the transport of each of these intermediate parts as well. All put together needs to be increased in order to keep supplies ever expanding. Meaning all the companies have to match one another‚Äôs increased production. Even just one not doing it affects every one following it in that chain, but even those behind it have no-where to send their increased production. Things like this do not fix themselves quickly. It takes years, sometimes decades, before production starts to meet demands. The only stuff which can adjust reasonably quickly is pricing. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening now.  Yes, it‚Äôs also not the only thing adjusting prices. But the others are more like ancillary factors making it all worse. The major cause of unavailability and high prices is the increased demand. More people suddenly needed / wanted desktops and laptops, where previously they were fine with their cell phone and perhaps an office machine. More are jumping on the crypto mining craze (again). Several are trying to find something for entertainment, and looking for a gaming machine. Others are looking for alternative means of income, and seeing if they can‚Äôt do something like stream video / produce some electronic service / product to sell. Every one of these are contributing to increased demand. It‚Äôs not the first time. It isn‚Äôt even as if such changes in demand stop. It‚Äôs just that it occurred so suddenly and so widespread (globally) all at once that it completely flooded the market. When a market is used to selling some half a billion devices a year, and then suddenly see an extra billion (just 1 out of 7 people in the world) want a new device within a month ‚Ä¶ things are going to go badly. Then these suppliers also ask themselves: Is this demand going to last? Should we invest in making more products? Or will this ‚Äúcraze‚Äù end in a year or two? Meanwhile, can‚Äôt we just increase our sales price and make extra profits while we wait to see if this is an anomaly?  When will supply start to climb up to demand? Only once those suppliers feel that the demand is a long term trend, not some short term knee-jerk from a global pandemic. When will prices start going back to pre-inflated levels? Either if that supply quantity increases sufficiently - perhaps several years from now. Or more likely, demand will plateau and drop till the current supplies can again easily match the demands.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-world-facing-a-chip-shortage-and-why-cant-companies-just-manufacture-more-to-meet-the-demand,,,,,

Swiss Chocolate,What are the most interesting things that have happened on an airplane?,"This happened while I was on a trip to Germany once. The air-hostess was going around giving a chocolate bar to little kids in the flight. Now this wasn't your ordinary Hershey bar. It was pretty good quality Swiss chocolate. There were 2 guys sitting nearby, somewhere in their 20's. Their eyes perked up when they saw the chocolates. One of them called up the air-hostess and clarified if they were free. Satisfied that they were, he then asked for a chocolate. Then insisted for some more. Well, all this isn't very unusual. But then once the air-hostess had distributed the chocolates and gone back to the curtained area taking the big bowl of chocolates with her, one of the guys got up. A minute later, he emerged from the curtains, both his hands grappling a bunch of chocolates. His friend opens up his bag, and they stuff it in. Next, his friend goes inside, and does the same. This trip from their seat to the chocolate zone happened 2-3 times, till eventually one of them came out grinning, with the chocolates, and laughed, ""We finished the whole bowl."", and they hi-five. ""Nothing left for the others."" the other said, and they laughed again. Everyone was watching them intently, but they were oblivious. They spent the next one hour eating all of the chocolates with broad victorious smiles on their faces, and calling the air-hostess time to time to clear up the trash.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-things-that-have-happened-on-an-airplane,"Today, that could be seen as a terrorist act, and the chocolate grabbers tied up with duct tape....","Fiends!

Swiss Chocolate,Could the U.S. invade Switzerland?,"A better method than full-on, bare-metal invasion would be to make Switzerland suffer heavy economic loss.  This of course means siphoning off all the chocolate produced in Switzerland. Obviously, the only way this could be seen as beneficial is if the U.S. faced a staggering loss of her own chocolate production.  Of course this would probably be at the hands of terrorists. In which case, the invasion of Switzerland would be an absolute necessity - but we would have to keep Swiss chocolate production intact. The strategic means for doing this would be complicated;  A full infiltration of Chocosuisse would have to be made by U.S. Special forces.  This would require the U.S. military to have intense training in proper chocolate tempering, forming, and chopping.  The costs would be staggering to the U.S. military budget.  Specifically all the extra PT that Special forces would have to take to work off all those extra pounds from learning proper chocolate preparation.

 Next, after infiltration into the country's largest export, a mechanism of stabilizing (and controlling) Swiss chocolate prices would have to be implemented.  This would require complicity with both the implanted puppet-government, and the puppet chocolatesuisse.
 After these events take place, The U.S. would then have to confabulate to the rest of the world that Swiss chocolate (and Switzerland) are free and independent economic entities - This would mean construction of economic policies that  would be beneficial to all of Switzerland's major chocolate markets.  To wit;
   But note:  Installing a puppet government in Switzerland would be difficult, but it's not like the U.S. hasn't done this before;   However it would take some time and require possibly a world-war.  But we all know that the stakes are high;  What is the United States without chocolate?   is it even worth defending without chocolate?",https://www.quora.com/Could-the-U-S-invade-Switzerland,"Technically we could just buy control of Nestle for far less than the invasion would cost.  If it was a chocolate crisis driving this, the Belgians (Northwest of Switzerland, much easier to invade as everyone since the Romans have shown)  make the best chocolate flavorings/liquors I'm told by gourmet chocolate makers.  And of course capturing the cacao beans fields, mostly in Latin America and originally Mexican-based would matter more since the Swiss just process  some of the world's chocolate (like seizing an oil refinery and ignoring the oil wells.)",,,,

We cannot expect a small country like Sweden or Australia to be able to complete on the basis of sheer volume of research. But if you normalize for population, a slightly different picture emerges.

""There are a couple of very big IDMs at the moment,"" Alan Priestley, Europe semiconductor analyst at Gartner, tells ZDNet. ""But most of the industry relies on the use of foundries, and the reason this has happened is because it is massively expensive to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities."" Intel is an exception, says Priestley: through continuous investment, the company has managed to establish itself as a major chip designer and manufacturer. But for the majority of businesses, it is still necessary to delegate semiconductor manufacturing to external foundries. Foundries take on the front-end aspect of the chip-manufacturing process. Based on different chip designs, nanometer-scale integrated circuits are printed onto silicon wafers; the wafers are then sent to the next stage of production, where they are sliced into individual finished semiconductors, before being assembled and packaged into electronic devices, and tested. There are up to 1,400 steps in the overall manufacturing process for semiconductor wafers; it can take as long as 20 weeks to complete advanced chips, and fabs can use as many as 300 different types of materials throughout fabrication. ""It's almost impossible to start chip manufacturing from scratch,"" says Priestley. ""This is why we are seeing industry consolidation: it has become so difficult and expensive to do, that companies just couldn't afford to do it on their own.""",https://www.quora.com/If-insufficient-silicon-caused-the-current-chip-shortage-why-cant-silicon-production-be-ramped-up-to-meet-the-demand,,,,,
Chip Shortage,How long is the computer chip shortage that‚Äôs affected so many industries expected to last?,"Please check around and see if you can find any shutdown car production lines. Then check to see whether there are laptop models you can‚Äôt buy. I think the shortage is mostly over. There is likely a desire on the part of many users of ICs to have more inventory. Perhaps not every model of laptop is available. But I think that in 6‚Äì9 months the IC manufacturers have had time to get all the factories back to full production. It is a tough, expensive business. There is not enough capacity in the 7nm and below technology nodes and none of it is in the US. So there is a lot of babble about the strategic issues. These are important. Intel and TSMC are planning several fabs in the US to be built over the next few years. So the high end will get taken care of. I will just mention that this has happened before in certain kinds of chips and double ordering was always part of the equation.",https://www.quora.com/How-long-is-the-computer-chip-shortage-that-s-affected-so-many-industries-expected-to-last,,,,,

They make many changes to their vehicles throughout the year. Though you can find when you buy a used Tesla, it may be a 2017, but that only means it was built in 2017.

Chip Shortage,Which company is responsible for chip shortage?,"There is no ONE company that is responsible for the chip shortage. The shortage is a much more complex condition than that and is a mix of several factors. The pandemic has made supply chains and production of raw ingredients/resources needed to make chips slow down. i.e. there is less supply of the prerequisites needed to make chips. Including silicon. Big chip Fabs (manufacturers) particularly TSMC is cranking out chips from more customers than ever, Apple being the biggest and demanding a huge amount of production bandwidth. TSMC also services other major chip makers like AMD and Nvidia so having them try to supply the entire world market with all these chips is a daunting task. Keep in mind, Apple used to use Intel chips and that was when Intel was under full production and able to manufacture all their own chips which is not the case now. So some of Intel‚Äôs manufacture demand is now falling on other companies. The demand for chips is higher now due to the pandemic and the sheer number of people working from home and playing games etc.. So the higher demand creates a relatively higher perceived shortage. Due to the increased sense of scarcity created by higher demand and the lower supply, scalpers have gone rampant and are buying what supply there is in droves which creates even greater perceived shortage than reality. These scalpers are re-selling their supplies on sites like ebay and Amazon for outrageous prices which makes what actual supply there is seem out of reach for most people. Take all the above in various amounts and mixtures in different regions and you get the current ‚Äúchip shortage‚Äù.",https://www.quora.com/Which-company-is-responsible-for-chip-shortage,,,,,

Chip Shortage,Is it legal for car dealers to add thousands of dollars to the sticker price of a new car because of the chip shortage?,"As a general rule, in the United States, most dealers of most things can charge pretty much whatever they want. There are some few exceptions, but they‚Äôre rare. The control on this is that you don‚Äôt have to buy from them if you don‚Äôt want to. Find another dealer and ask if they can make you a better offer. If none of them will or can, then either they‚Äôre all colluding on price (which is illegal), or their costs are legitimately high enough that they can‚Äôt make a profit selling for less. Now, I don‚Äôt doubt that some dealers are taking advantage of the current shortage to kick up prices, but the chip shortage is real, and simple supply and demand dictates that the price is going to go up until the supply can normalize.

Swiss Chocolate,What is the best Swiss chocolate?,"I am swiss and tried a lot of the chocolate that you can buy here. My personal favorite is the brand Lindt, from which I like the truffes, the pralines and the famous Lindor Kugeln, which are essentially filled round praline that come in various flavours, from the classic red one which is milk chocolate to more special ones like marc de champagne (which would be the white gold one I believe). Now, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people mention Cailler. I personally strongly disagree with that, I find Cailler chocolate generally way too sweet and lacking the ‚Äúdepth‚Äù of taste that for example the Lindt chocolate has. The only chocolate I like from that brand is the ‚ÄúAtelier‚Äù line. It seems to be made with a lot more care and the other chocolate bars they have to offer. Another widely liked and very traditional brand of chocolate would be Frey. I think their chocolate isfine, nothing special, but because of the tradition it still sells decently. For example, my grandparents still gift me a box from Frey every christmas. I actually like their chocolate bars better than the boxes, but oh well. :D Then there‚Äôs maestrani, Ragusa and Camille Bloch. The reason I mention these together is that they all are famous for some specific products instead of just generallymaking great chocolate. For maestrani I‚Äôd say the Minor chocolate bars are the product everybody knows here. I really like those, I remember eating the mini minors for my afternoon snack (or as we call it, z‚Äôvieri, which could translate to ‚Äòat four‚Äô, beacause of the time you eat it, when a lot of children come home from school and workers take a short afternoon break) often. Ragusa also has some special chocolate bars, which are just called Ragusa (haha, very original, I know). I like the newer ‚Äòblond‚Äô version best of that brand, taste kinda like caramel and white chocolate with nuts, very delicious. About Camille Bloch I honestly don‚Äôt really know anything, I just remember that one TV ad with a lady. It was made like it was thought for a perfume‚Ä¶ anyway‚Ä¶ Then, there‚Äôs the holy grail of chocolate: L√§derach. It is a very famous store, and you can‚Äôt buy the chocolate from there in in a normal grocery store. Which I by the way recommend going to (very common ones are Coop or Migros), because you can buy a lot of the brands I mentioned there and also some good cheaper chocolate. My father for example always buys the white Tourist chocolate, which has nuts and raisins in it. Not my favorite, but not exactly bad either. Back to L√§derach though. Swiss people, myself included, are most likely to buy chocolate from there or from a Lindt factory store if they are going to gift someone chocolate. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs handmade, comes in nice boxes and tastes amazing. Also, it‚Äôs more expensive. The pralines and the Bruchschokolade (‚Ä¶ broken chocolate ‚Ä¶? Idk how to translate this. It just means that you can chose a flavor (e.g. strawberry yoghurt or caramelized nuts) and a quantity, like 100g, and the will break of that quantity of a larger piece of chocolate. It‚Äôs just kind of ‚Äòfresher‚Äô chocolate, and it‚Äôs fun seeing them do it for you. Kind of like a cheese counter in a grocery store.) are just HEAVEN. I bought my father a little box of Kirschst√§ngeli (Cherry Sticks; Chocolate Sticks filled with cherry liquor (‚ÄòKirsch‚Äô) and dusted with cocoa powder) from there for christmas because I know he loves them. So, that‚Äôs my two cents on chocolate in Switzerland. Let me just tell you that this is entirely my experience and my tastes. Don‚Äôt limit yourself when it comes to chocolate. It‚Äôs like sex, just try everything that you think you might like. There are soooo many flavors you can choose from, so don‚Äôt be shy!

Chip Shortage,"Why is there a computer chip shortage, and will it be solved soon?","The shortage in chips within every electronic device in the world, has been steadily worsening since last year (2020) Initially the problem was only a temporary delay in supplies as factories shut down when the coronavirus pandemic first hit. However, although production is back to normal, a new surge in demand driven by changing habits fueled by the pandemic means that it is now reaching crisis point. Car manufacturers investing in tech-heavy electric vehicles, the boom in sales of TVs and home computers and launch of new games consoles and 5G-enabled mobile phones have all driven demand. Even the mighty Apple, a $2tn company and the world‚Äôs biggest buyer of semiconductors spending $58bn annually, was  forced to delay the launch of the much-hyped iPhone 12  by two months last year due to the shortage. The reality is that there are some pretty big factors at play: Covid-19 ‚Ä¶ Need I say more? Silicon shortages and inability to feed the required supply chains of semi-conductor manufacturers. High carry over supply and demand from temporarily delayed production or even in some cases total shutdown of manufacturing operations and shipping hubs. Will it be solved soon?

Chip Shortage,TSMC in Taiwan controls 30% of the semiconductor industry. GM is idling factories because of chip shortages. What would the impact be to the world economy if mainland China invades Taiwan?,"Most of automobile-related chips are not manufactured in TSMC. TSMC is one of only THREE top-tier chip manufacturers in the world. Out of the three top-tier chip manufacturer, Intel only produce their own products. So, the manufacturing capacity of TSMC is rather limited. They tend to only take order from making the most sophisticated products simply because it has a much higher profit margins. Examples of sophisticated products that requires TSMC to manufacture are: AMD CPUs Nvidia GPUs Qualcom CPUs inside your Android phones various processors designed by Apple used in iPad, iPhone, MacBook, or Apple watches etc. If you look at the short list above, you will discover that ‚Äúsophisticated products‚Äù are either extremely powerful, or it is extremely powerful AND it has to be extremely power-efficient (think of CPUs in your phone). TSMC ‚Äúonly‚Äù make those. Computer chips in your washing machine, microwave oven, USB charger, on the other hand, tend to have much lower technical requirement  to make them  and the vast majority of these chips are made by factories that you‚Äôve never heard of. In other word, there is a sort of pecking order in those semiconductor manufacturing facilities. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are way on the top (and yes, there are only three first-tier in the world). The nasty market dynamics is that these three tend to make the vast majority of the profit in the industry. The rest of the semiconductor factories are running on extremely LOW margins. Just to give you an idea how lopsided this industry is:  As of 2019, there are 17 public traded semiconductor companies in Taiwan, in which TSMC alone constitute  49%+  of revenue and  77%+  of profit!  Many of these companies have profit margin on par with growing potatoes and onions (and I am not exaggerating)‚Ä¶ The only difference is that you don‚Äôt need tens of millions of investment upfront to grow potatoes. (Those who loves to accuse Chinese stolen American jobs‚Ä¶ do you still want those job back now?) Computer chips for automobiles and industrial use falls in the ‚Äúnot-so-sophisticated‚Äù category and the profit margin along with it‚Ä¶ with a twist. In other word, chips used in automobiles market is also have a low-profit margins. The twist is that chips used in industrial and automobile settings need the chips to be ruggedized for the harsh environment the chips operate in (e.g. under a car‚Äôs hood). In addition, many of industry-specific chips have additional industry-specific requirements / certification process which the factory need to adhere to. The combination of low-volume (e.g. number of cars sold vs number of mobile phone sold), low-profit, and specialized requirements are reasons why  more than 40% of automobile chips are made by  companies that already has a division specialized for the automobile industry and making these chips in house:  NXP, STMicro, Renesas, and Infineon . It is also the reason why most 3rd party-manufacturing companies prefer doing something else than spend the effort trying to crack the automotive market. TSMC has put SOME emphasis on automobile-related product production, with 27% increase in production volume compare with last year. But overall,  TSMC‚Äôs automobile-product output constitute about  3%  of their total production  (and 4% of revenue) in 2020.  If you‚Äôve paid attention to the computer gaming world lately, you will notice that there is a massive shortage in the latest AMD CPUs, the latest Graphic Cards from Nvidia and AMD, even Sony PlayStation couldn‚Äôt keep up with the demand‚Ä¶ (And I have not mentioned those cryptocurrency miners) Computer chips in THESE items require a much more sophisticated manufacturing technology and more importantly, commands a much more lucrative profit for TSMC. If TSMC already having problems to meet their demand on their high-end, profitable items, why should they switch their limited manufacturing capacity to a much lower profit margin product? In other word, GM‚Äôs idle has very little to do with TSMC. Does TSMC have the capability to levitate the production shortage? Yes. Does it make business sense for TSMC to do so? Most likely not. GlobalFoundries, on the other hand, is one ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù (headquartered in the US, owned by bunch of Muslims) manufacturing company that actually make a lot of automobile-related chips in the past. Maybe you should ask them why can‚Äôt they ramp up the production to satisfy GM‚Äôs need. If it comes to mainland China invading Taiwan, we will have a lot to worry about other than the ‚Äúeconomic impact.‚Äù Rather GM can continue to make cars is probably the least of your concern by then.",https://www.quora.com/TSMC-in-Taiwan-controls-30-of-the-semiconductor-industry-GM-is-idling-factories-because-of-chip-shortages-What-would-the-impact-be-to-the-world-economy-if-mainland-China-invades-Taiwan,"Thanks for the answer, but GM is only one symptom of the chip shortage. Have you tried purchasing a PS5 or Xbox Series X? They sell out within seconds due to the chip shortage. Newegg, a large online retailer of computer components has resorted to a raffle to allow buyers the opportunity to purchase a CPU or GPU. PC manufacturers are selling PCs without graphics cards because none are available. The supply chain for semiconductors is extremely fragile, and prone to disruption. The drought in Taiwan. The sudden switch to working from home caused by the pandemic. Even container shortages all play a role in this. Now imagine a situation where the mainland uses force against Taiwan. Even if the US government does not respond militarily (I don‚Äôt see how it can at this time), the disruption to the semiconductor supply chain would be a disaster, even if China worked to ameliorate it in the short term (it‚Äôs in China‚Äôs best interest to control it long term, just as it was in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs interest to control the flow of oil starting in the 1950s).

Chip Shortage,Are the United States auto part makers bracing for a bumpy ride as the global semiconductor chip shortage intensifies to unprecedented levels never seen before?,"Most probably the automotive industry faces a bumpy road ahead. The Covid-19 driven surge in demand in electronic devices has led to a global semiconductor shortage. As margins on auto chips are lower than those on semiconductors for electronics, auto makers come last in the queues. However, people have bought and upgraded their electronics and the demand curve is flattening. With this development on the demand side some kind of relaxation of the situation can be expected in the second half of 2021. As semiconductor value chain networks require high investment in the range of billions of dollars, and as chip production equipment makers have backlogs too it may well take another year till mid of 2022 before the situation is largely resolved.",https://www.quora.com/Are-the-United-States-auto-part-makers-bracing-for-a-bumpy-ride-as-the-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-intensifies-to-unprecedented-levels-never-seen-before,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,What are Jeff Bezos' strengths as a CEO?,"Amazon was just four years old at the time, but it already had $1 billion in annual sales only two years after registering just $60 million. The talk is a bit meandering ‚Äî there‚Äôs a demo that takes a while to work, and Bezos more than once giddily recites anecdotes that end with sex-related punchlines ‚Äî but it‚Äôs full of the kind of statements about how Amazon would stand out that convince you that this monstrosity of a business was in no way an accident. If you‚Äôre an entrepreneur building a company, or simply interested in how one of the world‚Äôs most successful CEOs thinks about guiding a business, you should really just watch the whole 50-minute video.

Jeff Bezos,What do you think about Jeff Bezos announcing he will fly into space next month?,"This is a way to show he thinks that it is safe to fly on his rocket. He may even think it is but inherently a rocket is a bomb waiting to explode. This architecture is a risk in itself as the capsule has his own propulsion system. Furthermore, I can understand why people would want to spend their wedding trip in a space station during one week but I have difficulties when we speak about 5 minutes in space. In the beginning many people would want to fly in space for 5 minutes but after it is no longer a novelty it will pass. There will be also mounting competition with Starship which will be far better in comparison. In other words, if I were rich I would love to stay some time in space and would be ready to take some risks even if I have to pay 500 000 $ or more but same doesn‚Äôt apply for five minute at the border of space. As we say in France, the elephant has given birth to a mouse which I believe will be short lived. Note that I didn‚Äôt say Blue Origin was dead because Jeff Bezos is not stupid. He has secured BE4 engines sale to ULA. I do believe as well that he is working on his own answer to Starship and that it is one of the reason of New Glenn delay. We may have some surprises later on.",https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Jeff-Bezos-announcing-he-will-fly-into-space-next-month,"SpaceX will now send you to orbit for about $50 million. Axion is booking flights and has booked several. Tourists in orbit will be routine very shortly. But for $50M per seat. Far more people can afford the 5-minute trip as it costs only 1% as much. yes, 1% as much. that is kind of a big deal. Over time space flight will be much cheaper But in time I will be dead. Many 50-year-olds can‚Äôt wait 50 years. This can be done now. Even Elon Musk said he hopes to go to Mars in his lifetime, He is still in his 40s. So people try to do what they can now rather then waiting","‚Ä¶ inherently a rocket is a bomb waiting to explode. A very valid observation but along the same lines that using explosives to blast rock or collapse buildings is a hazardous profession. I think Blue Origin and fellow rocket companies have shown that these ‚Äúbombs‚Äù will not explode but rather will burn ferociously under controlled conditions and only when desired. The procedures and safety designed into these ‚Äúbombs‚Äù has gotten to the point where taking off in one is not really hazardous. Early airplanes were really hazardous but by the time the barnstormer came through your town, it was statistically not as dangerous as one might have thought.",,,

Shaw, enough so that he invited them to parties at his small apartment in Manhattan. I went to one. Jeff, everyone, was friendly, mild, not much different than the people I knew at Stanford, other than being a little older. Jeff had auburn hair and showed us a funny hat that matched his hair. I had a nice time. He didn't have an odd laugh. I think Jeff had managerial responsibilities at D.E. Shaw.

Jeff Bezos,Why are Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk competing in space rather than working together?,"Because ultimately they have different goals for going to space. Elon's goal has always been colonizing Mars, whereas Bezos (much like Branson) is more financially driven. Now, while both are completely valid reasons for going to space, they make for two completely different approaches. If your goals are financial, the common logic of business will guide you towards something that can prove the capability/solution as fast as possible while still generating revenue - The easiest solution? Space tourism. No time consuming contract negotiations, no need for orbital capabilities etc. Sure, on the flip side, you have higher safety requirements that you need to burn money on but that is the trade-off you have to make. If your goal is colonizing Mars, the sub-orbital capability does quite literally nothing for you - what you need is fast, cheap and reliable way to put stuff into high orbit/deep space, which is orders of magnitudes harder and more expensive. So expensive in fact that you will risk losing everything in process (with probabilities greatly leaning towards losing everything), which is one of the ace cards Elon had when he started SpaceX - he had just sold his previous company for hefty sum so he had money to burn and no companies/employees/etc. that he would risk in the process which makes the decision easier (sure, later on he did risk everything AND Tesla but he was committed at that point already). Bezos and/or Branson would have to risk everything to compete at the same level which would include their current portfolio of companies, and I don't think that's an decision that is easily made.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Jeff-Bezos-and-Elon-Musk-competing-in-space-rather-than-working-together,"Sort of. Bezos is worth 6X as much as Elon Musk, so could afford to directly compete any way he wanted. OTOH Musk is worth about 6X as much as Branson. Branson really isn‚Äôt in the same League. He‚Äôs not an engineer and he‚Äôs only worth a small fraction as much. By comparison he‚Äôs just playing around at it for publicity value to his other Virgin brands.","This answer doesn't really explain their motivations. Musk has already made a very profitable business from the existing space establishment through both commercial and government business, while the market for space tourism is entirely unproven at this time, and little infrastructure exists for it yet. If Bezos' aim is to make a sustainable business then he is already far behind SpaceX. I don't really think either of them are in it for the money, but Musk's approach to date has been incredibly shrewd.",,,

Swiss Chocolate,What is the best Diwali gift you've ever received?,"We usually exchange sweet boxes among each other during Diwali. You know, the typical Soan Papdi box that goes to and fro. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, even that was not possible this year because we didn't visit anyone, not even the neighbors. But a friend of my father couriered a gift which was probably one of the best Diwali gifts I've seen and a little bit unique in its own way! The packaging was nice. The gift box was in the shape of a boat which stored the numerous gifts.  The parcel consisted of chocolates, dry fruits, green tea and well, a few funny stuffs too. Ferrero Rocher Moments Loaker's Dpuble Wafers. Lindt Chocolate Thins. A Nutella Jar. Twinings Green Tea. Dry Fruits - Cashew, Raisins, Almonds and Pistachio. Disco Mix - A type of Pan Masala. Anardana Goli. And a beautifully decorated candle.  Yeah, after eating all these one was surely in need of anardana golis to help in digestion. Needless to say, brother and I were fully occupied with the chocolates during this Diwali. Since we couldn't go out this year, we would have been bored otherwise but the chocolates saved the day. Ferrero Rocher Moments.  Lindt Chocolate Thins. This was my personal favorite. Swiss chocolate at its best!  The Nutella jar is also half finished and I don't think it will last two more days.

Swiss Chocolate,Why don't people choose authentic pasta and pizza recipes? Why do they always tend to overdo these simple dishes?,"There is a clear philosophical difference between America and some other countries, such as Italy, when it comes to food. In Italy, they tend to feel that only a few flavors are needed if those flavors are at their best. In America, partly due to the vast size of the country, they've adopted a culture of convenience for food.  Quality ingredients have been sacrificed in exchange for constant availability, long shelf-life, and low cost. American pizza uses tomatoes that have been bred for ruggedness at the expense of flavor.  The sauce is loaded with sugar.  The pizza uses cheese that is loaded with preservatives and has been sitting in a plastic zip locked bag for a month.  Because the flavors are muted there is a tendency to add more and more flavors - a cacophony of half a dozen toppings of mediocre quality, desperately seeking satiation. Italian pizza is as simple as it can get.  A fresh made dough cooked in a brick oven, with tomato sauce made from real tomatoes with mouth watering flavor, not too sweet and a bite of acid.  That is topped with fresh mozzarella cheese that was probably inside the buffalo two days ago.  If it's a Margherita pizza, there will be a few fresh basil leaves sprinkled atop. This unfortunate American philosophy carries over to other food items as well, such as chocolate.  American chocolate is designed primarily to be mass produced and cheap.  It uses substandard ingredients and even non-food items like paraffin wax, all at the sacrifice of quality.  As a result Americans need bigger pieces of American chocolate to satiate themselves.  Anyone that has traveled much has probably noticed this.  One can eat a small piece of Belgian or Swiss chocolate and feel satisfied because of the quality, but a much larger piece of American chocolate is needed. Americans don't want to be told something is out of season.  That means that food items have to be transported great distances.  They are picked too early or preserved in some manner that detracts from freshness.  They aren't as good, so additional flavors have to added to the recipes to mask the blandness. Americans have been trained by advertisers that bigger is better, cheaper is better, and now is better.  Their palates have been trained by food manufacturers to respond best to high fructose corn syrup, because that makes food cheap and easy to produce.  Unfortunately those advertisers and manufacturers are spreading these ideas around the world. Convenience is the death of quality.",https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-people-choose-authentic-pasta-and-pizza-recipes-Why-do-they-always-tend-to-overdo-these-simple-dishes,"This is true even for fruits (even though fruits are not ""manufactured""). Bananas, grapes, etc, seem to taste better in Frane (Europe) than in Canada... :-)","I couldn‚Äôt agree more with everything you said. Coming from an Italian family and living in an Italian neighborhood I can tell you that simplicity and freshness are all- important when it comes to food. Some of the things that Americans have done to pizza and pastas are laughable, if not sad. Keep it simple, keep it fresh and never settle for second-best when it comes to food. The classic Margherita pizza is a perfect example of this.","Agree 100% regarding chocolate. Even the identical Mars Chocolate brands, such as Milky Way, Mars, Twix, etc., from the UK are much higher quality. I don't understand the reasoning, but they are different and much more tasty.","This is totally accurate, but I think it misses a small point: we (Americans) actually have grown to enjoy and crave those ""mediocre"" flavors. The first time I went to Italy (age 17) and had a pizza, I was thoroughly disappointed. I thought it was very boring. I now appreciate its finesse, but it really comes down to personal tastes. I also grew up eating Hershey's chocolate, and I still love it. I know the cacao beans weren't hand roasted by Frau Hermann. They were processed in some megafactory in Pennsylvania. But I don't care - I think it tastes good. Have you ever tried to make a s'more with Ritter Sport? It doesn't work.",But buying local is becoming more popular in cities around the US.

To not put too fine a point in it, forgive me but it was foul. In the UK it would not even legally be described as chocolate, as it contains too little cocoa, and is chock full of preservatives. It tastes awful. The nearest thing I can buy in the UK of any similarity, is the cheapest cooking chocolate in a pound (Equivalent to your ‚Äú99cent‚Äù) store, and even that is being kind to Hershey‚Äôs. At least cooking chocolate is edible. The best chocolate I've tasted is all made in Europe. If you've never tasted: Belgian chocolate, of any brand, especially freshly made given to you if you tour one of their factories, Cadbury‚Äôs dairy milk, made in the UK Terry's chocolate, especially their chocolate orange, also made in the UK Swiss chocolate like Toblerone or Suchard Or even delicious Freia‚Äôs Smil from Norway, Then you haven't tasted chocolate and how utterly delicious it can be compared with the stuff you get in America.",https://www.quora.com/What-do-Brits-think-about-Hershey-s-Chocolate,"Yes, I once had a whole jar of American chocolate mini eggs given to me and I couldn't eat them.

Without him and Amazon I would likely be unemployed and I am so very grateful to have a job‚Ä¶any job; that said, I still rather envision him as an elf riding a dinosaur. Because there is no precedent for the global megalithic corporate monstrosity Amazon has become, the man has his hands on a set of reigns trying to control a commercial creature of almost mythical proportions and he is having to learn how to handle it as he goes day by day. There is no handbook that has ever been written that Mr. Bezos can follow; there is no real set of guidelines he can follow based on another person's prior experience. And, while I never expect to see him in person because it would be like a peon meeting the Pope, I wish him well with his riding lessons atop the leviathan corporate creature that has become his commercial creation. I admire his willingness to persevere in the face of a ton of negative publicity that seems to begrudge him the fruits of his labor and his grasp on his entrepreneurial endeavors. I think, at times, he has been very generous to his employees; and, I think at other times there is more that could be done for those who work extremely hard on behalf of his company. The balance is not always there in reality but I do think the man has tried to set up a system that is relatively fair to the majority of the people who work for him. Is it a perfect system? No. Not anymore than it is a perfect work environment. But, I do think it is an environment that is commercially viable and globally competitive arranged by a man who has the collective good of the company at the center of his focus. And, I think that his focus on the company's growth and profitability as a whole rather than pride in his own personal accomplishment in achieving great net worth and personal wealth makes him not only a ‚Äúnice‚Äù guy but a remarkable human being as well.",https://www.quora.com/Is-Jeff-Bezos-a-nice-guy,,,,,

Jeff Bezos,How much money did Jeff Bezos pay in taxes in 2019?,"Amazon has a long history of paying nothing to its shareholders, but investing everything they make back into the company. Most companies don‚Äôt have shareholders who are patient enough to tolerate that, but Amazon shareholders have been understanding. This means that Amazon as a company pays very little on taxes. Once the shareholders insist upon some dividends, then taxes (and a lot of taxes) will be forthcoming. To the extent that Jeff Bezos‚Äôs net worth is tied up in Amazon stock, he doesn‚Äôt have to pay any tax. But you can‚Äôt eat stock. Any stock he sells to create cash to spend on his lifestyle, will result in his having to pay capital gains taxes. Googling around, the amount of money he spends on his personal lifestyle is nothing compared to his wealth on paper. If his roughly $100 billion net worth is all in Amazon stock which cost practically nothing when he came into possession of it long, long ago, and he sells it to spend it on anything else (or at least diversify his portfolio, for crying out loud), he will have to pay 19.6%, or $19.6 billion in capital gains tax.",https://www.quora.com/How-much-money-did-Jeff-Bezos-pay-in-taxes-in-2019,"As long as Jeff only pulls out small amounts he can avoid paying that 19.6% for many years as it grows.

Swiss Chocolate,Which is a better place to live: Switzerland or the USA?,"I lived in Switzerland for 2 yrs, and then moved to the US. Life in general in Switzerland is IMO, better than US, and here's why:
 Higher standard of living : Swiss cities, houses and food are all top quality. Crime is very low, so you'd feel pretty safe roaming around in the middle of night all alone. There are no beggars on the street, and everybody around you looks very well off; it's surreal. You can drink from any public water fountain in the city, and all public places are kept really clean. There are many reasons why Z√ºrich consistently is rated as one of the top 3 cities in the world to live in.  Mercer Quality of Living Survey Higher pay and lower taxes : Swiss wages are pretty high. If you're a waiter, you get paid a minimum 20 CHF per hour. If you're an engineer or a banker, your salary is better than that of your US colleagues. On top of that, the taxes are relatively lower.  Swiss Tax Calculator Amazing public transportation / travel opportunities : You're right in the middle of Europe. From Z√ºrich, Germany is an hour away, France and Italy are 2. Everything else is a few hours by flight. The trains are all on time, and the transportation both intra-city and inter-city is very good. You can pinpoint any remote location and reach there solely by public transportation. Switzerland is also part of Schengen treaty, even though it's not part of the European Union. That means, citizens of visa-deprived countries (like India / China) can roam around freely in the EU if they're living / working in Switzerland.  SBB: Swiss Train System Better work life balance, and emphasis on sports : People work to live there. 8-5 culture is the norm, and people don't work on evenings or weekends. This applies not only to office-going folks, but also to general stores / shopping malls etc. Minus the bars, the entire city of Zurich closes at 7pm on weekdays, and opens only until 4pm on Saturday ( Thanks for correction:  Thierry Blancpain ). Nothing is open on Sundays. Everybody I knew was doing at least 2 sports on a regular basis, which also explains why Swiss are so fit. Almost  free education even during undergrad studies : As opposed to US, where an undergrad can cost you a mortgage and your parents have to save their entire lives for, the best of Swiss universities charge only ~500 CHF per semester,  regardless of nationality . This includes world renowned universities like ETH Zurich, and EPFL Lausanne, and is true even for master studies.  ETH - Rektorat - Semestergeb√ºhren/-beitr√§ge Clean smog-free air / beautiful mountains and landscape : Swiss  really care  about the environment. Air conditioners are frowned upon, if not entirely forbidden. Even when summer brought 32 degrees Celsius (~90F), we had to make do with fans both at home and at office.  Ah, the horror!  But well, it's good for the environment, and summer doesn't last that long. Another good example is the Gotthard Rail tunnel that Swiss are building to cut down on the number of trucks between Switzerland and Italy.  Gotthard Base Tunnel Food / Chocolate / Beer / Wine : The best of Swiss chocolate isn't sold at airports worldwide ( I'm looking at you Lindt ). In Switzerland, you get to eat  Spr√ºngli , which IIRC, has its main branch in Paradeplatz in Z√ºrich, right in front of Credit Suisse and UBS headquarters, and isn't available outside the country. In Switzerland, you can find good selection of Italian, French and German food as well. And you wouldn't be complaining about beer and wine.  Swiss chocolat.
So, why did I move? Now, here are 3 reasons where the US (well, California) fares better than Switzerland:
 Weather : Switzerland isn't known for its great weather. It's cold and wet 9 months of the year, and hot and wet for the rest. California boasts a weather straight out of heaven (minus the earthquakes, that is). Silicon Valley : If you're a software engineer, your  Mecca  lies in the San Francisco bay area. The choice of great ambitious companies, and cutting edge technology is unmatched in the rest of the world. Z√ºrich only has a few software companies, so if you choose to live there, you're pretty much stuck working for them. Foreigners are  tourists : Swiss don't believe in foreigners contributing to their society. For them, foreigners are something they have to bear with, and protect their society from. They're really kind-hearted people once you get to know them, but you wouldn't feel at home living there.",https://www.quora.com/Which-is-a-better-place-to-live-Switzerland-or-the-USA,Thanks for the comments. Feels great to have crossed 1K votes :-).,"""Minus the bars, the entire city of Zurich closes at 6pm on weekdays, and opens only until 12 noon on weekends."" As a night owl, I view this as an enormous ""con"" rather than a ""pro."" (And I don't really drink, so bars being open is no consolation.)",Want to ask a quick one: do you have to be able to speak German or French to live in Switzerland?,"Good overview. I lived in Switzerland for 35 years and now living back in the USA. I miss the incredible public transport (I never drove the last 2 years I lived in Geneva - in fact, a car is a big liability in most large European cities). Would comment that Switzerland has 3 pretty distinct 'cultures' depending on whether you live in the French, German or Italian-speaking parts so that will hugely affect your experience (and places like Geneva are practically not 'Swiss' because of the number of international organizations located there). The countryside in Switzerland is unparalleled and we miss the Alps. Healthcare is gernerally superior to the US. The Swiss have a reputation for a 'rules-based' culture (we used to joke that everything is forbidden if not expressly permitted) but ironically we feel somewhat less ""free"" in the USA because of the intrusive nature of US corporations into private lives (eg credit agencies). The cost of living is hugely expensive in Switzerland but the salaries are somewhat commensurate. Electronic banking in Switzerland blows the US out of the water - it's like going back 20 years compared to Switzerland (people still write checks in the US!). The US service economy is much better than Switzerland - you can literally get any service for an inexpensive rate in the US which would be prohibitive in Switzerland (e.g., pool maintenance, repairs, gardening). The only Swiss friends we made typically had a non-Swiss partner. Life in the US is hugely 'convenient' compared to Switzerland (e.g., supermarkets in the US are overwhelming in their choice and everything is open most of the time). Switzerland is a 'tiny' place compared to the US and there is a sense of 'smallness' in many aspects of daily life.","When it comes to switzerland, the flag is a big plus!"

Jeff Bezos,"Who will be remembered for the longest time in history: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, the Google founders or Steve Jobs?","Enduring fame is a tricky thing. I just discarded ‚ÄúThe Stories of John Cheever,‚Äù a 1980 paperback that‚Äôs adorned with a starburst on the cover, declaring it to be ‚ÄúThe Majestic National Bestseller.‚Äù Now, it‚Äôs an outdated relic, full of morose stories about college-educated suburban men making poor moral judgments. It‚Äôs too arch to be taught in schools; it‚Äôs too insular to seem at all relevant in today‚Äôs multicultural society. I don‚Äôt want to read it, and I can‚Äôt imagine anyone else who does. Back in the day, Cheever was big. Now he isn‚Äôt. If we‚Äôre going to speculate about the way history treats this era‚Äôs biggest business and tech names, we‚Äôll need to watch out for some version of the Cheever Effect, too. Fortunately, two researchers have come up with a smart way of doing reputational time travel. I‚Äôm going to share their results ‚Äî as they apply to the days of Thomas Edison, John D. Rockefeller, etc. ‚Äî and then suggest a direct answer to your question. Our tour guides for this project are Steven Skiena, a computer science prof at Stony Brook, and Charles B. Ward, a Google engineer specializing in ranking methodologies. As  this article  in Smithsonian magazine attests, the two of them ‚Äúsubject[ed] the historical zeitgeist to the brute rigors of quantitative analysis in a recent book,  Who‚Äôs Bigger? Where Historical Figures  Really  Rank .‚Äù Recapping from the Smithsonian‚Äôs piece, their analysis started with ‚Äúthe English-language Wikipedia, which has more than 840,000 pages devoted to individuals from all times and places, plus data extracted from the 15 million books Google has scanned. They analyzed this data to produce a single score for each person, using a formula that incorporates the number of links to each page, the number of page visits, the length of each entry and the frequency of edits to each page. Their algorithms differentiate between two kinds of historical reputation, what they call gravitas and celebrity. . . . By their reckoning, Jesus, Napoleon, Muhammad, William Shakespeare and Abraham Lincoln rank as the top five figures in world history. In terms of U.S. business giants across the ages, numbers two through five on the Smithsonian/Skiena/Ward rankings are Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller, J.P Morgan and Walt Disney. But I haven‚Äôt told you yet who ranked number one. Ready to take a guess? Close your eyes and see what you come up with. If you offered up Thomas Edison, William Randolph Hearst or Howard Hughes, you‚Äôre still in the top 10, but you didn‚Äôt get the winner. At the top of the list is Andrew Carnegie. It‚Äôs the steel guy ‚Äî or, more exactly, the man who sold all of his steel mills in 1901, at age 66, so he could spend the remaining 18 years of his life championing Carnegie libraries, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Carnegie Mellon University. It‚Äôs those philanthropic entities that live on in the public eye, keeping his reputation so prominent. If that pattern holds, it‚Äôs easy to answer your original question. My bet‚Äôs on Microsoft founder Bill Gates, mostly because of what he‚Äôs likely to accomplish with the second great project of his life, the Gates Foundation.",https://www.quora.com/Who-will-be-remembered-for-the-longest-time-in-history-Jeff-Bezos-Bill-Gates-Elon-Musk-the-Google-founders-or-Steve-Jobs,Hmm I‚Äôd say Edison. The only reason I recall Carnegie is CMU. I only know much of Hearst due to people mentioning that Citizen Kane is based on him; and Hughes due to the recent film about him. I‚Äôd bet far more people know who Edison is than Carnegie.,Awesome answer.,"Gates is on track to literally wipe a major disease off the face of the planet. That's the sort of accomplishment that endures in historical memory. I can think of some others who're aiming for even bigger fish, so to speak ‚Äî like Aubrey de Grey, who wants to end aging (!), Demis Hassabis, the most visible of the research leaders aiming to 'solve intelligence', and perhaps Elon Musk, should his long-shot Mars project come to fruition. I wonder which of today's world leaders will truly endure.","If we really pull off the transition of transportation energy away from fossil fuels Musk will be remembered (even if others end up taking the lead). If not, we'll all be underwater or baked or both, so none will be remembered‚Ä¶. Except on Mars I suppose. Carnegie has the advantage of having given away a lot, and spreading it around. All those Carnegie libraries. I suppose Gates was trying to do something like this with the educational programs but they haven't had Carnegie level impacts.",But it clearly helps to stamp your name on things. Gates needs to do more of that.

Jeff Bezos,"Who is a better CEO, Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates?","Having worked for both, I am going to go with Bezos. Although in a way it's not a fair comparison. Both were/are brilliant. Both were ahead of their time with their ideas. Gates did not have a career before Microsoft. He succeeded on sheer intellect, shouted down dissenters, and basically on brute will got Microsoft to the top. The flip side of that was a massive arrogance that got Microsoft slapped with a federal consent decree and basically crippled it for a decade during which it completely lost its mojo and missed the big mega trends of the 2000's (web, mobile, social). Basically, Gates's Microsoft was a cult of personality. Bezos had a successful career on Wall Street before Amazon. He realized that the internet was going to change consumer commerce, books, music, and video were the biggest mail order items at the time, so he laid out his vision and did it. But what he really invented and why Amazon is still spinning off things like Prime, Kindle, AWS, Alexa, etc is that he invented a culture of experimentation. It doesn't so much need his intellect as it needs his stewardship on fostering that experimental culture. That is not only more sustainable but it is also more empowering to the workforce, all the way down to the individual contributors. Both obviously historically great. Bezos better overall.",https://www.quora.com/Who-is-a-better-CEO-Jeff-Bezos-or-Bill-Gates,"Microsoft churned out more profit last year than Amazon has in its entire existence. Amazon is Bezos' Cult of Personality. You could imagine (and we saw) other leaders at Microsoft. Who is the other guy at Amazon? Gates was a businessman first and foremost. He didn't buy grocery stores, build warehouses or hire thousands of people at random. One of his ironclad rules was A) No long term debt and B) Keep enough liquid cash in the bank to run the company for at least a year with zero revenues. Amazon likely cannot function for 12 months with zero revenue. The whole thing is like a giant Ponzi Scheme, though I don't mean to suggest that Bezos has done anything wrong. What I mean is that Amazon relies on a mountain of weekly revenue in order to fund operations. If it had to liquidate right now, it is starting with more current & long term debt than cash on hand. It might come out of a liquidation with $23 billion-hardly enough to justify a $700 billion market cap. Gates did not bully anyone. He bullied ideas and proposals-there is a difference. On a personal level, I despise his politics and his personality but there is no denying his brilliance as a money making CEO.","They both have one common factor, one day they both will pass away, and neither will take their somatic bodies or the billions they have.

(a)  PM Suspects the meeting could be an Anti CAA - NRC Agenda -  Jeff Bezos is an American CEO and barely a week ago - Mirosoft Honco Satya Nadella gave a scathing statement on the CAA and NRC which is the BJP Governments 2019 Innings brainchild. Perhaps PM Modi has got offended with All American Businessmen believing that everyone would be criticising this move. Modijis Howdy Modi ended up delivering ZILCH and Modi is already annoyed enough at the US. Perhaps the PM was also extremely busy - facing a lot of issues to allott time for a Man who was clearly not a supporter or endorser of his Govt policies but also a Man who could tell him that the CAA-NRC would be a problem for India and which would and could be eaten up by the Media. (b)  PM Modi is simply too busy to bother with the Meeting -  I dont really buy this myself. The Man meets anyone of significance from Nobel Prize Winning Laurate to Bollywood Actor to a Dabbawalla from Mumbai if it would get him a few pictures and some propaganda. Yet with the CAA Agitations and the Impending Budget - PM Modi could simply have had too much on his plate and may have felt - meeting the CEO would not be feasible. (c)  Indias Leading Oligarch would have interfered with the Meeting -  BJPs entire treasury comes from a handful of Oligarchs, the Biggest of whom is Mukesh Ambani who is planning to start a huge retail chain himself - through some hocus pocus method which keeps shooting his stock through the roof amidst an economic slowdown. Now Mr Mukesh Ambani preferably wants Amazon out of India - as Competition is something which is not in the Indian Genes. Mukesh wants a Monopoly on Online Retail and Amazon is a stumbling block. Tomorrow  ED and CBI may arrest Amazon Top Honchos in India for Corruption Charges  OR  IT Departments/Tax Departments in BJP States or Centre may make absurd claims  OR  RBI may declare Amazon Pay as illegal and demand 15000 documents.  That is separate in itself. Bottom line is Mukesh may have instructed the Govt not to meet with Bezos as BEZOS is the ENEMY. (d)  Elections in Delhi -  While the possibility of this is slim , Mr Giris Ramachandran- a Quora user  suggested in his comments that Modi would avoid Bezos so as not to annoy the Trading Communities. Now how are small traders actually affected by Amazon? Now if the Public is getting things at a good price - WHY SHOULD I CARE IF THE SMALL TRADERS LOSE BUSINESS? Should the common man be prepared to pay higher prices just to finance the Small Traders? That is Protectionism 101 which was Nehrus speciality I doubt if Modi Govt really gives a damn for Protectionism. They have outright supported importing from abroad over manufacture in India for Arms and Defence and in many cases believe in Capitalism regardless of consequences. So while i doubt this theory - It may still be possible Any of these is possible It is upto the Quorans to guess which of these possibilities makes most sense. To me it is likely to be (A) or (C)",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Modi-government-so-mad-at-Jeff-Bezos,"Very hard hitting, specially the way you have put some points across, like Modijis Howdy Modi ended up delivering ZILCH and Modi is already annoyed The Man meets anyone of significance from Nobel Prize Winning Laurate to Bollywood Actor to a Dabbawalla from Mumbai if it would get him a few pictures and some propaganda BJPs entire treasury comes from a handful of Oligarchs ‚Ä¶wants a Monopoly on Online Retail and Amazon is a stumbling block But here is another one. While Modi is being castigated on his tall promise of crores of jobs and delivering only a fraction while helping with the loss of millions due to demonetization, Bezos is claiming to bring in ANOTHER million jobs in the next 5, apart from the existing jobs helping 10s of thousands make a living. This must touch a raw nerve with our resident egomaniac and he is responding through his minions (so he can play good cop, bad cop) this way. What do you think?","I enjoyed reading your answer because you simply put various theories and refrained yourself from giving verdict, instead you left it to readers.","Sir, Point (d) is wrong on so many levels. Aren't the small traders also sellers on Amazon? Won't there be one election or another in India all years? Shouldn't PM be looking our for the country rather than elections? Why is the PM still in election mode when we need better look at economy, etc? If point (d) is true, it actually makes our PM an anti national. I hope it is not the case.",you missed the Washington post is owned by Jeff and the continuing anti India propaganda article was the reason Modi ignored him,Fantastic answer! Possibility C seems to be the most probable reason in my opinion. There maybe other brands inside India ready to invest in this same market. Government maybe skeptical because of the recent trend of unwillingness in long term investments from abroad.

Chip Shortage,Is chip shortage a political thing? When do we expect the shortage to end?,"The current chip shortage is a real thing. in general, the semiconductor business is a boom/bust cycle of business. As a result, the companies that own the chip making, are not really interested in investing in more production facilities because there is a high likelihood that a plant will soon sit idle. Next, to build a state of the art chip plant, it‚Äôs going to cost in the neighborhood of 20‚Äì30b. You just don‚Äôt invest money like that on a small uptick. Finally, demand has gone up. Modern cars require chips. EVs require probably 10x the number of chips as an EV. A whole new line of customers has come on board competing for chips. the chip shortage is a real demand issue. It is not political at all. what makes this political is when intel or TSMC wants tax abatements for a new plant. You have to go around and kiss a## to get the appropriate sign off. And building chip plants takes lots of time. It requires some really expensive people. These people aren‚Äôt just running around on the street. it is a nightmare.

What factors led to historians making such conclusions?,"Gupta Period witnessed Golden Age mainly in the fields of art, literature and Science. Balaji Viswanathan has given a detailed answer and I would like to add few points.
1.The Epics 'Mahabharata' and 'Ramayana' were given final touches and the 'puranas' were written in this period.
2.Aryabhatta wrote 'Suryasiddanta',in which he proved that Earth revolves around the sun and rotates on its own axis.
3.Varahamihira wrote 'Panchasidhantika',in which he said that the Moon moves around the Earth and the Earth,together with the Moon,moves around the sun.
4.The art of casting metals reached a degree of development.ex:The Iron Pillar of Delhi, near the Qutub-Minar, is a marvelous  work belonging to the early Gupta period.

Age of Empires 4,Why are Ethiopians more warriors and heroes than the whole of Africa?,"Ethiopia was never colonized. Ethiopia is the oldest country on earth. Ethiopia can boast about having the oldest nobility: Solomonic dynasty. Ethiopia is regarded by many as the first Christian state : Axum. Axumite King Ezana was the first monarch who minted coins bearing the Christian Cross. Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia was a king and an Emperor. Today, Haile Selassie is worshipped as God incarnate among some followers of the Rastafari movement. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church says that it possesses the Ark of the Covenant, or Tabot, in Axum. Ethiopia is the headquarters of the African Union and plays host to the biannual AU summits. It also serves as a conference center for African and diaspora businesses. The Battle of Adwa when Ethiopia defeated Italy is regarded as the African Victory in the Age of Empire. There is a great literary tradition in Ethiopia and Ethiopians are using the same script that their ancestors used more than a thousand years ago.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Ethiopians-more-warriors-and-heroes-than-the-whole-of-Africa,"Let me add another: 11.Egypt had opened war on Ethiopia to control the source of Nile 18 times.Ethiopia has defeated them in all fields 12. Ethiopia  is the largest troop contributor to  UN peacekeeping  with over 8,300 uniformed personnel, the vast majority of them serving in Darfur (UNAMID), Abyei (UNISFA) and South Sudan (UNMISS). ... UNAMID deployed a battalion from  Ethiopia  (more than 800 soldiers) to protect civilians in the area in July 2012. 13.In 1951, the Ethiopian Emperor, Haile Selassie, decided to send thousands of troops to fight as part of the American-led UN force supporting South Korea against the communist North and its ally, China. 14.Many American soldiers pay their life for years to control the Terrorist( Al Shabab ) for years and left Somalia unsuccessfully. But Ethiopian soldiers went and cleared Al Shabab and establish new Civil in months.Now Somalia is better in peace 15.Still Ethiopian Soldiers are in Sudan stopping the migration of over 300,000 civilians due to civil war. They are also on the boundary of Sudan and south Sudan. Why? Ethiopian donot try to envade any country.But if any one attempt to cross Ethiopian borders, all ethiopians are ready to die for their country.For example, if Egypt try to attack GERD dam, all 115 million peoples will go to battle fields in weeks. Ethiopians are patriotic. Ethiopias land is also brave fighter‚Ä¶no enemy can escape if it enters Ethiopia terriotary.The land is full of plateus,valleys,‚Ä¶.80% of African mountains in Africa are in Ethiopia.That is why Ethiopia is called the roof of Africa‚Ä¶Ethiopias troops are the 2nd strongest fighters next to Israel in ground fight .

We Ethiopians never invaded any people or nation even when when we had had a strong kingdom. We are just people. We do not want to be dared. If dared, we won't hesitate to die while defending our land. This is the truth. Do not try to associate the issue with christianity!",Totally appreciate your response and advance knowledge of the Afru-ika Diaspora and their true Historical Legacy,"9. The Battle of Adwa when Ethiopia defeated Italy is regarded as the African Victory in the Age of Empire. Are you joking? Because you‚Äôre only telling half of the story. The Italians conquered Ethiopia in 1936, first thing they did was abolish slavery, Ethiopia was so ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù it still had slavery in 1936, after the British defeated the Italians in 1941 they put Haile Selassie back on the throne and the first thing he wanted to do was to bring back slavery, but the British put a stop to it Ethiopia is a third world country, rife with corruption, famine and constantly mistreats its Muslim population, now don‚Äôt get me wrong I have nothing against Ethiopia per se, but stop pretending it‚Äôs something that it‚Äôs really not."
Age of Empires 4,"Why doesn‚Äôt PM Narendra Modi attack Pakistan, even after the recent Uri attack in India?","Because this is not some Age of Empires or Rise of Nations or other such computer game that Modi is playing. We are dealing with real life, real lives, and real situations here. You cannot just give an electronic order in a barrack to produce soldiers, in an artillery factory to produce tanks, set a formation, and with the click of a mouse, go to War. The Indian military might is far superior to the Pakistani military, but that doesn‚Äôt mean there won‚Äôt be any costs for India in the event of a war. Pakistan still has a well-trained army, which is driven by a fanatic hatred towards you know who. Pakistan least cares for its citizenry, but India does care of its civilians. So a full-scale war which will definitely result in loss of at least some Indian lives would not be something Modi would initiate. The response by India after this cowardly attack is not going to be passive or non-violent. One must remember what happened few months after Modi became PM, when the Pakistani army had begun to create nuisance along the LoC. Modi gave the border forces a free hand, and every night, the Indian border forces rained around 2500 mortar shells on the Pakistani posts along with horizontally escalating the conflict. After the severe pounding which lasted for some weeks, the Pakistani army were beaten into submission. After Pakistan‚Äôs military excesses in PoK and Baluchistan having begun to attract global attention courtesy India, it was but natural that their military was going to be pissed off. However, the cowards that they are, they do not want to take on the Indian armed forces themselves. And hence, they send their proxies whose minds have been programmed since teenage to believe that getting killed while fighting the Indian army will bring them a special ‚Äògift‚Äô from Allah after their death. So, why do you think Modi or his government will stay silent this time? The response from the Indian government may not be a visible one, or may not be communicated via media. Certainly you would not want sold out souls like Barkha Dutt, Sagarika Ghose, Rajdeep Sardesai, Kanhaiyya Kumar, Kumar Ketkar, and Arundhati Roy discussing over primetime television about whether the Indian response is appropriate or not, or advocating the ‚Äòneed to find a diplomatic solution by having a dialogue with all stakeholders‚Äô. The response from India might be in the form of strategic assassinations of terrorist leaders deep into Pakistan, showcasing the plight of the Baloch citizens at the hands of the Pakistani military, economic isolation of Pakistan, and in extreme events, deployment of the extremely scary BrahMos missile near the Western Border of India. If you are thinking that the Indian government of the day is going to be unreactive to the incident, you must ask yourself how are there so many firsts in the last two years? First time we have raised Balochistan issue, first time so many foreign funded NGOs operating illegally in India have been cracked down upon, first time there are talks of Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan, and PoK residents wanting to secede. This could be the second time Pakistan gets broken up? That will hurt them much more than sending tanks, soldiers, and fighter planes to bombard the civilian territory and endanger the carefully cultivated positive image of India.",https://www.quora.com/Why-doesn‚Äôt-PM-Narendra-Modi-attack-Pakistan-even-after-the-recent-Uri-attack-in-India,"Well written,  Baseema . The last paragraph nailed it!","Nicely crafted. This issue is too delicate to handle. We have to first analyse the long term effects of future before we do anything. Unfortunately the main issue is, Pakistan has nothing to loose while India has certainly manything to loose if we declare war. Our growth engine is running on the top RPM and war will certainly affect it in terms of foreign investment , tourism etc etc. The guys discussing at news hour in media are highly immature and playing with people‚Äôs sentiment by urging Modi to declare war or perform surgical attack and what not. but it is not that easy and also not viable. offcourse We are superior in terms of defence power but at the same time they are also not the one which we can be easily ignored.","because attack cannot be the solution of this problem, I think if we work on out security system more, we would be in better direction.","I think he knows and we all should understand that he can‚Äôt take decisions based on his joomla‚Äôs on each and every scenarios.

Jeff Bezos,How did Jeff Bezos make Amazon such a technically innovative company?,"Disclaimer: Although I work at Amazon (since 2005), the below opinion is my own. I don‚Äôt believe the key to Amazon‚Äôs pace of innovation is a secret. Here‚Äôs an except from  Jeff Bezos‚Äô 1997 letter to shareholders : The past year‚Äôs success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in being a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com‚Äôs success. It‚Äôs not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, ‚Äú You can work long, hard, or smart, but at Amazon.com you can‚Äôt choose two out of three ‚Äù), but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren‚Äôt meant to be easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passion build Amazon.com. It‚Äôs certainly not a place for everyone. Being smart isn‚Äôt sufficient; you need discipline and drive. But when you get a group of like-minded people together‚Ä¶ oh, it‚Äôs exhilarating. Things  get done . There‚Äôs no overbearing bureaucracy stifling innovation; internally, Amazon operates like a bunch of different companies ‚Äî which leads to a bit of duplication of work, sure, but your launch is never blocked because you‚Äôre waiting for UltraFramework v0.1 from Team Bobblehead to get approved for release, for example. We don‚Äôt get boggled down by ‚ÄúTPS Reports‚Äù: product definition documents, test plan documents, release plan documents, etc. We  start with the customer and work backwards . This typically means  writing the press release first  (even for wholly internal products). Have an idea for something you want to work on? Write the press release and a brief document to sell it to your leadership team and work with them to get this funded and green-lighted. (I‚Äôve done this three times in my 11 years, getting positions or entire teams created for pieces that I felt were too important and/or cool to ignore.) That doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt run tests and experiments, or write feature specs; we just consider these byproducts of development, not important development milestones. Take a look at  our leadership principles  (also previously linked); we measure both ourselves and candidates against these. Some of them relate directly to technical innovation (‚ÄúBias for Action,‚Äù ‚ÄúLearn and Be Curious,‚Äù ‚ÄúInvent and Simplify‚Äù). But the first two ‚Äî and, I believe, the most important ‚Äî are ‚ÄúCustomer Obsession‚Äù and ‚ÄúOwnership.‚Äù These  drive and enable  constant innovation. Can you innovate without these? Sure, but the resulting ivory tower designs mean you won‚Äôt survive to release 2.0. Of course, this crazy pace can become overwhelming, ever for those of us who normally find it exhilarating. That said, I‚Äôve never gotten pushback from my managers when I wanted to take time off; just don‚Äôt leave your team hanging (‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to Hawaii tomorrow. Sorry I didn‚Äôt finish $CRITICAL_COMPONENT we need for launch on Friday‚Äù). I‚Äôve never gotten pushback from managers; only encouragement on this front. This year, for example, my family and I have taken a week skiing, a couple weeks on a lake, and we‚Äôre about to head out for the Christmas holiday for a couple weeks.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-Jeff-Bezos-make-Amazon-such-a-technically-innovative-company,,,,,

Browder, who made the claim before the  Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday , is one of the best authorities on Putin‚Äôs business dealings. Browder was a major investor in Russia during the  chaotic 1990s , when, according to  Newsweek , he took stakes in former state-run enterprises such as  Gazprom . During the same period, Browder cooperated with Putin in anticorruption efforts, but eventually found himself targeted by Putin. That conflict eventually led to the jailing and death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, and in turn to the Magnitsky Act sanctions against certain Russian oligarchs by the U.S. Thanks, Take Care.

Jeff Bezos,Do Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos secretly hate each other?,"I suppose the main reason most people suspect that they dislike each other is because of  Blue Origin and Spacex  Jeff Bezo‚Äôs founded Blue Origin  which is a private aerospace manufacturer and Spaceflight company and like SpaceX they have the objective of providing human access to space at a low and affordable cost.

Jeff Bezos,What are Jeff Bezos‚Äô secrets to success?,"Jeff Bezos knows that he is generally the smartest guy in the room and has no qualms letting everyone else know (‚Äúdo I need to bring the piece of paper that states I am CEO‚Äù?) Many of Bezos‚Äô secrets to success go against conventional business wisdom. For example Jeff thinks consensus building is bad because it curtails big ideas. PowerPoint, an essential business tool is banned at Amazon. Why? Because Jeff believes that a presenter can hide behind graphs and graphics, so Jeff favors writing. And hence the (in)famous 6 page narratives. Jeff‚Äôs biggest secrets are these- ‚ÄúOther companies work hard to charge the customer more.  Amazon works hard to charge the customer less ‚Äù. + Offer the greatest selection at the  lowest price. Jeff has an excellent understanding of consumer behavior. He knows  that most people are cheap  and would rather save $10 on a $100 pair of shoes to get it on Amazon in 2 days than buy it at  Sports Authority  (out of business) or $50 on a $1000 TV from  Circuit City  (also out of business).

Jeff Bezos,How did Jeff Bezos create Amazon as a sole founder?,"Shel Kaphan was the first employee; there was an interview with him in GeekWire:  Meet Amazon.com's first employee: Shel Kaphan . In that interview Shel says that Paul Davis was the second technical hire. Shel tells about the early days of building Amazon:  When I first got there, we didn‚Äôt have any computers yet, so the first job was to go shop for some computers and decide what database systems we were going to use and what software was available. I mean, nobody knew how to write Web sites at that point in time. I had never done it before. So, we had to figure out how were going to do that.
They wrote the first version of Amazon in C. (Today we write web sites in  languages  that are written in C.) That C code was still in operation, powering large parts of Amazon, until at least 2006. Bezos got other early hires by posting on Usenet; one of the first job postings began:  Well-capitalized start-up seeks extremely talented C/C++/Unix developers to help pioneer commerce on the Internet. You must have experience designing and building large and complex (yet maintainable) systems, and you should be able to do so in about one-third the time that most competent people think possible.
(From  How Jeff Bezos advertised for the first Amazon employees ) ‚ÄúWell-capitalized‚Äù in 1994 meant $1 million, as Bezos once said in an interview:  In 1995, I had to raise a million dollars from 22 angel investors who invested around $50,000 each to fund Amazon, and the question all those investors had was ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the Internet?‚Äù
(From  ""It's Day One""- Jeff Bezos Takes Stock ) Bezos has a strong technical background‚Äîsee  Is/was Jeff Bezos technical? ‚Äîso he could evaluate the early technical hires and their work himself, even though he didn't have a traditional technical co-founder/CTO.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-Jeff-Bezos-create-Amazon-as-a-sole-founder,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,Did Jeff Bezos build the Amazon website on his own?,"Amazon  (former name  Cadabra Inc. ) was registered in July 1994. On August 21, 1994 they posted a bulletin - board on usenet which read that they were looking for extremely talented  C/C++/Unix  developers who had an experience in designing and building large and complex systems in one-third the time that most people take. Their fore most employee was  Shel Kaphan  who some also consider as an co-founder of Amazon . Later that fall they hired  Paul Davis , a programmer who was a staff member at the University of Washington's computer science and engineering department. All three of them started working on SPARC - station in the garage of Jeff's house at Seattle. The first engineers of Amazon coded in computer language  C  since HTML was barely a decade old and languages like Javascript and AJAX were years away. While Kaphan and Davis were working on primitive beta website, Bezos would attend courses in bookselling to learn how to select inventory and manage it. He also started hire other employees. The book  The Everything Store  by  Brad Stone  clearly depicts that Bezos had hired people from the starting of Cadabra Inc (now Amazon) to write the codes and develop the website and along with them he would code too but comparatively to others he devoted more of his time in other works like paperwork, arranging the things which are required, attending courses, hiring people, etc then developing the website. So,  No  Jeff Bezos did not develop the Amazon website on his own. The source of the above mentioned information is from the book - The Everything Store by Brad Stone.

Jeff Bezos,How did Jeff Bezos develop his legendary reading and comprehension skills?,"Jeff Bezos was identified as being intellectually gifted from a young age.
In elementary school he was part of a experimental accelerated learning program. Within this small group, Jeff and his classmates were stretched mentally with complex and abstract comprehension questions.  Clearly Jeff thrived in this environment, and it instilled in him a lifelong passion for learning, discovery, and synthesizing information. Jeff exhibits a clear ""growth mindset"", to use the framework of Psychologist and Author Carol Dweck. People with a growth mindset believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study.  During college he studied computer technology. Interestingly, he dropped out of physics before switching to IT. In his early career he worked in finance, specifically in a heavily quantitative-based discipline of asset management. This work requires extremely high aptitude for numbers and the scientific method.  So Jeff is not only skilled in language and comprehension, but also has an high aptitude for mathematics.  There is undoubtedly much natural talent and intelligence that Jeff was born with, but what sets him apart from others who are ""born smart"" is knowing from a young age that any skill or body of knowledge is attainable with focused effort.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-Jeff-Bezos-develop-his-legendary-reading-and-comprehension-skills,"He majored in electrical engineering and computer science, not IT.",,,,

Chip Shortage,"If the chip shortage keeps getting worse for automakers, will they possibly figure out a way to manufacture vehicles in the future without it?","Car manufacturers already know how to make cars completely without chips, they did so for over 80 years, then, in the ‚Äô80s tiny computers (the chips) became available cheaply, so manufacturers started competing with each other in offering the consumer cars with ever-higher power, ever-higher miles/gallon and with ever more features, the chip made this possible. Then, agencies like the EPA came into the picture and mandated fuel efficiency and reduced emissions into law, at the end, cars now have as many as 1,500 microcomputers in them.  To some extent, the consumer probably would still buy a car with fewer chips thus fewer features (if all cars had fewer features), however, without microcomputers (the chip) in the engine management, engines could not deliver the efficiency and low pollution that is now  law . In a nutshell, to directly answer the question‚Ä¶ the car could be built but the law would not allow that car to be driven on public roads. Here‚Äôs the irony to all this. The machines that build the chips are incredibly complex, most are designed and built in America by companies such as LAM Research (below is a picture of such machines), but instead of using these machines to make chips in the USA, the machines are exported and the USA then imports the chips made by American machines. To give it even more irony, many of the chips themselves are designed in America but made in Asia using American machines. APPLE is probably the biggest culprit... every bit of the iPhone, including the chips, are designed in America but none of it is made in America. To give Trump some due were warranted, this is the kind of absurdity he was trying to address.

Age of Empires 4,"Was there 60,000 elephants used in the battle in the Chola Kingdom?","If one tells a big lie, one will be forced to say one hundred lies to defend the original lie. This comes under that category. I really pity the guys who have to dig out something zany to defend their big brother. Now let us come to war elephants. 60,000 war elephants, is it feasible? I am just an armchair commander. Even I have enough sense not to use elephants too much in Age of Empires because they go batshit crazy. In fact, if you have played AoE you will know it is much easier to build infantry and it is very costly to build elephants. That is AoE maintaining historical ratio of infantry and elephants for you. So anyone with a modicum of logical mind will ask how is it possible to have an elephant army of 60,000 with 150,000 infantry. One war elephant for every 3 infantry is inviting trouble for yourself in the battlefield because if the enemy incites them (which is not that difficult to do), your infantry is toast. Now let us look at how elephants have been used historically: Darius - 15 elephants against Alexander in Battle of Gaugamela Porus - 200 elephants in Battle of Hydaspes Nandas - alleged to have had max. 3000 elephants by some Greek accounts. Seleucus - 500 elephants Pyrrhus - 20 elephants More importantly Hannibal who had access to African elephants, crossed the Alps with 50,000 infantry, 10000 cavalry AND 37 elephants. Yes, just 37 elephants. All this is history. Basically elephants only served as some kind of shock troops in battle and they were anyway difficult to control. Even Mauryas were supposed to have had max. of 8000 elephants, which itself could have been an exaggeration. Now view this 60,000 elephant claim against this and it will look laughable. I think some forces are paid heavily to make such claims and make Tamils look like fools in the world stage. Hey what about Chau Ju-Kua? He says 60000 elephants in his book. Yes he does. Only small problem is he wrote that book in 13th century, long after Cholas were gone. He basically wrote what he heard from another guy called Lingwai Dada, who wrote about it in 12th century based on something he heard from somebody else. Basically none of these guys even visited the Chola empire and seen the elephants. In short - Cholas would not have had to access to 60,000 elephants in the first place even accounting for the fact they controlled the current Kerala region. As great generals, they would have known better than using elephants too much in battle. What about transporting 60,000 elephants by ship? Age of Empires allows 4 elephants per ship, so that would be 15,000 ships. Even those magnificent eyes of Helen of Troy themselves launched ‚Äúonly‚Äù 1000 ships if one were to believe Homer.",https://www.quora.com/Was-there-60-000-elephants-used-in-the-battle-in-the-Chola-Kingdom,"Na namba matten.

The CHINA virus started a chain reaction series of events that caused many companies to close down, cut their employee production in half, investing less in research and development, distribution, marketing, manufacturing, budget reduction, cost increases due to shortage or delays in product and materials, ans so on and so on. Because people were restricted in what they could do, where they could go, how and when they could get from one place to another, and in general no longer able to live and work proactively, comfortably, less stress and anxiety, basically a somewhat normal life.

Jeff Bezos,Is there a good biography of Jeff Bezos?,"(UPDATED May 13, 2020) The standout Amazon/Bezos biography ‚Äî pretty much regardless of what part of the overall story interests you most ‚Äî is  The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon: The author is Brad Stone, who spent years covering Amazon for Bloomberg BusinessWeek. I‚Äôve competed against him in various journalism jobs, and we also overlapped as Bloomberg colleagues for a few months in 2011. He is a very thorough and well-focused reporter. Bezos didn‚Äôt talk to Stone for this book, but a wide cross-section of other people did. There are excellent insights from Amazon alumni, and also clear portraits of other long-time Amazon leaders like Jeff Wilke and Andy Jassy. What‚Äôs more, Stone during his beat-reporter days spent enough time with Bezos to understand up-close what makes him tick. The result is a book that‚Äôs rich with details and neither fawning nor ignorantly hostile. There‚Äôs a steadily simmering debate among people who know Amazon best about whether Stone got the full tone and coloration of Amazon/Bezos exactly right. On a subject this big, any book is likely to have its share of minor controversies, omissions or arguable interpretations. But a lot of people see Stone‚Äôs overall perspective as a balanced, middle-of-the-road approach. And if you want to treat it as a repository of well glued-together information that you can reassemble in your own mind to be the Amazon/Bezos take that you regard as even more reliable, that is totally your privilege. There are other notable books, too, and if you‚Äôre deeply interested in Amazon/Bezos, you can learn something from each of them. For the early years of Amazon and some of Bezos's own background, try  Amazon.com: Get Big Fast, by Robert Spector:  That book came out in 1999, I think, so a lot has happened since then, which won't be in the book. But if you're interested in how Amazon got started, Spector has some good original reporting in there from various early investors. A more recent book is  Amazon.com: One Click: Jeff Bezos and the Rise of Amazon.com by Richard L. Brandt. , That book came out in 2011, so it does cover Kindle, AWS, the space initiatives, etc. Brandt didn't have any access to Bezos, and a lot of his chapters draw heavily on what's already been published elsewhere. A little-known book that is quite interesting for an insider's peek at Amazon and Bezos is  Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.Com Juggernaut, by: James Marcus:  It was published in the dot-com bashing climate of 2003 and unfairly faded from sight pretty fast. But Marcus calls the shots well, drawing on his own experiences as an early Amazon employee to explain why the company could be so fiercely successful while leaving many employees exhausted and marginalized. His time at Amazon ended on a sour note, but his personal frustrations don't poison the book. You'll learn a lot about how Amazon's very unusual culture came to be.",https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-good-biography-of-Jeff-Bezos,,,,,

Jeff Bezos,Why is Jeff Bezos going on a rocket?,"There are two reasons why Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson flew into space. 1.) Because they could. In days gone by you had to be pretty wealthy to take a summer vacation in Europe, when traveling from the U.S. Now, it is fairly commonplace. Which brings us to the second reason. 2.) A demonstration that travel to space is relatively safe enough for tourists. You do not have to be in extreme shape and specially trained to participate in a government funded expedition to space. Richard Branson has announced that tickets on future Virgin Galactic will start at around $450,000. While that is well out of my budget, it does open the door for many people. Jeff Bezos‚Äô passenger list on his Blue Origin flight included 82 year old Wally Funk and 18 year old Oliver Daemen, a dutch physics student. Personally, I was thrilled to see Wally Funk on the list. She was a member of the Mercury 13, women‚Äôs astronaut team. At the final phase of the training NASA decided that only males would be selected for the official program. It was great to see her finally achieve her dream of a space flight. I would like to suggest to both Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson that they make an effort to include other members of the Mercury 13 in their flights. Of course, it will depend on their health and willingness, but it would be great to see these women, that were denied the opportunity strictly because of gender, finally achieve their goals. At the moment, the flights they offer are parabolic flights, not orbital flights. I am fairly certain that orbital flights will come later. Virgin Galactic reached an altitude of around 53 miles, while Blue Origin reached about 65 miles. The minimum altitude for an orbital flight is about 150 Km, or 93 miles. Now, would I take a ticket?  IN A HEARTBEAT!  I am now 72. I took my first first flight to London about 4 years ago. It was a polar flight and an experience I will never forget. The idea of going into space, even if not an orbital flight, Oh, HELL YES! I witnessed the advent of the space age with the launch of Sputnik and all of the social changes those challenges brought.

Jeff Bezos,"Jeff Bezos said Amazon will go bankrupt, is this true or just a publicity stunt?",He is possibly right but less likely then it is likely. For one he made a comment that 'Amazon is not to big to fail' and that is 100% obvious. 'To big to fail' refers to the governments being willing to step in and bailout a company or industry because it going bankrupt would be a economic disaster. If Amazon disappeared tomorrow it would mean nothing to the economy. So if Amazon miss steps and finds itself going bankrupt it will not likely be saved by any government. Note: It would obviously be a economic disaster in terms of massive numbers of job loss but it would be a short term issue over all as all the companies in the industries amazon disappeared from would expand to fulfill the market demands and would end up hiring all those people that lost jobs. On the other hand his comments are just useless dribble in reality. Its what basically anyone would say about their company even if they didn't believe it because it would be extremely dumb to publicly state anything besides a modest and humble opinion. The average life of a big company is useless data and means absolutely nothing. Thier is not enough time first off in history that business has existed. Some of the earliest businesses still exist today and that is a huge accomplishment considering the leaps and bounds they had to overcome in the technology boom in order to not be replaced. If you have companies that lasted from pre Moore's law to the end of Moore's law then I assure you that companies that dont have to survive that going forward are alot more likely to not fail. More importantly the average life of a business is useless since it has no correlation to a single business. The deviation is basically +- infinity since some business have never failed and some have failed almost immediately. Amazon is huge and has its branches far spread into dozens of industries already and the chance of Amazon as a whole failing seems very unlikely. Even if they miss step in one area they have many other branches to cover that miss step monetarily speaking and at worst would have to liquidate themselves from the industry they made the miss step in.,https://www.quora.com/Jeff-Bezos-said-Amazon-will-go-bankrupt-is-this-true-or-just-a-publicity-stunt,Good perspective; well anchored.

Swiss Chocolate,Where do the Swiss get the raw materials to make the chocolate for which they are famous?,"While cacao trees originated in the Andes, most of the world‚Äôs cacao beans now come from Africa. Chocolate merely needs a hot and wet climate. So most of Switzerland‚Äôs cacao comes from Africa. Milk chocolate, for which Sitzerland is most famous, needs cocoa butter, which conveniently has a melting point just below human body temperature, and a bit of milk. It‚Äôs possible that Swiss cows graze on a certain type of grass, but more likely they are just good at making chocolate. The Germans and Dutch and Luxembourgers make fine chocolate as well, the Belgians, IMNSHO, the world‚Äôs best.

I would assume other chocolatiers do the same and blend those ingredients together and make their chocolates that way. Swiss chocolates are very high in cocoa content and very chocolatey. American chocolates are just too high in sugar and other artificial flavors. South American chocolates are almost exclusively used for flavoring different recipes ranging from sauces to meats and marinades.

Swiss Chocolate,Why are the Swiss so good at chocolate making?,"They aren‚Äôt. Historically they were known for coming up with the conching process, which is a staple in most modern chocolate making facilities. However, they haven‚Äôt done a whole lot since then (and that was in the late 1800s) to differentiate themselves. These days, there are hundreds of bean-to-bar chocolate makers all over the world, and many of them make exceptionally good chocolate. Most people associate Lindt with Swiss Chocolate, but by today‚Äôs standards, Lindt chocolate is mediocre at best. They do a decent job making it, but it has very litter character or flavor to it. World class chocolate makers who are widely respected in the chocolate industry are instead focusing on lots of fine-flavored, single origin cocoa from quality farms or plantations and are carefully tuning their processing of the chocolate to get optimal flavor from each batch of beans. When chocolate is made in that way, you get amazing flavors of fruit, nuts, earth, spice, tobacco, flowers, etc. coming from different bars of chocolate, something you just don‚Äôt get from today‚Äôs Swiss makers. So while their historical contribution to chocolate is certainly admirable, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying Swiss chocolate these days, considering all the other better options out there.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-Swiss-so-good-at-chocolate-making,,,,,

Age of Empires 4,Why isn't Age of Empires 3 as popular as Age of Empires 2?," Above: Age of Empires 2 Opening Trailer  Above: Age of Empires 3 Opening Trailer Writing this review as someone who had far more experience playing Age of Empires 3 than 2, I can probably attest to some of the most troubling aspects of Age of Empires 3 that I feel made the difference between turning the game into a classic, versus turning it into a good, but somewhat forgettable game for all but a small niche of the gaming market. My time on Age of Empires 3 is mostly limited to within the first two years of the game‚Äôs release, when elo rankings were first introduced, as well as the period where the two expansion packs came out. It was also the same time period when I witnessed the game going from an average daily population of 15‚Äì20,000 active players to fewer than 2,000 within a span of only a few months. Watching current players playing online streams, I have noticed that the population nowadays hovers closer to 500‚Äì700 and it rarely exceeds 1,000, even during peak hours.  So, what went wrong? First, the way the home city shipments were designed were completely flawed. Later on, the developers at least gained a little bit of common sense and made it so that all civilisations started off at level 10 so that you could quickly gain access to the basics, such as faster cavalry and infantry, but that was not the case when I and other users first started playing the game. All new civilisations started at level 1, which means you were stuck with 15 crappy cards (not even a full deck of 20) and you had to more or less endure this disadvantage until you played enough games to reach level 10, where more advantageous cards, such as rapid cavalry and infantry, would finally become available. If Age of Empires 3 wanted to be unique by allowing players to choose their home decks, then they should have made it so that all players could instantly choose the deck of their choosing without the need to turn this into some sort of role playing quest where you have to play with an inferior deck before you can move on to a better one. Games are supposed to get harder as they go along, but the deck makes that theory completely obsolete, thanks to the well-intentioned, but poorly thought out approach to allowing players to customise their playing style to their liking. Furthermore, the elo ranking system was heavily flawed and ripe for abuse. Unlike what the ranking system may have been intended, it did not represent a player‚Äôs skill, but merely how many games they won. A player who stacked a game and played against weaker players could inflate their ranking, whereas a player who played against players stronger than them would see their true rating deflated because they weren‚Äôt likely to win too many games. In team games, this was even more problematic, as the strongest player in the game could still end up losing if their ally was too weak to compensate for their strength. Ultimately, both of them had their elo rankings deducted, despite one player being clearly stronger than the other.  Ultimately, few players were willing to play a team game unless they had an ally who was at least a strong or even stronger than them (and then, that other player would likely refuse them as well, because they also wanted a player as strong or stronger than them and so forth). Finding games became more difficult to do, and with the two expansion packs (War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties) coming out a year apart from each other, the community found themselves even more segregated, as players in an expansion game could only play with players who were themselves logged in the expansion version and vice versa. This meant that the declining population of players were effectively categorised into three sections: those who remained true to the vanilla version, those who preferred War Chiefs (a rarity in later years), as well as those who spent their time playing Asian Dynasties. Servers also started to become buggier as time went on, as less and less money was being dedicated to preserving the ESO community. When I first started playing the game, it was rare for me to see any lagging, and if it did happen, it was because either myself or someone else was having a bad internet connection for reasons outside of ESO‚Äôs control.  Later on, however, this was no longer the case, as I would test my connection by playing other games and they worked fine. My internet would only start acting up when I logged onto Age of Empires and tried to get a game going. The strategy game play is also much different than Age of Empires 2. No doubt, the graphics in Age of Empires 3 was an improvement, and the home city deck as well as the elo rankings would have been a blessing if the people who thought up these ideas would have planned them out better. Age of Empires 2, however, is a more classical type of strategy game, where microing your units to the point where you select hotkeys for each individual unit during a battle is not required to the same level as in Age of Empires 3, where outclicking your opponent can make all the difference between victory and defeat. For the first year or two, Age of Empires 3 stayed somewhat loyal to the old concept, as I don‚Äôt recall microing units in battle to have been as popular as in later years, simply because the units were not so overpowered that they could change the outcome of a game with a single click. Gathering resources and having a firm control of the map were as important to the old Age of Empires game as the military units a player spawned, and the later patches more or less undid that.  Deathmatch was even more impacted by the new changes compared to supremacy, as deathmatch has always been a quicker-paced game that relied more heavily on being able to quickly respond to an opposing player‚Äôs attack. Deathmatch is effectively the bullet chess version of the Age of Empires world, where everything happens at a much faster pace than supremacy; and yet, the patches made certain units so powerful that a player could literally decimate another player without having to make an economy if they knew how to use their unit hotkeys efficiently enough. On top of that, because the game allows for players to resign within two minutes of a game starting, this meant that a player who was caught off guard by a rush in deathmatch would simply resign before the two minute mark, making it impossible to beat such players and actually expect to get a rating. (And if you managed to kill all their units within that time, it also would not count as a win.) The two minute deadline might have made sense when we are talking about supremacy, but in deathmatch ‚Äî where a good rusher can spam hundreds of heavily cavalry in as little as 45 seconds ‚Äî the two minute marker is quite egregious, as it gives a player who is not willing to accept a loss the time to resign and deny their opponent the win.  Supremacy was not much better, either, as players were effectively forced to do the same types of strategies as they would in deathmatch, except on a smaller scale and at a much slower pace than in deathmatch. Aging up was probably the most significant difference between deathmatch and supremacy, as it allowed one player to gain the upper advantage by either gathering up more villagers before aging up, or by attacking their enemies so that they would be forced to spend their resources on purchasing a new army, rather than upgrading their units by going to the next age. Once you got to the intermediate level, there wasn‚Äôt much diversity in strategy, as players who reached the intermediate level were more or less playing the same way that expert-ranked players were, with the difference being that the more experienced players could usually do what the game needed them to do at a faster rate than intermediate players. Bobby Fischer, Paul Morphy and Jose Raul Capablanca all admitted later in their lives that they hated chess, because they realised how repetitive the game could be to the point where players were doing far more memorising than strategy to win a game.  Above: Bobby Fischer Explains Why He Hated Chess Similarly, Age of Empires 3‚Äôs patches limited the playing style to the point where gathering resources, approaching a battle creatively, or getting the right types of units became quite moot in the grand scheme of things. A player who could mass an army of skirmishers could easily devastate an army of heavy cavalry during an initial attack. While a decent player would have artillery and infantry of their own to counter this threat, it still does not change the fact that heavy cavalry were once dominant over skirmishers. By 2008, the patches had been modified to the point where 50 fully upgraded French cuirassiers could barely kill 100 skirmishers, despite costing far more in resources, as well as being the strongest anti-infantry unit in the French civilisation. Apparently, some of these patches were designed as a way to balance supremacy games, but it only worsened the gaming experience for players who enjoyed deathmatch games. Eventually, I began to play far more supremacy than deathmatch, simply because the patches had made the gaming style too focused on spamming military units and doing quick hotkeys that it was no longer stimulating my interest. By contrast, even though I did not play Age of Empires 2 as much as I did Age of Empires 3, I did notice that in Age of Empires 2, players can get away with sneaky strategies that would never fly in Age of Empires 3 (unless we are talking about low-ranking games). This meant that there was more diversity, and players could play the game to their own liking, rather than the more scripted type of game play currently seen in Age of Empires 3. For comparison, I will show some Age of Empires 2 and 3 games at the bottom of this article for players to see for themselves. And, finally, I have heard that the moderators were far nicer and more helpful in Age of Empires 2 than Age of Empires 3. Since I never dealt with any of the moderators there, I cannot personally confirm whether or not that is true, but I do know that in Age of Empires 3, the moderators were very quick to give people temporary or even permanent bans for fairly trivial reasons that had nothing to do with cheating or harassment. For instance, moderators were very quick to ban you for a day (or longer) if you were caught by them talking about non-Microsoft games, because they would claim you are advertising for a competing gaming company etc..

Age of Empires 4,Why do many people consider Age of Empires II as a better game than Age of Empires III?,"So here are my main reasons: Build limit : Making you limited results in fewer strategies. You can build only 13 towers with cards. So you will lack defense unlike AOE 2 where you could tower rush and have no worries about any limitation. Forts were limited to 2 if you were not revolting and thus another lack of proper defense. (You couldn‚Äôt rebuild them) Historically-Inaccurate campaign : I mean, Fountain of Youth would work in AoM because it‚Äôs fictional and a myth. A secret order is another fictional and not fitting theme for a historical game. The Black family is all made up. They should have Napoleon, Suleiman and all the historical characters there and not just name AIs after them. Unflexible Pop Limit and Unit Pops : In AOE2 you can have more or less than 200 pop. It‚Äôs not fixed to 200. But in AOE3, 200 is all you get.
About the unit pops, this makes most of the cavalry having 3 pops for each unit. And thus not having an exact 200 soldiers. Overpowered Units and Civilizations : Most notable examples of OP units are Mamelukes and French Cuirassiers. Both are very hard to counter and don‚Äôt have an exact counter when massed. Even the Persian War Elephant in AOE2 (which was a literal beast) could be countered with both Monks and Halberdiers. Overpowered civs are French and Japanese with their insanely powerful army late-game. Lack of Conversion for all Monks : I remember only one civilization in AOE3 could convert units and thus makes a popular feature in AOE2 unavailable in AOE3. Home City Cards : While this feature tried to add customization into the game, It added a level restriction (which could be edited inside the XML files and not be considered a cheat for MP). Skillpoints could be changed into any number you wanted and you could have 44 cards instead of the standard 25 just by editing the XML files and no cheat detected for MP. On another note, you could just search ‚ÄúBest Deck for this civ and that strategy‚Äù and get the best deck for that strategy and civ. No customization here. Lack of Resource Challenge and Stockpiles : Both food and gold could be generated for an infinite amount of time and There was no shortage of wood. Villagers collected resources and just kept doing it until it was finished, no returning to TC or a stockpile. Farms only cost 100 wood for 11 farmers and there was no need to reseed them. Same for the infinite Gold generators. This takes away the economic challenge. No building required for the next age. Lack of proper trash cavalry : Hussar (which was a trash unit in AOE2) now costs gold. No cavalry in AOE3 is a trash unit. (That sucks) Smaller maps than AOE2 or maybe worse positioning : In AOE2 in a Giant map you would not be next to your ally always but in AOE3 even in 2v2 games you were so close to your ally. That would make you share resources with your ally(Hunting animals for most) and giving you pressure early game. The good things about it were: Great graphics : Units get thrown around when a cannon shoots them. That's cool. Multi-Queue : One of the annoying things about AOE2 was you only could queue up your units and after they were created you could research something. This is going to change in AOE2 DE. Also creating 5‚Äì10 units at a time was OK. Zoom : You could observe the battle by zooming in and out in AOE3 but not in AOE2 (before capture age spectator). This is coming to AOE 2 DE. Building Collapse : This is part of the graphic section but it‚Äôs huge so I decided to separate it from graphics. Building collapse was satisfying especially when it was collapsing while being attacked. The destruction collapse animation is coming to AOE 2 DE. AI communication : In AOE2 you could communicate with allies but the options you had were way less than AOE 3. The favorite of mine was the Attack Here feature which lets you strategize your ally a bit more. A better AI communication is coming in AOE2 DE.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-people-consider-Age-of-Empires-II-as-a-better-game-than-Age-of-Empires-III,3 point perspective projection method annoys me the most.

Indirectly for some people it might cause them to get a different car, maybe a brand or model they wouldn‚Äôt normally get, and that might establish a new loyalty‚Ä¶but in the big scheme of things this is a minor effect.

Some may not get a new car and end up not ‚Äútesting it out at speed‚Äù, and avoid an accident, maybe one involving severe injuries and/or death, probably rare though. Looking at an entire country or world, maybe unnoticeable.

Chip Shortage,"Why do we have chip shortage, and what is being done to mitigate the issue?","When the pandemic struck, a lot of chip users cut their advance orders massively, expecting a downturn in demand. The chip manufacturers accordingly cut production. But, it turned out, demand did not fall but rose. A lot of things that people did to handle the pandemic, such as remote working, used chips. And people stuck at home unable to spend money on entertainment bought gadgets with a lot of chips. Demand rising, production falling: shortages. The solution is, obviously, to increase production. The turned down factories are being turned up again. But lead times from raw silicon to shipped chips are 3 months or more. There is a backlog to make up, and demand is still high.

Samsung mainly manufactures their own chips, but does make chips for other companies. TSMC and GF only make chips for customers.

Jeff Bezos,Is it fair for Jeff Bezos to have so much money?,"Yes. It‚Äôs not just fair. It‚Äôs well-deserved. The amount of people proclaiming that Amazon employees should get a cut out of Bezos‚Äô wealth because they‚Äôre a part of his business make me cringe till no end. Let‚Äôs say you open your own restaurant. You see a great amount of growth in your business due to the popularity your restaurant has gained. Will you give back the wealth you earned from the restaurant to all the customers you‚Äôve had since day one? No, right? Why? Shouldn‚Äôt you distribute your earnings among your customers, since they‚Äôre the ones who helped your business grow? You get the point here. Capitalism is free-market. Period. You get what you work for. You buy what you want. You work for whoever you want. You stop working for someone whenever you feel like doing so. Amazon is a result of a well-functioning capitalistic society. Jeff Bezos has earned all his wealth because people  CHOSE  to buy his products/services. Amazon employees are getting paid by Amazon because they  CHOSE  to work for Amazon. Even if Jeff Bezos did not build the product on his own, he  CHOSE  to build a business out of online products. Notice the pattern there?  It‚Äôs all about choices. Just because someone built a product for Amazon doesn‚Äôt make them the owners. In the restaurant example I gave above, will you give all your revenues to your chef, since he/she is technically the one creating the product (food)? No, because you  CHOSE  to create a restaurant business with multiple products (Pasta, Pizza, Smoothies) and multiple teams (chefs, waiters, delivery agents, inventory manager, etc). You hired those people because there was a need for their expertise/skills and you were willing to pay them for the same. If the chef feels like he should own the business, he is free to start his own venture. He can‚Äôt just show up to you (his employer) after joining as an employee and claim to be the owner of your business. Replace ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô or ‚ÄòAmazon‚Äô with any business and you‚Äôll have the same answer. Amazon pays it‚Äôs employees and partners on pre-decided terms and conditions. Unless Bezos‚Äô wealth is earned by tax evasion, robberies, illegal practices, etc., it‚Äôs rightfully his money. It‚Äôs upto him if he wants to spend it on extravagant mansions, charity or just light a fire on it. He doesn‚Äôt owe his wealth to anyone. You think Bezos doesn‚Äôt deserve his wealth because Amazon has poor quality of products? Good. Build a business and offer a better quality of products than Amazon. Give people a reason to buy them from you and not Amazon. You think the rich should be taxed heavily because its ‚Äòunfair‚Äô to others? (whatever that means) Good. Be prepared to pay higher prices for the same products/services and be prepared to see yourself losing your job to automation. You like the idea of distributing your wealth among <insert any group of people>? Good. Do it with your wealth. Don‚Äôt force your ideals or practices upon others.

Jeff Bezos,What are the best stories about people randomly meeting Jeff Bezos?,"I interned at Amazon in the summer of 2004. At that time, Amazon used to have an internal summer dodgeball league. It was taken pretty seriously since the team that won the summer playoffs got bragging rights for the rest of the year and an icon on the internal directory.  In one of the games during the playoffs, my team faced off with Jeff's team, which was him and a bunch of senior VPs.  At one point during the game, a bunch of balls were thrown simultaneously from both sides, and when the commotion died down, Jeff and I were both in front of our respective teams, closer to the centre of the court. He thought that he had hit me and I was out, while I was quite sure that I'd caught his ball and that he was out.  He pointed at me and told me that I was out. I said no, and told him that he was out. He told me that I was wrong and that I was out. We then proceeded to yell at each other animatedly, each pointing at the other and telling them that they were out. In my moment of competitiveness, I completely forgot that I was an intern who really wanted a job at this company at the end of the summer. So, yelling at the CEO and calling him a liar was probably not the best tactic!  Anyway, we yelled at each other for a bit and then turned to the ref. The ref kicked Bezos out :) That incited the signature booming laugh from Jeff and he very sportingly walked off the court.  -- PS: I got a job at the end of the summer, and proceeded to work at Amazon for 8 years.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-stories-about-people-randomly-meeting-Jeff-Bezos,broomball!,You don't want to know... trust me!,I think Jeff got the better deal out of this ;),Did you leave after 8 years?,"Jeff, you dropped the ball!"

Swiss Chocolate,"Is there a legitimate difference between the chocolate we buy from brands like Hershey's and Nestle and the chocolate made by the Swiss, who are known for their chocolate? If so, what are the major differences?","There is a huge difference between standard, cheap, industrial chocolate and fine chocolate. I wouldn‚Äôt correlate that to country though. There‚Äôs plenty of crappy chocolate all over the world. Even Lindt (which most people think of for Swiss chocolate) is still just okay when you start comparing it to excellent chocolate made with fine flavored cacao beans. There is a more ‚ÄúEuropean‚Äù approach, where chocolate is made with cocoa, sugar, added cocoa butter, and vanilla; compare that to the ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù style of just cocoa and sugar, without anything else. But part of that is also an old vs. new style, and there just happen to be more new bean-to-bar manufacturers in the US than in Europe. The big differences are: High quality chocolate has no other additives or chemicals, just cocoa, sugar, cocoa butter, and vanilla. There may be bars that have nuts or fruit or something, but the actual chocolate itself is unadulterated. High quality chocolate has beans from specific locations that have interesting flavor. Often, these beans are used as ‚Äúsingle origin‚Äù, meaning a bar will be made with ONLY beans from a specific location, to really emphasize the unique flavor of those beans. For comparison, most industrial chocolate will blend a lot of cheaper, widely available beans to get a pretty consistent flavor from one bar to the next, for years and years. High quality chocolate is expensive. That‚Äôs just inherently true. In order to ensure you have good beans from good plantations and they are handled properly, it requires paying the farmers more and investing more time and care into the processing. Expect to pay maybe 8 to 12 US dollars for a really good bar. If you are curious to try some really good chocolate, Valrhona is probably the most widely available chocolate that is really excellent (their Manjari bar is a great intro if you‚Äôre new to nice dark chocoalte - it‚Äôs not overly dark and has great fruity flavors that will have you coming back for more). You can also look for smaller local makers (note you want a chocolate manufacturer, NOT a chocolatier who is just manipulating chocolate that someone else made). You can also look online at sites like  Craft Chocolate | Dark Chocolate Gifts - Bar & Cocoa  or  Chocolopolis Home Page - Chocolopolis .

Swiss Chocolate,Why does Swiss milk chocolates (and even British chocolates like original Cadbury‚Äôs) taste so different from US chocolates like Hersey‚Äôs (or US version of Cadbury‚Äôs)? (Personally I prefer the taste of European chocolates),"It is all down to Cocoa and how much they use and also the quality of the cocoa liquer and cacoa butter. Britains chocolate is typical 35% and dark chocolate being about 70%, though Britain does make many types of chocolate that uses up to 100% cocoa. Europe once even tried taking Britain to court saying our chocolate had not enough cocoa in it to be called chocolate and wanted us to rename it Vegelate, their court case failed. Most chocolate bar manufactures these days know the importance in the quantity of cocoa in their chocolate bars and put the persentage on their bars. I found something interesting on cocoa on internet and have added it below to help with this answer. Does the Percent on Your Chocolate Bar Really Mean It‚Äôs Healthier? Not all chocolate is created equal, but it‚Äôs safe to say the Snicker‚Äôs bar isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúhealthiest‚Äù option‚Äîif that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for. But how do we know how to get the most nutritional bang for our bite? It‚Äôs all about the  type  of chocolate. These days, manufacturers are actually making it easier to make that call by noting the cacao percentages of products right on the packaging. But what‚Äôs really the difference between a bar with 80% cacao and another with 60%? And  why  is a higher percentage of cacao touted as healthier? Let‚Äôs take a closer look. The Basics Simply put, the percentage of cacao listed on a chocolate bar tells you how much of that bar consists of actual cacao bean product. That cacao bean product is made up primarily of chocolate liquor, which refers to a combination of cocoa solids (ground cocoa powder) and cocoa butter (the naturally occurring fat in the cacao bean). Extra cocoa butter (and sometimes, extra cocoa solids) is often added to make the chocolate creamier or more intense in flavor. If you‚Äôve got an 80% cacao bar, 80% of that bar will be made up of that chocolate liquor + added cocoa butter and/or solids combination, with the remaining 20% made up of fillers‚Äîmostly added sugar. Although manufacturers aren‚Äôt required to break down the exact proportions of cocoa butter and cocoa solids in a given bar, you can generally assume that the higher cacao percentage listed, the more of the total combo it contains, and the darker it is. Does a higher cacao percentage mean a more bitter chocolate? It‚Äôs a pretty reliable rule of thumb that the higher the cacao percentage, the more bitter the chocolate will be. Still, like with anything, there are exceptions. Just like coffee beans, cacao beans come in a huge range of flavors  depending  on the type of soil and environment they‚Äôre grown in (warm, humid climates are best!) and how they‚Äôre harvested, fermented, roasted, and tempered. In addition to the type of bean they use, manufacturers can also opt for different ratios of cocoa solids and butters to make their products, so one brand‚Äôs 73% cocoa chocolate bar can taste much less intense than another‚Äôs. Generally, though, you can safely bet that chocolate with 80% cacao will be significantly more bitter than chocolate with 40% cacao. Does a higher cacao percentage mean a healthier chocolate? While many people might prefer the sweeter taste of milk chocolate, there‚Äôs a reason why most nutrition experts have crossed over to the darker side. Since the cocoa bean is what actually contains the  flavonoids  that provide heart-protecting, anti-inflammatory, brain-boosting, mood-lifting properties, it‚Äôs only natural that the higher the  cacao content , the healthier. Plus, a higher cacao percentage usually means that there‚Äôs less space for additional ingredients like  sugar ‚Äîwhich we know isn‚Äôt doing us any nutritional favors‚Äîand dairy, which might  block the absorption  of cacao‚Äôs antioxidants.",https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Swiss-milk-chocolates-and-even-British-chocolates-like-original-Cadbury-s-taste-so-different-from-US-chocolates-like-Hersey-s-or-US-version-of-Cadbury-s-Personally-I-prefer-the-taste-of-European-chocolates,,,,,
Swiss Chocolate,What is the name of the Swiss dish that usually involves melted cheese or chocolate?,"You may be thinking of fondue, which is a molten cheese or chocolate mixture. You would normally dip cubes of bread into a cheese fondue, or fruit or cake into a chocolate one. Both are typically served during get-togethers, partly because the minimum volumes of ingredients are quite high for just one or two people, and partly because the cleanup is quite light. A third type of fondue, which the Swiss call fondue Chinoise (Chinese fondue) involves dipping bite-size morsels of meat into a hot oil mixture. In all three cases, the dipping dish is typically round, with a rotating tray of dipping pieces set up around it. Also, as fondues are all very rich, they‚Äôre normally served during winter. In Switzerland, except for mountaintop restaurants, it‚Äôs rare to find cheese fondue or fondu Chinoise on a menu between about April and October",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-name-of-the-Swiss-dish-that-usually-involves-melted-cheese-or-chocolate,,,,,
Swiss Chocolate,"Why did the Swiss specialize in watches, banking and chocolates?","Chocolate became popular throughout Europe during the 19th century, but two Swiss inventors developed the production technology that revolutionized the industry and produced the highest quality chocolate: Daniel Peter, a candlemaker put out of business by gas-lamps, fell in love with a chocolate maker's daughter and became the chocolatier that developed milk chocolate (and how to evaporate milk to preserve it and the milk chocolate's quality). Rudolphe Lindt developed the chocolate conche, a machine that made the chocolate smoother, richer tasting, and with superior melting and forming characteristics. Watches originated in Germany and watchmaking quickly spread into Switzerland and France. The major Swiss contribution to watch making was the creation of interchangeable parts (Leschot, in Geneva) and mass production - they made watches plentiful and reasonably cheap. Switzerland became a mass-producer of watches. Later, after price competition from US watchmakers started to affect their revenue, the Swiss transitioned from lower-quality mass-produced watches to focus on precision and durability for which they could command a better price. With regard to banking, Switzerland considers the right to privacy a fundamental personal right and this extends into their banking regulations. For example, in Switzerland, accounts can be setup without identifying information for the account holder in the normal bank records; it's legal to secure that information with the bank officers and replace all identifying information for the account with a numerical code (a so-called ""numbered account"") for an extra level of privacy. The logical result is that people that wish to keep their holding private are very well protected by Swiss bank account and Swiss law. This means that many wealthy parties use Swiss banks, as well as certain parties that have reason to hide their assets.",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-Swiss-specialize-in-watches-banking-and-chocolates,Numered Bank accounts do not exist in Switzerland anymore.,,,,

Age of Empires 4,Every empire has met its end. When do you think the 'Western Empire' (American Empire) will end?,"‚ÄúAll a great power has to do to destroy itself is persist in trying to do the impossible.‚Äù  Stephen Vizinczey There‚Äôs a theory that empires last for eight or ten generations - that‚Äôs about 250 years - depending on how you count a generation. If that‚Äôs true, the U.S. is in the eighth, ninth, or even tenth generation. That‚Äôs not a good place to be: somewhere between decadence and collapse. There are striking parallels between the decline and fall of the Roman Empire and the decline of the United States. The ages of empire    have been defined as these: 1. The age of pioneers
2. The age of conquests
3. The age of commerce
4. The age of affluence
5. The age of intellect
6. The age of decadence
7. The age of decline and collapse.  But first you have to establish if the U.S. is an empire in any sense of the word. Certainly, it has been a commercial empire and the possessor of the world‚Äôs reserve currency for a 100 years. Certainly it has transformed the geopolitical map of the world. Certainly it has had an enormous cultural impact on the rest of the world, for better or worse. While it doesn‚Äôt directly rule a lot of countries, it has a huge number of costly military bases, 800 to 1,200 (depending on how you count them), flung around the globe. These vast military commitments are the financial and administrative equivalent of maintaining an empire. And, of course, the U.S. likes to try its hand at taking over countries from time to time - such as Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq - in the name of freedom, but it‚Äôs just not that good at it. Empires in decline and collapse have certain features that uncannily resemble the current state of affairs in the U.S. But first, read carefully the famous quotation that sums it up: ‚Ä¶ Already long ago, from when we sold our vote to no man, the People have abdicated our duties; for the People who once upon a time handed out military command, high civil office, legions ‚Äî everything, now restrains itself and anxiously hopes for just two things:  bread and circuses Roman satirist Juvenal (circa A.D. 100). So responsibility for failure lies firmly with the people abdicating their agency in a democracy in favor of the following: A completely disconnected and dysfunctional ruling class  The president doesn‚Äôt really control the plutocrats, but a great president can stand up against them. Unfortunately, we probably need to go back to the 1960s or possibly even to FDR (who presided over the high point of American hegemony in 1945) to find one. Shameless greed  It speaks for itself. Individuals who have many times more wealth than they or their families could possibly consume for generations wanting even more - and figuratively snatching it out of the hands and health of the poor. An abased currency based on fiat not value  The Federal Reserve says the U.S. doesn‚Äôt have enough inflation. However, a $100 in 1980 is worth about $300 in today‚Äôs money. ‚ÄúGladiatorial‚Äù entertainment  A preoccupation with spectacular, sometimes violent entertainments that distract the masses. An obsession with celebrity  An obsession with sex  An obsession with food and celebrity chefs*  *Really, they had them in Rome too.",https://www.quora.com/Every-empire-has-met-its-end-When-do-you-think-the-Western-Empire-American-Empire-will-end,You extensively use Glubb Pasha‚Äôs observations but Glubb Pasha‚Äôs estimate is 250y not 200y. As you say it depends where you start. 1776 is too early. I think the Mexican-American war is too late. I favour 1812. I think historians will draw a line somewhere between 2026 and 2062 and say that was the end of the American Empire.,"You are doing yourself a disservice by including your comment on inflation. First of all, the tripling of prices over 36 years reflects an annual inflation rate of only 3.02%. The average over the past 100 years is 3.18%. Moreover, if you look at the inflation in recent times you will see that it is far below average. ","Rome was a military empire. USA is a commercial one. Until another competitor with just as good as the American triangle ( Education/ Research/ Development + Manufacture + Commercial Distribution) do not appear, the USA commercial empire will survive. China pushes too hard on commerce+manufacturing, education and research are done in the old industrial style and until they will realise the difference, Europe is still the second competitor.","A better historical analogy to the current USA‚Äôs evil empire than the Roman Empire in Juvenal‚Äôs time, might be the Hapsburg Empire towards the end of the Thirty Year‚Äôs War. Both empires frittered away miraculously enormous windfalls on hopeless military adventures and allowed their internal societies and economies to collapse while doing so. The Hapsburg‚Äôs windfall was New World gold and silver. The USA‚Äôs was an absolute domination of the post WW II world economy, the financial leverage given the US dollar by Breton Woods, and the US dollar‚Äôs status as the world‚Äôs primary reserve currency. Both empires engaged in endless and extremely expensive wars, the Hapsburgs to impose Catholicism on all their realms and maintain a hopelessly over-extended imperial reach, the USA to maintain world hegemony, grant Israel a regional hegemony, and impose a US type polity and economy on temporarily occupied foreign countries. The Hapsburgs wound up barely surviving as third-rate European powers. The USA will be lucky to come out of its current imbroglios with a similarly reduced status on the world stage. I expect that economic failure will end US imperial pretensions within two or at most three decades. Even using the most optimistic of accounting procedures the USA can never pay off its over $72 trillion in government, corporate and private debt. Right now the country‚Äôs economy is a massive Ponzi scheme, depending on foreign loans to keep the scam going. At some point the rest of the world will realize this and the US economy will collapse, taking down any possibility of maintaining the country‚Äôs imperial reach. The failure of the economy is also likely to result in levels of internal social disorder not seen since the War between the States, perhaps even a full-scale civil war or a smoldering civil war like that which racked Ireland during the 1920s.","In fairness Rome came back from the brink several times, the question is are we in the fourth century, or the fall of the republic?"

Age of Empires 4,What made your childhood so nice?,"I used to stay at my home all the time except school. This helped me explore myself and a variety of activities. I was at the top of my class, I was great at orating, painting and playing the keyboard. I have  great parents  who never burdened me with anything and brother who took care of me all the time. I developed an early habit of  reading . I used to read the newspaper, storybooks, academic books, and what not. I used to  play  with my father and brother a lot. It helped me in achieving good physical growth and made some great memories. I used to play a lot many  video games . I have completed NFS Most Wanted, GTA San Andreas, Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, and a lot many other games I forgot the names of. My favourites were Avernum (any fans here? I haven't found a single Avernum player except me till date), Age of Empires, FIFA, GTA games, etc. I became highly focused on  academics  at the right time. It was around class 7 that I began to think of competing at the national/international level and started studying accordingly. I  never went for tuition . I hate the fact that many parents send their children to tuition at the age of 10‚Äì11 (some at the age of 5 as well). Never fell into the coaching trap spreading fast in India. I joined coaching in 8th and dropped out after 2 months. Then I joined again in 9th and dropped out after 6 months. I never went in 10th. I did attend a coaching in 11‚Äì12th for JEE, but still I used to study stuff on my own as per my wish (I began following their system in 12th because that was the need of the hour). I was a very  lonely kid . I never had (and I still don't) any friends except 1‚Äì2 (and even they left me after a few months everytime). This might sound like a 'poor kid' to many of you, but it was a blessing. I get to spend time with myself, listen to music, sit and ponder about future plans/past mistakes, study, read books, etc. Most importantly, I  never left school  from nursery till 12th. I see people joining dummy schools in classes 8‚Äì9th these days. What do they want from their life? I went to school everyday even in 11‚Äì12th (and I had nearly 100% attendance) and still did well.

Age of Empires 4,Why don't Indian parents allow their children to play video games?,"As a parent, I do not let my daughter play video games that much.

Her mom restricted because she thinks my daughter spends too much time. I restricted it because it is embarrassing to see my daughter considering these stuff as ‚Äúgames‚Äù.

Tech Scalpers,What was the pinnacle of the 2000s?,"I was starting my DJ career in the early 2000's and looking back I think 2005 was the peak of creativity for the decade. Hip hop had gotten stale in the late 90's, but some creative remixes and collabos were now happening, Timbaland was just hitting hit solo career stride, Kanye, Lil'Jon, Ying Yang twins, 50 cent,Eminem and D12,Three-Six Mafia,Snoop, Ice Cube were all killing it on the hip hop side, Flo-Rida was the new kid on the block about to dominate the rest of the decade. Acts like Usher (huge comeback) Chris Brown, Akon, and Black Eyed peas were blurring the line between RnB, Hip Hop and Electro. Lady Gaga wasn't a household name yet, but was starting to put together her first group of original songs that would become her first album, Kesha was a backup dancer for Flo-Rida still,but had begun her step towards solo stardom. The air was ripe with creativity and fresh sounds were happening every couple months. Justice‚Äô was about to blow people's minds with a glitch/tech album. Metal was in full stride with the Ozzfest and Gigantour crowds, Black label society, Lamb of God, System of a down, Killswitch engage, Hatebreed,Dream Theatre and As I lay Dying were putting out iconic albums of the era and performing legendary live shows. Dimebag Darrell (formerly of Pantera,who had broken up) was shot dead on stage while performing with Damageplan ,a loss that is still felt today and led to Zakk Wylde writing ‚ÄòIn this River‚Äô in his honor. Screamo was relatively new and bands like Atreyu, Underoath, Silverstein, and 18 Visions were leading an army of warped tour bands around the country performing to throngs of eager new ears. The Killers, Jack Johnson, Sia, the Used, Yeah yeah yeahs, Bloc Party, Coheed and Cambria, Nine inch nails, Coldplay, Bright eyes, Between the buried and me, and so many other acts were putting out their career defining or pinnacle albums or touring in support of them. There was a singer-songwriter mini revival wave with minimalistic feel artists like Sara Bareilles, Feist, and a slew of others that mostly had one hit song. The Foo fighter's released a double album with one cd being mostly quietish acoustic fare. Dance music had begun shifting towards tech-house and big bass as well as a disco-funk remix revival, but Electro-pop was the real game changer IMO, dirty fuzzy bass lines and bass synths were throbbing on dance floors everywhere, the year of the Mashup might have been 2005, throwing things like Skee-lo together with Franz Ferdinand were not too far fetched to imagine hearing in a set then. We did not Imagine the wave of American Dubstep we were about to experience. Bassnectar was about to morph his sound and Pretty lights was on the verge of blurring DJ-ing with scratch remixing, sampling, and live original performances, also the best light shows of this century. You can't really talk about music in 2005 without mentioning MySpace.Before Facebook, MySpace was the place bands and indie musicians put their best foot forward and many songs were either available with streaming or free download. Exclusive live performances could be streamed for probably the first time on the internet in a really organized manner, with virtual tickets given to fans for signing up for email updates etc. Bands also sold real tickets on MySpace which ensured real fans got a majority of the seats instead of shithead scalpers. (The fact we've regressed back to a corrupt ticket system is just more evidence of a moral failure at the highest levels in our music industry.) MySpace even sponsored several music festivals and had PC stations present to ‚Äúcheck your myspace‚Äù ,which actually was a great new way to network ( or hook up) for young people. I remember regretting not having a way to upload my 240x360 pictures from my Nokia slider phone to my MySpace page while I was at a Nine inch Nails show. Nobody had data plans back then, or if you did, Data wasn't available the kind of remote places outdoor concerts were held. You were lucky to get texts! There were some things 2005 lacked, like HDTV, Megapixel camera phones, Mobile high speed internet, and Pandora. But we still had MTV 2, Revolver Magazine, Warped tour, Ozzfest, Cd's ,Tower records , and all the things that went along with those that soon disappeared when we got all that new stuff was a step backwards in the music industry in many ways IMO. Just Google ‚Äúrock albums 2005 ‚Äú and browse through the first hundred listings, there's so much great stuff you'll need a week to get through it all.",https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-pinnacle-of-the-2000s,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,Is the Nintendo Switch Mini too soon?,"Edit: Ah. It has come to my attention that the Switch Mini is actually a rumored version of the Switch that is literally just a smaller one, and not like the previous Minis Nintendo has sold. I did not know this at the time of writing. So I stand corrected. Nevertheless, I spent all this time writing this article, so here it shall remain. Are you joking? You must be joking. You have to be. Of course it is too soon to be selling a Switch Mini! The Switch is still being sold; it's not even in the prime of its shelf life yet and you're asking if it's too soon to start thinking about Switch Minis? Alright, let's go through the fine print, shall we? What's the purpose of a mini? Most people might say that it's there to give people a taste of the old classics, a cheap option to play the games of their childhoods and to pass on such joy to their offspring and significant others. And that's certainly true. From the consumers' point of view. But it's not the reason they exist. [Insert Console Here] Minis exist for one purpose and one purpose only:  to make Nintendo buttloads of money . Literally no other reason. Did you see those things when they first went on sale? Of course you didn't, because you didn't get there until after the first fifteen minutes where they completely sold out of those tiny little frakkers. Granted, scalpers didn't help much, but neither did Nintendo. They have a wonderful habit of understocking their products to shoot up the demand. See the Wii in 2006, when they weren't on store shelves for 6 months. Or various Amiibo in regions where they were popular. Or the Minis. And even now as the NES and even the SNES Minis come back in stock in  SSSSLLLLOOOOOWWWW  intervals, those ones get bought up pretty quickly‚Äîat least, where I get my video game products. Nintendo is very good at making money. And they darn well should be! It's the only way to not only survive in the cutthroat industry that is video games, but  thrive  in it, much like Nintendo is doing. They don't want to be the next Sega. So why sell an outdated console? Well, they know that our nostalgia has our wallets by the gonads. They know that they can make us pay $80 for a bunch of games no one buys anymore. It's super cheap to make these things, too. Literally load ROMs onto the emulator they designed (yes, they technically are pirating their own games), encase it in nostalgic-looking plastic, and then ship it off for $80 a pop. They make a 200% return on this thing. Old games are the gift that keeps on giving. Do you know how many copies of Super Mario World I own? 7. Two actual SNES copies (one I had at my dad's, one at my mom's), one Wii copy, one Wii U copy, one emulated copy on my computer, one emulated copy on my phone, and one emulated copy on my SNES Mini. Did I miss any? I don't think so‚Ä¶ 5 of the 7 games I bought. I have literally bought Super Mario World 5 times. On me alone, they have 5 times the return on investment. Hot diggity dog. Another reason they sell an outdated console is because they are no longer being sold. They're not making any money off of their old products. Why? To some, that's just a careless shrug that can be explained by the march of progress. To Nintendo, it's a missed opportunity to make even more money. And it works‚Äîhook, line, and sinker. The Switch is still in circulation‚Äîthey‚Äôre still even making Wii games (well‚Ä¶ does the new Just Dance even count anymore?). If they're still making games for a console, there's no reason to be selling a Mini version of it. There's no nostalgia. They're still making money on their old games. They're still getting something out of the console. Nintendo is getting literally nothing out of the SNES, the NES, the N64‚Äîheck, the GameCube is even completely out of circulation now. Dang, I'm old. There's no reason to make a Mini for anything beyond the Wii because it won't sell optimally like the other previous Minis. And at the end of the day, it's all about what will sell optimally. Seriously, take a look at a Switch Mini. How much money is Nintendo going to lose on a Switch Mini? First, it's going to cost a lot more to make. We can emulate NES games with ease on pretty much any piece of garbage tech you can find at your local Best Buy. What you can't emulate easily is Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch. It's a lot more complex than sprites on a screen. I tried emulating Mario Kart: Double Dash on my decent PC right once. That game was slower than dirt at trying to emulate everything. I tried so hard because it's my favorite Mario Kart to date, but alas, it just can't run smoothly on my modern computer, much to my dismay. Other GameCube games work nicely though. Luigi's Mansion and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door work wonders. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, not so much. Not that I needed to anyway, because I owned the Trilogy on my Wii. So if you take a Switch and try to put it in a Mini form, you're going to have trouble emulating the games on it. Especially if it's cheap like the other Minis. Secondly, Nintendo is going to lose out on the retail value of the games inside. The games you would want on a Switch have a retail value of $60, without the DLC and/or expansion that comes with each game. Just one game installed on it, without any DLC bundled with it, plus the manufacturing of the Mini console itself, is going to leave VERY little margin for profit for Nintendo. Very little. Not like previous Minis that make them their third gold -lined swimming pool in their back yard (or, I guess in Tokyo, rent for a one-room apartment). But you're going to want at least 10 on there for nostalgia purposes, right? If you can even call it nostalgia since the games are still very much in circulation? And do we even  have  10 games that we can call the classics on the Switch? Let alone 20, like on the previous Minis? You know how much money Nintendo is losing on one mini alone? We're talking a thousand dollars,  per Mini , here. That is the  opposite  of good business practice. And that's what it all comes down to: how much money they can make. A Switch Mini would lose them so much money there would be no point to marketing the actual Switch at that point.",https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Nintendo-Switch-Mini-too-soon,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,Why is the name Amazon used by Jeff Bezos?,"Jeff Bezos first named the company as  Cadabra,  after the magic slogan ‚ÄúAbra-Cadabra‚Äù. When he first mentioned this to his lawyer over the phone, his lawyer misheard it as ‚ÄúCadaver ???‚Äù . Bezos knew right then, that the name would not stick. Bezos had the customer-centric approach to the business, right from the start. So, he had proposed to change the name to ‚ÄúRelentless Inc‚Äù, a way of saying that the company would be relentless in its approach to customer satisfaction. In 1994, the company‚Äôs then de-facto CTO was Shel Kaphan. He was not very amused by the proposal. So, Bezos continued to look for options for the company name. In the 1990s, the number of websites were finite, and countable by humans. The websites were sorted alphabetically on the ‚Äúinternet directory‚Äù of those days. After a bunch of research, Bezos settled on  Amazon Inc  for two reasons - Amazon river has the largest collection of flora and fauna in the world.  Amazon Inc  will represent the largest collection of retail items on the internet Amazon-dot-com will appear in the first pages of the internet directory, making it easier to attract users and customers.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-name-Amazon-used-by-Jeff-Bezos,"I‚Äôve always wondered about this and recall the ads from the early days, with the old ‚Äúecho-sounding voice‚Äù as if speaking from inside the world‚Äôs largest warehouse.","To elaborate, that ‚Äúinternet directory‚Äù was Yahoo.

Jeff Bezos,Was what Jeff Bezos said about the Falcon 9 landing fair?,"The SpaceX Orbcomm OG2 mission was a real world mission with a paying customer. However it was a light mission, with just 2.5 tons of total payload (including the payload adapter and the mass simulator to keep the whole system mass balanced). In comparison there's an upcoming SES-9 launch with will launch a 5.3 ton (at launch) satellite into a GTO orbit. The OG2 mission was a 620Km ish orbit, while a usual GTO orbit is 35700Km x 180Km (several times the energy). But of course, Blue Origin launch was a joke in comparison with any SpaceX launch mission, it's a puny rocket (half the height of the first, about 10% of thrust, no 2nd stage), and SpaceX did it in a real world launch with a paying customer instead of a Blue Origin taped mission that the outside world only saw after it was all perfect. I look forward when SpaceX will have a lighter GTO launch to demonstrate the full boostback with a significant delta V mission (the SES-9 launch will land at the ASDS-drone ship or not at all). Anyhow, that's not a real problem. SpaceX should launch its Falcon Heavy for the first time in 2016 and its much higher performance should allow all its center stage and two side boosters to land back on the launch pad even with the largest GEO commercial satellites devised. But recovering the stage is just the first step, it needs to be tested and checked and relaunched, eventually achieving routine and safe relaunch. There are still 1-2 years of work ahead. SpaceX also needs to demontrate that this wasn't a lucky shot and recover the vast majority of the boosters they launch.",https://www.quora.com/Was-what-Jeff-Bezos-said-about-the-Falcon-9-landing-fair,Outstanding comment,,,,
Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos an evil person?,"Is Jeff Bezos an evil person? The most extreme man on earth screwed me over. Furthermore, me, yet a large number, if not millions, of people far and wide. If you haven't thought about the Amazon Associates part program, it's a course for destinations to get paid for recommending Amazon things. Right when people make an affirmed purchase by tapping on a part associate, the site obtains a commission on the arrangement.  I don't consider various strengths, anyway I understand that many pet locales are financed basically, if not inside and out, by those commissions. How might I know this? I'm an autonomous creator, and the principle some portion of my work is in the pet strength. Today, Amazon let their accomplices understand that they are changing the commission rates. Pets things used to pay 8% commission. That will be dropping to 3%. That suggests locales that suffer fundamentally on commissions from Amazon will lose MORE THAN HALF of their compensation. I've recently lost most likely the best client, and doubtlessly I will lose another. I'm emphatically waging war to get altogether more work in my fundamental forte. Precisely how enormous is the Amazon Associates program? Beginning in 2018, there were up to 1,000,000 destinations related to the program. Just Amazon knows the authentic numbers, anyway most would concur this will impact incalculable people clearly, through lost pay, and a huge number of extra people by suggestion, considering the way that those locales won't have the choice to remain to pay writers or SEO experts anymore. ""Thoughtful, in fact, all associations are downsizing the current second,"" you may be thinking. Jeff Bezos is the only one of the world's five most excessive people who hasn't lost money in 2020. Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon, is the most lavish man on earth. Additionally, he plainly picked he needs to eliminate more money from the pockets of committed people the world over who've been propelling Amazon things. It's hard to imagine a more destroyed circumstance. I can't begin to imagine the number of people's employments that man has as of late squashed. In a perfect world, I can find clients with various claims to fame. Nonetheless, the clients I'm losing? One has experienced the latest serious drawn-out period of time fabricating a productive canine site sponsored basically by the Amazon Associates program. He was by then losing money since people haven't been buying as much stuff due to the economy. By and by? He's totally screwed. I'm perturbed by overabundance right now. I'm sure I'll get a ton of comments about how it was a quick business decision or something. I was unable to mindless. I basically ought to be angry as of now.  Really. Jeff Bezos IS a wicked and horrifying person. Amazon's framework has been to annihilate Mom and Pop stores, close by region stores, pound all book shops (beforehand remarkable spots for people to loosen up and meet various savants). By then, he lifts costs and diminishes his quality on Amazon. Today was told, straight-stood up to, that three things sold on Amazon and recorded as 'in stock' would require FOUR DAYS to pass on by methods for Prime, anyway that they are 'multi-day Prime movement.' Spend 30 minutes being dicked around and scorned by Indian ""Customer help Representatives"" who read off a substance and sat inert, by then an extra 15 minutes with a CSR in the Philippines who was, at any rate, thoughtful, yet could sit inactively. 100 BILLION dollars? There should be NO transients in the USA with such money. He could tolerate opening safe houses and dealing with stations in each critical city. He is a nauseating, enormous, noxious twitch. A money adoring pig Do you expect someone additionally to have the alternative to truly make billions without obliterating various social order lives? He has executed such innumerable people it is inconceivable. By and by, SURELY there will be who state he hasn't butchered anyone. They also secure Hitler since Hitler didn't execute anyone. Boss' are swindled. They envision they are heavenly creatures, pharaohs, rulers, aces, etc Right? Or of course, would they say they are essentially farm owners who have a lot of slaves? What number of slaves does Bezos have? It's downright self-evident, these psychological cases figure out some approach to control people and the money structure to benefit themselves. They form a genuine perspective of homicide people, not clearly, yet in an indirect way. By far most are unnecessarily careless in regards to grasping the complexities anyway many are so pretentious and bonehead that they can't comprehend that their wealth was made precisely by taking it from someone else. He didn't do this persuasively or clearly anyway by control. He either paid his slaves less or just took from others through money related contriving. It couldn't be any more self-evident, Bezos didn't make a considerable amount of anything. People, LOT'S of people made. It Bezos made Amazon much like the Pharaohs made pyramids‚Ä¶ that is, they got others to do it and paid them scraps with the overwhelming plan of action money and risks of violence. By far most need to legitimize Bezos because they should be a lot of equivalent to him. They should be a specialist with a tremendous farm and the ability to do anything. Our overall population programs youths to pursue money and have the ""American Dream"". It's all just one more sort of coercion. People will examine the sum he achieved for society and such bologna as he truly did anything. It basically goes to show you how insane they are and how they ignore the 10's of thousands of people who truly refined all the work. It looks like Bill doors, how he did very little(he probably did more than Bezos) considering the way that it was the 10's of thousands of slaves that gathered the association into what it is. They didn't become Billionaires some alternate way. It's really like hailing the master of the bequest for all the creation that was done and for working the hostages where it counts. These men are not holy people, not heavenly creatures, not wonders. many are truly despicable. A couple is essentially persevering representatives and acquired by, surely, the free undertaking enslavement structure. Close to the day's end, nonetheless, their plenitude has hurt society. There are such incalculable dejected people who persevere. Our overall population denounces needy individuals, yet they are poor deliberately. So various desperate. Such endless cleared out people. All that money that Bezos and his sort have could be used to help society, anyway, it's only for them to make their awful void lives critical, by chance. These people have minimal worth. Eliminate their money and no one would mind a tiny smidgen about them. At last, they are just impressions of a contaminated society where people consider each to be an individual as prey. In Bezos's mind it's reliably about the sum he can get from you, nothing else. There is nothing more to him. It's inauspicious. It looks like a whore, she'll never experience veritable love since love to her is sex a ton is paid for. The inspiration driving why it is awful is that these are the people that certainly can achieve a particularly extraordinary arrangement incredible on the planet and changes things yet moreover are effectively the purpose behind the issues of the universe.

TWO nations with a joined people of 75 million people don't have as much money as ONE MAN. Undoubtedly, I feel that is an extraordinary arrangement for one individual to have! Nevertheless, hi, uncommon for him, right? Private endeavor, you know?! Ask yourself: how might you get that rich? Since each person who works at Amazon is depleted and missed the mark.

Jeff Bezos,What kind of phone does Jeff Bezos use?,"I was sitting outside in a courtyard in Princeton.  I was writing some emails to set up meetings in New York.   I was planning on going to New York the following week.   Mid-email, for no apparent reason, I had this impulsive urge to take the train to New York.  I had to go now, take the very next train at 1p.m.  Why? I'm not sure, but I had nothing else planned mid-week so I grabbed my backpack and ran over. The next train left just a few minutes later, but I reached the train breathless barely in time.  I bought my ticket and jumped aboard.  I took a few deep breaths because I was still tired and looked around.  I saw Jeff Bezos. A brief side story: I love Amazon.  I've known it for years and I put all of my savings into Amazon stock.  I've hosted my blog on Amazon EC2 for the past 6 years. It's given me exceptional returns for the past half decade, and I expect that to continue.  Amazon owns online commerce, digital sales, and they basically run the Internet.  Quora, Zynga, Netflix, Dropbox, Eventbrite, etc all run on AWS and most investors still don't understand how computing as a service is going to be a huge business.  Jeff Bezos is one of my business heroes. He was valedictorian of my high school in Miami. He studied CS at Princeton.  He worked at a hedge fund and created an amazing company. He has an extremely long term view of his company.  Even as he started Amazon as a book store, he could see how it would become a commerce powerhouse and, now, is literally running swathes of the Internet. I'm very excited about the impact he will have on the world in the coming decades. I talked to him about some of this, and about my thesis work.

Jeff Bezos,Are Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos rivals?,"Without a doubt. Anyone who has been following tech news knows that Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are rivals.  Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are two of the most influential men in the world, due in part to their statuses as the CEOs of numerous multi-billion dollar companies. They are both revolutionizing our modern world, Bezos through Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce empire and Musk through the fledgling Tesla‚Äôs mission for sustainability. However, Amazon and Tesla aren‚Äôt the two enterprises that are competing with one another. You can make the argument that Amazon drones could compete with Tesla to provide shipping services, but these‚Ä¶  ‚Ä¶are never going to compete with these‚Ä¶  We all know where these two billionaires are really clashing, and it‚Äôs not even on this planet. Ladies and gentlemen, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos have two of the most impressive pet projects in the industry: SpaceX and Blue Origin.  Both companies are taking humanity to the stars. Although their current goals seem to differ, SpaceX is bent on colonizing Mars and Blue Origin is prioritizing space tourism efforts, they will be competing to become humanity‚Äôs dominant launch service. It‚Äôs peculiar to see the two men competing in the aerospace industry, particularly because both of them started their respective companies to live a childhood dream. Musk was an avid reader of science fiction, such as  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy , and Jeff Bezos was another science fiction fan, being a devoted fan to shows like  Star Trek.  (Trust me, both are  really  good)  Currently, the two companies are aiming for goals which put them on radically different trajectories. However, both ventures have been mentioned as key players in the revived race to colonize the cosmos. Will we live to see which side prevails? Unfortunately, we probably won‚Äôt. However, the two companies are making great leaps of progress for the future of space exploration. My generation will likely witness a broadcast of the first humans to step on Mars, and could very well partake in the colonization of the Red Planet. I am excited to see where SpaceX and Blue Origin take us.

Jeff Bezos,What is Jeff Bezos' leadership style?,"Leadership plays a vital role in creating healthy and sustainable organization. So, let‚Äôs have a look at the Jeff Bezos‚Äô Leadership Style.

 Bezos as a transactional leader:  If you observe, then you will find Bezos is a task-oriented transactional leader. If we go by definition, transactional leader is one with rigorous benchmarks who is often uninterested in other people‚Äôs opinions. It is one of the best style because it is in the best interest of subordinates to do what exactly the leader wants. It is an effective style to achieve operational goals and outcomes and creating business opportunities that thrive in the era of global competition.  So, we can say, his leadership style is transactional.  Bezos as a transformational leader:  In addition to the transactional leadership qualities, the executive of Amazon can also be termed as an agent of change who seeks innovation. By definition, transformation leader is one who produces great results and delivers follower creativity. A transformational leader always known for creating a fascinating vision of the future which influences the mind and heart of people positively. So, if we observe, then we find that Bezos believes in linking his company‚Äôs long term goals to the people‚Äôs values and created an interest and commitment to act on the vision driving team efforts beyond ordinary possibilities. It can be seen from the growth of the company- Amazon which is the result of his ability to envision, inspire and innovate even when others didn‚Äôt believe in his vision.  Conclusion:  The executive of Amazon is a task oriented, transactional and transformational leader. Under his leadership, Amazon created a success story in terms of revenue, sales and stock price analysis. But, still need to work on major parts like working environment and listening people‚Äôs opinions too. So, there is an area of improvement for Bezos. He needs to coordinate his two basic leadership style to gain the best results.

On the other hand, and again to me, ‚ÄúSwiss chocolate‚Äù, the one I miss when I am away from home, is that:  Tablets . 100 grams of dark chocolate, or milk chocolate, with or without nuts, hazelnuts, or almonds, or even white chocolate (which is not really chocolate but which I love). I‚Äôd even say that to me and to a lot of other men in Switzerland (and some women), the quintessential chocolate is this:  Not the red tablet, but the ‚Äúhalf emergency ration‚Äù in the white package. That was what the army gave us. It was dark, but sort of creamy, and we ate tons when in military service periods. The army now seems not to give it out as freely or even to have run out of it entirely, sadly. To answer your question, I can‚Äôt honestly say which is the best. I just know which I prefer. And I‚Äôd like to ring an alarm bell here: both are endangered. Endangered by commercial rules that tend to make it ‚Äúprotectionnist‚Äù and thus increasingly illegal to demand that chocolate does not contain anything else than sugar, milk, and cocoa butter (which makes white chocolate officially chocolate although it has no trace of cocoa in it), plus the obvious cocoa for taste and colour. Some do add other fats than cocoa butter, such as palm oil. I don‚Äôt want it in my chocolate. Away with that stuff!

Swiss Chocolate,How did the Swiss come to develop some of the world's best chocolate?,"Great milk. Great attention to detail. And, above all else, a very world-savvy populace that spoke the languages of most any other European country and was adept in trading and acquisition. The Swiss didn't have to go and colonize. All they had to do was ask the colonial powers for stuff. It's why herbs and spices made it so rapidly into Swiss food - French chefs (this will get me yelled at again :) who had and have nothing on their Swiss counterparts came to Switzerland to learn and brought it with them. Chocolate started to be processed in the late 17th century in the very south, an area called Ticino, which is one half of Italian Switzerland. Ticino had a huge influx of spices and other materials from Italy which, in turn, traded for wines and beers made in Switzerland. One of the most famous first chocolate makers in the world was Suchard in French Switzerland who started in the mid-19th century with materials imported from France. The reason was simple - it's easier to transport the relatively stable cocoa bean to the best milk than carting milk, which spoils easily, to the cocoa importers. Suchard was bought and made unmemorable by Kraft Foods. In the 1830s a confissiere by the name of Spruengli and a chocolate maker by the name of Lindt started to work together to sell chocolate to the rest of Europe. The French lapped it up, Germans too. 1900 marks the year that Tobler began making the Toblerone bar. Today's Toblerone is owned, surprise, by Kraft Foods and a piece of crap compared to what it was for the first 100 years. Through all this, even through WWI and II, Switzerland was  the  hub for anything coming north from the colonies. Just look at this picture:
Switzerland is the red spot wedged between Italy in the south, where most spices (chocolate was long, long, considered a spice) arrived, Germany and France who consumed most of it, and Bohemia and Austria-Hungary which had huge, and very rich, royal families.  In between is unassuming Switzerland who just happen to be at the right spot, have the best milk, the clearest water, and the best cooks and confissieres in the world. So instead of carting all that cocoa all the way to France, even the French kings made the Swiss do the work.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Swiss-come-to-develop-some-of-the-worlds-best-chocolate,didn't know that Toblerone had changed... you say that should have been around 2000?,"But arguably the ""best"" Swiss chocolate is black/dark, and thus doesn't have a  whole lot of milk in it.

In the world of craft chocolate, there is a clear focus on dark chocolate, with no ingredients other than cocoa and sugar in most cases.

Swiss Chocolate,"What are the differences between Belgian, Swiss, and German chocolate?","Technically there is little difference, all are processed in the same way. There are, however, diff drenches between individual manufacturers‚Äô chocolate and traditionally, it is the chocolate that has been conched and refined most that is considered highest quality. Conching is a process of slowly stirring or turning the chocolate with paddles whilst introducing heat gently. The more chocolate is conched, the more developed its characteristic taste and smell become and the better it‚Äôs texture, since this process emulsifiers the liquid and the sugars with the cocoa butter and removes acid (lactose). Refining is usually the next process and this filters out the coarser sugars, leaving the final product smooth, fine and less grainy. Americans, take note, it is the fact that it is only minimally subjected to conching and not refined at all that causes many Europeans to consider Hersheys, the ubiquitous brand in the USA, chocolate flavored candy rather than real chocolate. Hershey‚Äôs is distinctly grainy in comparison to any European brand. All European brands undergo both conching and refining processes. Many are continuously conched, refined, reconched and re-refined to produce their distinctive, smooth creamy texture and taste. As to which country‚Äôs is best, it‚Äôs really up to personal preference, as is your choice of dark or milk. Personally, I prefer German milk chocolate, but experts ratings are based on dark, semi-sweet varieties. Belgium and Switzerland have both alternately held the reputation for producing the finest chocolate in the world. I wouldn‚Äôt know or want to rate though.

Look at the per capita income of India's median age population. Working to earn is not an option here. It is simply because people do not have any choice. Everyone wants to do good for the society but one doesn't has the financial support or background to be a politician. Look at Modi or Vajpayee. Though they did receive success, but it was when they turned old . I am pretty sure that when they were young they went through a lot of financial difficulties. I am pretty sure that if you ensure a salary of 20k or 30k for an individual, many people would come and join politics. Every passion that you undertake has to be followed by some sort of financial success or support to at least ensure your family's well being and health. If politics cannot provide that, then joining it isn't an option.",Your point is very good but I just want to ask one thing. I have no godfather in politics nor do people around me know ‚Äúwho I am‚Äù(except from my village). Then How do I enter into the politics?Why would people choose me over the Reputed parties.I'm not a familiar face to them at the end of the day.

I was thinking the same thing.,,,,
Tech Scalpers,What will the gaming industry be like in 2025?,"I think by 2025, depending on the pandemic, things might look very different for the tech and even the gaming industry; Cloud gaming:  With 5G on the rise and as more and more phones begin to gain said technology, add that with the scalpers/mining trend taking over PC gaming, more and more people would eventually look up to xCloud, Amazon Luna, and other streaming services. While the EU has cheaper cellular plans, its twice as dense compared to the US, Canada, or even Australia, and there are some parts of the EU that don‚Äôt have fast internet, yet. Keep in mind that cellular nodes have to handle dozens of connections at once without dropping/breaking. Augmented reality:  With Apple‚Äôs 8K AR headset on the way, and being one of the first handhelds to sport a MicroLED display, we could see AR headsets and games to add a new layer within the real world as well. I think this trend might be a hit-or-miss, though because not many people care about augmented reality yet. PC Gaming:  With Apple Silicon crushing x86 at best (the M1X on the new iMac could crush AMD Ryzen as well and there‚Äôs a new AMD+Exynos chip on the way that is said to outperform the A14), we‚Äôre getting to the point where ARM is on its way to outperforming the bloated x86 architecture, and with Nvidia buying Arm, we could see Nvidia GPUs inside the Qualcomm Snapdragon or the Tegra making a return to smartphones as well. There is a new architecture on the way called RISC-V, which is open-source and is royalty-free, and lots of companies like Google are also jumping onto it as well. Computers might look very different by then. Its worth noting that IBM‚Äôs PowerPC is related to ARM, as they are both RISC-based processors, as opposed to CISC on the x86. I think sooner or later AMD would give up on x86 and focus on ARM/RISC-V. Nintendo Switch is using a Tegra, and they got a port of Witcher 3 & even Crysis working on that console as well, if you really want to know the limits of the Tegra X1, while Xbox/PlayStation are sitting at the x86 land doing nothing to innovate console gaming. MicroLED:  One of the more infamous reasons of OLED TVs being more expensive & difficult to produce is because of the color filter, which causes more defects than normal, but since QD-OLED (Quantom Dot OLED) has Samsung and it doesn‚Äôt have a color filter, it could be easier to mass produce and become cheaper quicker. The new technology is called MicroLED, which is OLED without the burn-in, and the highest color brightness ever recorded. We already got a glimpse of the smallest MicroLED TV, which is 75 inches. I think in 5 years, Samsung would produce more and more MicroLED TVs and stop LCD production altogether. Add that with Samsung backing down from OLED TVs because they didn‚Äôt even have the same technology that LG had; W-OLED TVs. They‚Äôre making smaller OLED TVs, and some PC gamers use them like an OLED monitor. We could also see the first TV to ditch the HDMI port and go completely wireless or with its own smaller connector to increase the thinness even more, maybe USB type D with a round square connector. An innovation that I want to see on future TVs/phones is making the glass immune to sunlight/reflections, like the Pro Display XDR, which might also be in future Tesla cars as well. Batteries:  They‚Äôre innovating on the lithium-ion batteries by introducing a new form of battery called graphene battery, which improves on the size (the largest part of any phone circuit board is the battery) Xiaomi is also rolling out a ranged wireless charger, which is basically a charger that uses waves to charge your phone from a distance, which if this technology gets better and better, Apple might be getting close to removing the charging port from the next big iPhone and advertising their ranged wireless charger as well. The end of consoles:  With a mobile market that‚Äôs too big to fail (1 billion smartphones vs 50 million console sales), its no wonder mobile gaming is too popular to even fail. I think in the future, game consoles might go the way of the cloud with xCloud on the rise as well. Apple has its own Apple Arcade, which you can play on any device. At this point, its a mixed bag. With all three consoles having paid online multiplayer and tons of microtransaction trends, some people might end up giving up on gaming as well (considering that many parents consider it worse than watching something on Disney+), considering that games are actually much more difficult to produce than say movies or TV shows, where you just need to put together scenes with the actors.",https://www.quora.com/What-will-the-gaming-industry-be-like-in-2025,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,"How is the social life and typical lifestyle in China among different sections of people? How does an average Chinese feel in his/her family, job, and society? What is a reality that cannot be captured in articles/news, but only by a personal story?","1.The squaredancemaniac and ‚Äúdama‚Äù phobia. The ubiquity of the square dance groups is antagonizing the residents who think that these incorrigible retirees crowding the square or the gardens after dinner are encroaching on their rights to lead a quite and peaceful life in the community. Unable to bar them from doing so, the local residents avenge the conflict through extreme behaviors: some poured fetid excrement from upstairs to silence the crowd, while others scolded them by themselves. But, regardless of the measures, most of the aunties remain steadfast in their habits. As a result, a plethora of confrontations and manslaughters were reported. Last year, when a family couldn‚Äôt endure the noise, they went downstairs to argue with those scrappy members of the group. Terrified by the violent reaction and the virulent remarks of those feisty elders, the husband passed out abruptly in the course of the argument. He was found to die of the heart attack, thereupon his wife filed a civil lawsuit against those participants. With two kids leaning on the wage of her husband, his death might take a heavy toll on the destiny of this family.  This was not the most radical case though. In another case, a man slit the square dance member‚Äôs throat after their conflict. There are some elderly exercise junkies who are keen to march or jog in lockstep along the roadways. This fanaticism of strutting along the road in orderly groups has triggered controversy since they have menaced the security of public. In 2017, 3 members were hit by a taxi running into the crowd, with one death and two injuries.  To some, the square dance is a lucrative business. In the midst of the retirees, there are some effusive young males with ulterior motive, who are relentlessly offering the elders with small gifts to lure them into purchasing the financial products from the community banks, whose client base are mainly composed of the pensioners. These elderly people‚Äôs incomes are sometimes on a par with those of the white-collars, so some shelled out more than a million RMB. In some cases, certain bank managers even deluded the elders into buying their products with the alleged ‚Äúfree‚Äù package tours. It was not until they arrived at HK that the penny dropped: each elder was coerced into spending at least 50,000 RMB on the financial product. Besides those banks, such activities bring dividends to the shrewd organizers as well, who can take commissions on the sales they make from buying the gears and outfits on the e-commerce apps in bulk. Once the troupe become well-known, the leader can readily make over 500,000 for just one performance with over 1000 people. Early this year, Taobao recruited elders aged over 60 to experience its products aimed at elderly consumers and offer feedbacks, by offering a yearly income of 400,000. One applicant is the KOL of several square dance groups, who can urge a cohort of aged 60 plus to buy more merchandises. When the current trade war slackens the speed of the economy, the silvery industry can counter the bleak prospect to some extent. In my opinion, the exercises per se are not problems. After all, they can deflect the attention of the elders from the maudlin stories of their beloved ones. For example, my mom used to be grief-stricken after my relatives‚Äô death and couldn't blot out the scenes in the hospital. So, I encouraged her to while away her time with her high school classmates, and pamper herself in the frequent get-togethers with them. In this case, I have empathy with those retirees at my moms‚Äô age, who need activities to prevent themselves from developing Alzheimer and friends to help them abstain from the unhealthy lifestyles. But, it is also imperative that the government should define the obligations of those groups and segregate them from the local residents to keep the noise and conflicts at bay. 2. The Chinese fever of Marathon Yesterday my city saw an International marathon with a record high of 28,000 people participating in the long distance events.  Nowadays, marathons have become a fad in China teeming with the middle class who regard the marathons as palliates to fill the void in their hearts, and to share their intransigent attitudes towards their lives with friends, which are fraught with issues known as ‚Äúthe midlife crisis‚Äù: the inadequate feeling due to the inevitable mortality, and the anxiety about the job losses or failure of the start-ups in the wake of another round of recession. This kind of crisis, according to the online analysis I‚Äôve pored over, would yield the desire to achieve youthfulness or to make drastic changes to current lifestyle. In the past, the financially well-off tended to resort to hedonism for a brief respite from their taxing jobs when they reach their 40s. But now, with the educational level progressively raised among the upper-middle class, they direct their attention at something different, which can help them exude an air of confidence and fitness to face up to more challenges in life and work. So, when it comes down to it, marathon is used as a red herring for those middle-aged who are in dire need of the confidence deriving from overcoming something seemingly insurmountable to regain the veneration from people around them. As a result, many scalpers made a fortune by selling the quotas of the Beijing Marathon at the price of 1000 to 1500 yuan, almost 5 to 7 times the original price. Another thing warranting attention is how this pomp has become a profitable business for some agents. Akin to the competitions in the US, the contestants from Ethiopia and Kenya swept the medals, under the auspices of their Chinese agents. The picture from yesterday‚Äôs marathon. As you can see, the champion is a Chinese, who is a professional runner while the rest of the winners are all African girls whose agents are probably Chinese taking commissions from the prizes they win.  3. Life on the road The HRs are bemoaning the half-hearted attitude of the young employees who are slated to go AWOL when they are bored stiff by the grueling 996 working schedule in the tech companies: the workday starts at 9am, finishing at 9pm, with an extended 6-day workweek. Abhorring the sycophants bending to the supervisor‚Äôs will and the mad scramble for the resources, the youngsters in China are apt to refashion their lives and careers through starting up their own business. In a consumerist society, they believe pampering oneself is not only justifiable but also likely to turn a lucrative business. As a result, the social media is full of a plethora of young globe trotters blurring the distinction between work and life, who can make both ends meet either by the adverts of their channels or the income based on the hits of their videos. Monetizing their popularity and having a large fan base over a million can be realized within months, but not everyone can become Internet celebrities. Some one-dimensional videos with half-baked plans have inflicted financial losses on those who have promptly quit their jobs once they saw others profiting from making videos on the social apps. Besides the soul-searching hitchhikers who appeal to their fans merely through the exotic episodes, I reeled from the videos made by some adventurers whose boldness and aptitudes for new skills distinguish themselves from others. For instance, Liang Hong and Zhang Xin Yu are a couple from Beijing who are renowned for their adventures around the globe. Unlike the other globe trotters, the meticulous spouse devoted 5 years to laying out their itineraries and garnering certificates needed on their trips, while making a budget of 100 million with the fixed asset they built up in their own right. The Chinese urbanites are glued to their videos because the two doers remained self-possessed in the war-torn regions. With Mercedes pumping money into their third season, they are able to have a group of 10 people providing the logistics and operating the gears. Consequently, they accomplished something even more unimaginable: reviving the giant pre-Islamic Buddha statues carved into cliffs in Bamiyan province 2000 years ago that has been destroyed by the Taliban, which believed that the statue was an insult to Islam. When the image they trawled from the Internet was projected onto the derelict remains, some locals gazed awestruck at the 175-foot statue with tears.  But this practice has triggered provocation from the Taliban, which warned them of the abduction. As a veteran from Chinese army, Zhang didn‚Äôt flinch from the potential retaliation, and continued their trip in the uproar.",https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-social-life-and-typical-lifestyle-in-China-among-different-sections-of-people-How-does-an-average-Chinese-feel-in-his-her-family-job-and-society-What-is-a-reality-that-cannot-be-captured-in-articles-news-but-only-by-a-personal-story,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,Why is Supreme so overhyped and overpriced?," Here‚Äôs some insight into the brand Supreme from someone who is intimately familiar with the garments they make‚Ä¶ From:  8 Reasons Why Supreme Just Sucks ‚Äî You heard me right the first time, and I‚Äôll say it again.  Supreme sucks.  It always has, and it always will. Sure, streetwear brands are at the height of ‚Äòcool‚Äô right now, and Supreme is undoubtedly the cream of that crop, but I stand by my point. I live in London; a twenty-minute walk away from the Supreme store in Soho at that, and I‚Äôve seen my fair share of hardcore skaters, moneyed Chinese tourists, and drooling streetwear collectors lining up for miles round the corner to the Supreme store early on a Thursday morning as they gear up for the launch of a new collection. People actually used to sleep on the streets round Soho on Wednesday nights in anticipation of a launch, and the only reason why they aren‚Äôt doing it still now is because Westminster City Council got so annoyed they‚Äôre cracking down on anyone they see on the streets there, $500 Supreme box logo hoodie fanatic or not. But it doesn‚Äôt take much consideration to realize that you could be spending all your hard-earned cash on more fashionable and/or durable clothes, instead of that plain white t-shirt with only the inside tee tag being the one indication that it‚Äôs from Supreme. I know, I know. You‚Äôre hurt. You need time to process this. You‚Äôre probably questioning my credibility as a streetwear connoisseur this very minute ‚Äì in which case I will have you know I am sat here writing this post in a threadbare Thrasher shirt I‚Äôve had for years and some beat up Vans. Or, maybe you‚Äôre angry. You need me to explain myself. Well, I‚Äôll gladly do so. You need reasons why Supreme is overrated beyond belief? Here they are. You will never be able to afford Supreme clothing.  Unless, of course, you or your parents are absolutely loaded and/or have a machine stashed somewhere in your backrooms that is steadily printing money. If that‚Äôs the case, well, good for you ‚Äì though I do think there are much better things that you could be spending mummy and daddy‚Äôs hard-earned money on, like a life coach who will get your priorities straight for you. But if you‚Äôre an average kid like me who can only afford to eat sushi when it‚Äôs going for half-price before the store closes and who bought their Lord Nermal phone case from a dodgy old woman in Thailand, you know that anything Supreme is just leagues out of your price range. With a box logo crew neck jumper going for $600, a plain black beanie going at $75, and collaborations with brands like Nike SB going for the price of a plane ticket from Bangkok to London, you‚Äôre better off heading to Sports Direct for some equally plain and functional clothes that don‚Äôt cost an arm, a leg, and your mother‚Äôs soul. Even if you can afford Supreme, you will never be able to actually  buy  Supreme clothing.  If you live in a city with a Supreme store in it, you‚Äôll only ever be able to get that Morrissey t-shirt or that Comme des Gar√ßons collab piece if you wake up at 4AM on a Thursday morning and line up round the block along with all the other half-asleep teenage hypebeasts sporting empty carrier bags and $300 vintage sneakers. And even if you‚Äôre in the line, don‚Äôt kid yourself. The new-money Chinese tourist in front of you with the BAPE hoodie and the wallet full of freshly-changed currency will beat you to everything you wanted in the store, and will whip your sorry ass if you even dare lecture them about how bulk buying makes it unfair for the rest of the people in line. If you don‚Äôt live in a city with a Supreme store in it, I hate to break it to you, but you will probably never ever touch a piece of Supreme clothing in your lifetime unless you buy it off eBay at five times the already ridiculous original price. The Supreme online store sells out within milliseconds, and there are actually people out there who pay hundreds of dollars for tech wizards to program them a bot that will buy them their Supreme hoodie of choice the minute it appears online. Can you compete with all that? Yeah, I didn‚Äôt think so. Supreme clothing is just gimmicky.  Anyone who has ever used Photoshop in their lives will be able to tell you that the Supreme logo ‚Äì the brand‚Äôs very selling point ‚Äì can be put together in about ninety seconds, including the time taken out halfway through to sit there and sigh and wonder why people pay top dollar for this shit. I could take my best Gildan Heavy Cotton shirt and print off ‚ÄúSupreme‚Äù in Medium Italic Futura backed by a red rectangle and have my very own homemade Supreme togs. ‚ÄúBut what about Supreme‚Äôs collaborations with musicians and pop culture icons?‚Äù I hear you cry. ‚ÄúI want a shirt with Gucci Mane flashing his grills on it too!‚Äù Now stop and listen to yourself. At the end of the day, that‚Äôs what Supreme‚Äôs output mostly boils down to ‚Äì using celebrity culture against you, or using their own overly-hyped image to convince insecure wannabe Cool Guys and Girls that spending $200 on a shirt will tell everyone that you‚Äôre in with the kids. News flash: Money doesn‚Äôt buy you friends, and neither does Supreme clothing. Remember the Supreme brick?  If you‚Äôre one of those people who thinks Supreme is not actually a brand but a ‚Äúlong-term conceptual art project about consumerism,‚Äù give me a few minutes to stop laughing before I continue. Supreme founder James Jebbia and his crew are shitting money, and they know it. They also know that they can use high-brow opinions like that to ensure that Supreme-heads out there would climb over each other‚Äôs dead bodies to buy anything that the brand puts out, including (but not limited to) an actual brick. For those of you not in the know, I didn‚Äôt make a typo. Supreme have put out a literal brick with the brand logo on it, which is good for nothing apart from either sitting there, serving as one of many as part of a wall, or being thrown at the heads of the idiots who are dumb enough to pay $1,000 to buy it off eBay resellers. There are actual essays floating around out there speculating on why the Supreme brick has been made, but if you think that reason is anything other than ‚Äúbecause they can,‚Äù you need to wake up, sheeple. Altruism is dead, Theresa May is still Prime Minister, and the Supreme brick is the new height of fashion because this is what happens when people throw silly money at other people for no good reason. You either buy Supreme because you want to be a special snowflake‚Ä¶  Let‚Äôs face it, that‚Äôs what you hypebeasts really are at heart. Dimitrios Tsivrikos, a consumer psychologist at University College London, says, ‚ÄúWe collect articles or resources to survive, but survival doesn‚Äôt only rest upon what we need physically. We need, psychologically, to distinguish ourselves. In the past, tribes would decorate themselves with feathers or precious stones to set them apart from other tribe members and attract potential mates. In the same way, collecting Supreme really allows people to build their identities with rare objects.‚Äù And this is what your buzz-fuelled obsession with Supreme really is. Human nature is making a bigger fool out of you than most, because you think that being at the head of the table boils down to owning that Supreme x Playboy collab tee. Seriously, if you want to distinguish yourself, just get a tattoo instead. ‚Ä¶ or you‚Äôre a scalper, aka free market cancer‚Ä¶  Come on, man. If you‚Äôre actually going to buy Supreme, don‚Äôt bloody resell it at ten times the price. You hurt the brand, you hurt the honest folk who actually want to buy Supreme to keep it for themselves, and you hurt the free market. It‚Äôs also just an insult to the people who stand in line when you emerge triumphant from the Black Friday-esque mess that is a Supreme store on Thursdays and attempt to palm off your newly-gotten goods at ridiculous prices that not even people who buy retail-price Supreme could afford. You are of the same ilk who made last year‚Äôs Radiohead tickets sell out in two seconds only to reappear online at ¬£1,500, and I‚Äôm just going to let you know now that there‚Äôs a place in hell reserved especially for people like you. You‚Äôre also one of the reasons that Supreme keeps its place at the top of its game in spite of the brand having almost no redeeming features in its output whatsoever, because you just don‚Äôt know when to stop cranking up the prices and contributing to the hype. Good job, kid. I hope you cry yourself to sleep when you find out all those piles of money don‚Äôt make a very good bed to sleep on. ‚Ä¶ or you‚Äôre just a corny Internet fuckboy.  If you‚Äôre a scalper, you‚Äôre a different level of douchebag altogether, but this one is for all of you who are under the impression that girls will want to date you because you listen to Young Thug while sporting that Supreme washed twill camp cap. Fun fact (and this might come as a revelation for some of you): Girls don‚Äôt give a fuck if that plain white t-shirt you‚Äôre wearing is from Supreme, or from the night market down the road. Girls like people who respect them, tag them in good memes, and occasionally buy them pizza and/or hummus. We aren‚Äôt animals. We don‚Äôt need Supreme-branded plumage to attract mates. Maybe if you spent less time forking out money on overrated clothing and more time on honing your social skills, you‚Äôd understand. You can make your own Supreme stuff for a tenth of the price. My boy TabaskoSweet says it best in this video. But seriously, if my friends can swallow their pride and get their Anti Social Social Club gear for $5 off some dodgy TaoBao pirate gear retailer, so can you. Mind over matter, as they say. It‚Äôs all there is to it. Even after all this is said and done, dear reader, you and I both know that there‚Äôs one overarching reason why Supreme may not suck that much after all. I‚Äôm guilty of it every time I spend the pay I work my ass off for on one, flat-colour box-logo hoodie that I end up still seeing in my dreams weeks after paying an innocent visit to the Supreme store. You‚Äôre guilty of it too, if you were even remotely offended by the headline. So let‚Äôs admit it. You, and I, and everyone else who‚Äôs a fan of Supreme, will keep buying Supreme.  Supreme is a brand that was built on hype, and thrives off the buzz that still surrounds it today, more than twenty years after it was founded. For some, it‚Äôs a status symbol, like what designer handbags are to mums ‚Äì why they think that way is beyond me, but everything is subjective, and this mentality will remain prevalent in society so long as people like the Kardashians can continue to make money off doing nothing at all. For others, collecting buzz brands like Supreme is a hobby, the same way some older folks collect stamps or antique coins, and will fork out thousands of dollars for one piece of old currency. And for people like you and me, Supreme is one of those things we grew up hearing about and got into along the way, because if everyone‚Äôs talking about it, surely we need to as well. Supreme is one of those brands that is enjoying the success it currently has because it was founded by the right people (skaters) in the right part of New York (the very fashionable Lower Manhattan), and found the right fanbase (fashion idols like Drake, the Kardashians, and Kanye West). They‚Äôll continue riding this wave so long as we live in a capitalist society, where celebrities rule the world and you‚Äôre considered part of an ‚Äúin crowd‚Äù if you‚Äôre okay with throwing away $800 on a Supreme parka. You know it, I know it, and the people who design for Supreme have this fact burned into the backs of their brains. This is just the world we live in. Sad, I know. But since there‚Äôs nothing much we can do about it, I‚Äôm going back to the Supreme store and succumbing to my desire to get that ¬£65 box-logo hoodie. The conclusion? Supreme is overrated. Long live Supreme.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Supreme-so-overhyped-and-overpriced,,,,,

I guess I‚Äôll have to wait until 2021. Problem is, I‚Äôve been researching and pricing my build to replace my 12 year old computer (that can‚Äôt really be upgraded any more) for about 3 years now. I think I was originally considering the i7 7700k when I started and eventually settled on the Ryzen 3700k. I kept putting off the upgrade because my home computer got me by (for productivity work at least until I get around to actually doing mobile and web development), but when we went to work at home, decided I really need to take the plunge and finally upgrade. However, do to the supply chain shortages, I decided to wait a couple of months until supply caught up. Then there was word of a 4600G, which really would have fit my needs, so I delayed further, but AMD decided to only release a 4650G not for consumers. On their word that something was still coming, I waited for the October announcement only to be disappointed again, especially with no 5700X either, but the Zen 3 improvement is enough that I think even a 5600X world work for me so I waited until Nov. 5, but now I can‚Äôt get one. The GPU situation is terrible and I hoped to avoid it with either a decent integrated graphics solution from AMD or buying a low end GPU that can display 4k as I don‚Äôt game but need the real estate for coding and productivity so don‚Äôt care about fast frame rates. Decent integrated graphics on a mid to high end CPU would save me at least $100 plus mean a cooler system with at least 1 less fan for noise. Even though I don‚Äôt care about high end cards, even the 1050Ti, which would be the minimum to be at least as fast as what I currently have is not exactly cheap (not near $100), and even the recommended budget 1650 Super is closer to $200 and many out of stock now. Just last night I had a nightmare where I dreamed the 5000s came in stock and I snatched up both a 5600X and 5800X because I couldn‚Äôt decide between the 2, but on my way home from the store, discovered someone had swapped some other computer crap in my bag and stolen my CPUs, and then I woke up!

Tech Scalpers,Will the PS4 still have games released on it in 2022?,"Sure they will, but as the years progresses, it will become less and less. Normaly in all of my PlayStation years since the original vanilla PS1, Sony usually abandons last Gen systems almost immediately. They abandoned the PS1 immediately after the PS2‚Äôs launch, and with the PS3 is was immediate as well, this was mostly due to the fact that the original fat boy PS3 had full backwards compatibility with the PS2, and PS1 respectively. As for the PS4 things started to change due to the Playstation store becoming a thing and the surge in digital game sales. However, within a years time, Sony was no longer releasing games on the PS3 at all. With the PS5 Sony wants in no way to focus on the Ps4 anymore, even if they make money releasing PS4 games still, you‚Äôd have to have an IQ of a peanut to think that Sony still wants to support the PS4 console. Why? Because of the amount of money Sony is losing selling the PS5 console just to get it in your home. They‚Äôre easily losing $200 bucks on each console, as they underpriced it for consumers mainly due to the recession the global economy was in during the COVID 19 timeline. Believe me, if it wasn‚Äôt for COVID, we easily would have been looking at a $500 to $650 price tag for the system USD. So what‚Äôs my point? Well, my point is that Sony only makes that lost money back by selling PS5 accessories. This is how Sony manages to break past even when they sell PS5‚Äôs at a tremendous loss. PS5 Controllers Headsets Cameras Charging ports Movie remotes All of these things add up to put them above the red. They can‚Äôt make back that money buy supporting and promoting the PS4. You all had a good 8 years with that console and its time to let it go. I have two PS5‚Äôs and XBSX and I‚Äôve never touched my PS4 since, and it‚Äôs by far my most favourite PlayStation system of all time, for now.    It actually bothers me that people still want Sony to make games for a last Gen console. It would take far to long to explain, but you don‚Äôt see any other electronics company actively promoting last Gen tech. This would be considered bad for business. Apple doesn‚Äôt do it, he‚Äôll they are the absolute worst when it comes to this. Often times when a computer breaks down or your phone breaks down and you bring it to their shop, they often encourage you to buy a new model, as repair would cost more to fix the phone than a new phone. I also don‚Äôt see anyone complaining or question if Microsoft will still Suport the Xbox One, and the reason for that is because the Xbox one fucked up and nobody cares about the console anymore. So to answer your question directly, the only reason why the PS4 might still receive some other games for another year or so is because of the damage that COVID-19 did the gaming landscape, and how it‚Äôs affected production of the PS5 units. As far as what I‚Äôve read about overseas electronic chip shortages, apparently in 2022 to very early 2023 everything will come back to normal, hence, Sony will be back to giving no shits about the PS4 anymore. As a business owner myself, there is no future in the past, only in the future and present. Besides, if Sony does for the PS4 with what they did for the PS3, the system will continue online support for an additional 8 years until the introduction of the PS6. Another reason why I dislike the idea of Sony still supporting last Gen or dead consoles is because since I‚Äôve spent big money on current Gen tech, I want all of their attention to be on what I spent big money for. Personally I could care less about gamers and their attachments towards their favourite older systems, or because they can‚Äôt afford a PS5, or can‚Äôt find one. Remember what I said earlier dude, the PS4 was my favourite PlayStation of all time, but like all relationships, they come to an end. I actually now have two PS5‚Äôs, both are physical copies of the systems, not digital. I didn‚Äôt buy them from scalpers either , and bought them at retail stores. I got my first one in November, and my second one in May, guaranteed I will have my third console before Christmas, one system for each room in my home, and I live in Canada dude, it‚Äôs not like my country is the first priority to get these consoles either. The TLDR is, you have another year, year and half of PS4 games coming, if that, it‚Äôs time to move on dude.",https://www.quora.com/Will-the-PS4-still-have-games-released-on-it-in-2022,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,How can I get a hold of a PlayStation 5 when stock seems to get sold out in seconds?,"You‚Äôre unfortunately going to have a very hard time accomplishing this. Sony recently announced that they‚Äôre having a shortage in supplies ( PS5 restock update: Sony sounds off on shortage ), so between that, bots, and other people like you just trying to get their hands on a PS5, you may be better off waiting for a few months for things to cool down a bit. I know that‚Äôs not preferable, nobody likes having to wait to get their new toys, but it would save you a lot of time and frustration. Plus, it takes time for companies like Sony to iron out all the bugs with their new tech, so if you wait a while, there‚Äôs a good chance that your PS5 will last longer and be of higher quality. If you‚Äôre still hard pressed to get one despite this though, there‚Äôs a few resources out there for keeping up on stocks. Try following your local retailers on Twitter, as they usually announce when they‚Äôre going to be getting a restock in. There‚Äôs also websites like StockInformer and NowInStock that keep track of when stores have it in stock, and if you have a keen eye and fast internet, you may be able to snag one in time. It‚Äôs worth noting that there isn‚Äôt many PS5 exclusives on the market at the moment, so if you already have a PS4, all you‚Äôll really be getting is a performance and graphics upgrade. As nice as that is, it‚Äôs not at all something worth stressing yourself out over. Above all else though - and I cannot stress this enough - do  not  buy from the scalpers. All that does is support their cause and influence them to keep doing what they do. For you, me, and everyone else that would love to get a PS5, please do not buy from them.

Jeff Bezos,What are the businesses of Jeff Bezos?,"To my knowledge none. He is however, CEO and president of several dozen. Most people think of big companies as one massive corporation. Few actually function that way. Amazon is made up of dozens of companies, most individual corporate entities. Each of those has its own presidents and some have separate boards. Mt Bezos is not owner of any of them, he is CEO of Amazon and more than likely its biggest single shareholder (at 17%) however, I cannot confirm that. Many people assume founders are always the biggest shareholder but it not always the case either. Often CV investors, early benefactors, or investment bankers can control more shares than the founders. Again, I don‚Äôt know if this is the case for Bezos. He is CEO of Amazon of coarse, Washington Post, and A space company that hasn‚Äôt really done much so far. He has other minor companies, some that report up through various Amazon entities like  Diapers.com @ Amazon.com  while others like Zappos are wholly owned by Amazon and were once individually listed, yet have their own CEO (founder Tony Hsieh) and board members.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-businesses-of-Jeff-Bezos,"I‚Äôd add to this by saying he owns the Washington Post personally- paid $250M.

Jeff Bezos,Was Jeff Bezos born into a wealthy family?,"eff Bezos was born on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological dad, Ted Jorgensen, met and started dating his mother, Jacklyn Gise, when they were both in high school. Jorgensen was 18 and Gise was 16 when she became pregnant. They flew to Mexico with their parents‚Äô money to get married. Jorgensen belonged to a unicycle troupe and worked at a retail store making $1.25 an hour, so he didn‚Äôt have much money. When Jeff Bezos was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen. In 1968, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos, who arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba knowing only one word of English: ‚Äúhamburger.‚Äù Jorgensen agreed to let Bezos adopt his son and, at 4 years old,  Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen became Jeffrey Preston Bezos. ‚ÄúIt is of course unknowable whether the unusual circumstances of his birth helped to create that fecund entrepreneurial mix of intelligence, ambition, and a relentless need to prove himself. Two other technology icons, Steve Jobs and Larry Ellison, were adopted, and the experience is thought by some to have given each a powerful motivation to succeed,‚Äù Stone writes.  Growing up, Bezos spent summers with his grandparents on their Texas ranch,  he says in the commencement speech  he gave at Princeton in 2010. ‚ÄúI helped fix windmills, vaccinate cattle, and do other chores. We also watched soap operas every afternoon, especially ‚ÄòDays of our Lives,‚Äô‚Äù says Bezos. Bezos would also occasionally get to road trip with his grandparents. ‚ÄúMy grandparents belonged to a Caravan Club, a group of Airstream trailer owners who travel together around the U.S. and Canada. And every few summers, we‚Äôd join the caravan,‚Äù  Bezos says in graduation speech . ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd hitch up the Airstream trailer to my grandfather‚Äôs car, and off we‚Äôd go, in a line with 300 other Airstream adventurers. I loved and worshipped my grandparents and I really looked forward to these trips.‚Äù Launching Amazon: ‚ÄúI took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I‚Äôm proud of that choice‚Äù Bezos got straight As in high school, was the valedictorian of his class and was accepted early admission to Princeton, according to Stone‚Äôs biography. For a time in college,  he thought he would be a theoretical physicist . But it was years later, while working in finance in New York City that he had the idea to start Amazon. ‚ÄúI came across the fact that Web usage was growing at 2,300 percent per year. I‚Äôd never seen or heard of anything that grew that fast, and the idea of building an online bookstore with millions of titles ‚Äî something that simply couldn‚Äôt exist in the physical world ‚Äî was very exciting to me,‚Äù says Bezos, in his 2010 Princeton address. At the time, Bezos was just 30 and had been married for a year. ‚ÄúI told my wife MacKenzie that I wanted to quit my job and go do this crazy thing that probably wouldn‚Äôt work since most startups don‚Äôt, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what would happen after that,‚Äù he says. After much consideration, I took the less safe path to follow my passion, and I‚Äôm proud of that choice. Jeff Bezos FOUNDER OF AMAZON, BLUE ORIGIN His wife told him to go for it. ‚ÄúAs a young boy,  I‚Äôd been a garage inventor . I‚Äôd invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn‚Äôt work very well out of an umbrella and tinfoil, baking-pan alarms to entrap my siblings,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always wanted to be an inventor, and she wanted me to follow my passion.‚Äù But not everyone was on board. Bezos boss took a walk through Central Park and told Bezos that, while it sounded like a ‚Äúreally good idea,‚Äù it would be an even better idea for somebody who didn‚Äôt already have a good career. ‚ÄúThat logic made some sense to me, and he convinced me to think about it for 48 hours before making a final decision,‚Äù  says Bezos . ‚ÄúSeen in that light, it really was a difficult choice, but ultimately, I decided I had to give it a shot. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd regret trying and failing. And I suspected I would always be haunted by a decision to not try at all. ‚ÄúAfter much consideration,  I took the less safe path  to follow my passion, and I‚Äôm proud of that choice.‚Äù In short, He was born in a poor family but was raised in a family with fortune.

While technically not a failure, it's still something that he wanted to accomplish but couldn't. Also Amazon has started many projects and acquired many companies that didn't go anywhere but that's the culture of innovation and experimentation. Bezos says that experiments that do work out such as Amazon Kindle, Amazon Prime, AWS and others are so successful that they pay for failures such as Fire Phone, Amazon Local, Askville, etc. If you aren't failing and making mistakes, you aren't doing anything important.

Jeff Bezos,Will Jeff Bezos survive Donald Trump?,"Will Jeff Bezos survive Donald Trump? I hope so, because if he doesn‚Äôt, it signals yet another dark turn for our democracy. Mr. Trump is shamelessly using the office of the Presidency to carry out his personal vendetta against Jeff Bezos and the  Washington Post , and, as usual, lying his butt off about it. If there isn‚Äôt a law against this, there should be. Contrary to Mr. Trump‚Äôs numerous tweets, Amazon  does  collect sales tax in all of the 45 states that have such taxes‚Äîeven though the company is required under law to collect those taxes only in states where they have a physical presence. The company also collects local sales taxes in many states (like mine) and is working on technology to collect those in other states. Those many jurisdictions and convoluted laws are a challenge even to Amazon. Contrast that with Mr. Trump‚Äôs webstore which hawks his branded merch, like $100 polo shirts. It collects sales taxes in only two states‚Äîand those don‚Äôt include New York state where the company has a retail store in New York City, a pretty obvious ‚Äúphysical presence‚Äù which they brag about on their website. Just who is ripping off the states? It isn‚Äôt Amazon. Then there are Mr. Trump‚Äôs numerous lies about how Amazon is exploiting the Postal Service. To the contrary, Amazon‚Äôs package business is helping to keep the Post Office afloat as it loses money on first class mail. Package shipping accounts for substantial revenue increases for the service. Yes, Amazon drives a hard bargain, but so do other companies. In fact, under the law, while the Postal Service competes for business with other package carriers, it is forbidden to price these services at a loss. Mr. Trump is lying.

Jeff Bezos,How does Elon Musk compare with Jeff Bezos?,"Jeff is older, smarter and wiser. Jeff is a bigger visionary by far ( see my other answer which was down voted because some Quoraan doesn't get humor ) Super Serious answer: Jeff Bezos is the far bigger visionary.  Elon Musk does not come close. Every single one of us is a ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù to an extent - we all have ideas - from good to great, but we may not have the work ethic or influence, etc. to make our visions a reality. There is no doubt that Jeff and Elon are brilliant. However, Jeff‚Äôs EQ is undoubtedly higher than Elon‚Äôs which will inevitably result in quicker iterative leapfrogging results at AMZN while Elon struggles and plows his way through Tesla, SpaceX, Solar City etc. Bezos is a guy who had the vision to actively  cannibalize his PRIMARY books business  - by pioneering the revolutionary Kindle - a long-form e-reader way ahead of it‚Äôs time. And Jeff did this without selling everything he owned and  without sleeping on his friend‚Äôs couch. (This is a pretty dumb thing Elon did - reinvesting every single $ of his Paypal sale to crash on a friend‚Äôs couch cause he was homeless) Jeff bought  The Washington Post on his own dime. Jeff also bought through Amazon or as a personal investment several interesting businesses such as  IMDB, Zappos,  Diapers.com , Alexa,  Audible.com , Lovefilm, Shelfari, Goodreads,  etc. etc. which might not have made sense at the time of the acquisition - make total sense now. Elon has nothing comparable here. Jeff‚Äôs vision is several years into the future. Look how Jeff  leverages IMDB (acquired by Amazon in 1998) now ! Jeff married the right woman the first time around . Believe it - this one decision is the #1 difference in the accomplishment of your visions. MacKenzie Bezos‚Äô came to Jeff‚Äôs aid like a loyal wife should have - and although her scathing 1 Star review of Brad Stone‚Äôs book wasn‚Äôt well written, it showed her to be a loyal wife and definitely Jeff‚Äôs better half.  Elon‚Äôs married life is a mess. (the  only other senior-level  current Amazonian  to come to Jeff‚Äôs defense on Brad Stone‚Äôs book was Andy Jassy - which might partly explains Andy‚Äôs promotion to CEO of AWS. Jeff loves loyalty. Jeff is amazing at hiring and firing.  Many folks consider Shel Kaphan as a co-founder of Amazon, but in reality Shel was just Amazon‚Äôs first employee. Once Jeff realized that Shel was a hindrance in Jeff‚Äôs grand vision for Amazon - Shel had to go. Shelabration  - a no-expense spared party going against the Amazonian principle of ‚ÄúFrugality‚Äù in Hawaii was held for the senior Amazon execs including Shel and their wives/families. In Shel‚Äôs own words, the ‚ÄúShelebration‚Äù felt like getting a gold watch before he was ready to retire - essentially Jeff pushing out Shel from the company without a direct firing because of the respect Jeff had for Shel. Well played as always, Mr. Bezos! 5. Jeff also clearly understands who is indispensable and replaceable at Amazon.  If you have spent even a small amount of time either working or interfacing with folks at Amazon, you will realize something intriguing - many folks in the level 8 or 10 (Director or VP) positions seem to be sub-par, and many many folks slaving in levels 3, 5 and 6 are solid and have put in the years but don‚Äôt seem to get anywhere. In fact it is a running joke that Level 6 is a terminal level - i.e. whatever you do, you could end up at that Level even after z years. Several Kindle and AWS Directors and VPs joined those relevant Amazon orgs in a growth phase (in the mid-2000s) - they worked hard and rode the wave, so that when their coworkers left (yes, there is a ton of churn) they got promoted to levels beyond their capabilities. God bless them. Jeff doesn‚Äôt mind this. But when he needs to get rid of someone, or promote someone - he know who to promote. He know who and how to fire. Jeff also knows how to turn on a busy worker bee with a well-timed middle of the night smiley :-) which is like a mix of a da-ward and a her-oin shot to the brian. Example: See the latest big promotion at AWS: Andy Jassy was finally made CEO of AWS in April.  Why?  Because Mr, Jassy is fiercely loyal to Jeff (his scathing Amazon review of Brad Stone‚Äôs book was the ONLY one by a current Amazon exec; Rick Dalzell etc. don‚Äôt count cause they are no longer with the company). There are several other big guns, worker bees and BS artists at AWS. None of them will EVER get the top spot - not even the great grand father of cloud computing Werner Vogels. Because they are ALL REPLACEABLE. Andy Jassy is the only Amazonian at AWS who is not replaceable.  Let me rephrase that. Andy Jassy is the  least replaceable piece  at AWS. Andy is an excellent orator. Just watch his keynotes at AWS RE:Invent Las Vegas, and compare them to any other keynotes (Some like the EC2 one will put you to sleep in seconds) Andy might sometimes be the dumbest person in the room, but most everyone will believe that Andy is among the smartest in the room - because of his confidence and qualifications (Harvard undergrad + HBS MBA + 15+years at Amazon). Elon Musk has a long long way to go before he is mentioned in the same breath as Jeff Bezos. However,  the saddest thing  is that both Elon and Jeff are  wasting their intelligence  on things that don‚Äôt matter. The world does not need more crap delivered in 2 hours by a drone.

For example, if the chip shortage were influencing the availability of certain military equipment or perhaps medical resources, then they could take the chips away from auto producers and have them devoted to those security sectors. Of course, that would depend on whether the chips were compatible to be switched out. Otherwise, it would require that the US dictate to various manufacturers what chips they could make.

Jeff Bezos,What did Jeff Bezos do for a living before becoming the CEO for Amazon?," After Jeff graduated from Princeton University in 1986 with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science he was offered a number of jobs at Intel, Bell Labs and Andersen Consulting among others, but first decided to work at a fintech start-up Fitel. There, he was tasked with building a network for international trade. He was promoted to head of development and director of customer service thereafter. Undoubtedly these years would be pivotal to his future success working in a start-up with a role focused on international trade and customer service. However, the start-up, Fitel ultimately failed to take off so he transitioned into the banking industry. He worked at Bankers Trust from 1988 to 1990, and then moved to a newly founded hedge fund, D. E. Shaw & Co from 1990 to 1994. The fund specialised in the application of computer science to the stock market and Jeff was hired based on his overall talents. He became a vice-president at D. E. Shaw at the age of 30. At D. E. Shaw, he was tasked with researching new business opportunities on the rapidly growing Internet. While researching, he read that the internet had grown 2300% in one year, and that number captivated him. He immediately saw the prospects of selling products online, and sought to leave. Despite Shaw‚Äôs best efforts to convince him to stay, Bezos was fixed in his vision. He left midway through the year meaning he missed his annual bonus, and set out to build Amazon.",https://www.quora.com/What-did-Jeff-Bezos-do-for-a-living-before-becoming-the-CEO-for-Amazon,"You just obliterated the most common narratives about start-up guru Jeff Bezos. Some TV shows would casually mention he worked in finance. Another that I saw said of all the tech CEOs, he worked a regular job flipping burgers at McDonalds. You also have the common picture of Jeff in a modest house at the start of it all. The reality is Jeff, just like the other tech CEOs, were already well resourced, well connected, and no where near just a bunch of folks in a garage eating Ramen.

I don‚Äôt know how much he was paid early on, but it could not have been much. As the company got bigger, the stock was worth more and more. An ipo meant that stock could be traded on public markets and analyzed by professionals. Over time, as amazon grew, his stock became worth more and more until it reached its current value. Effectively, his stock went from being worth zero to being worth its current value. while some crazies want to claim that he stole the money from the workers, that is just not the case.

Perfectly good people fail at marriage, betray each other. And life goes on. We try to get through it with as little destruction in our wake as possible. Some are better than others at leaving no wake of hurt, betrayal, pain.

I can think of many alternative choices to staying married that might have been better. We do not know the details of his marital relationship but staying in a loveless, sexless or abusive relationship would certainly justify divorce in my opinion. The fact that he found another woman to satisfy his needs, knowing that he was risking a significant part of his finances and reputation indicates a large incentive to leave his wife for whatever reason.",,,
Jeff Bezos,"Who is the best programmer: Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison or Linus Torvalds? Why?","There is no answer. You need to put each of them in a different time context. You could argue -for example- that Facebook is more complex than BASIC. But programming in PHP is way easier than programming in Assembler. Believe me, I know! You could argue Linus Torvals built a whole OS Kernel for the X86 platform. But BASIC ran on 4K of RAM, in a computer that has less power than any modern toaster. Larry Ellison was described as an ""average programmer"". What's exactly an average programmer? I still don't know. I know coders that are amazing: Their code is clean, efficient, they know a lot of standards, etc. But they can't produce a single succesful product. Other coders are not as... sofisticated, but they produce amazing stuff. For example, programming in PHP is fairly simple. And PHP is not a language that demands a lot of ""clean programming"", to call it somehow. But Mark Zuckerberg grabbed the most hated programming language by professional developers, and built a badass product. And if you're a developer, you know there's nothing so special about Facebook programmingwise (at least, on the first versions). It's not the programming. It's the IDEA, the PRODUCT, the RESULT of programming what counts. I'd say, if an average programmer gave us the first functional (OK, semi-functional) version of a relational database (Oracle v.1 didn't really work, in fact, it was an awfully bad product until version 5), well, kudos for the average programmers! Having said that, it's true, Larry Ellison wasn't really the man who built the first version. The recognition goes to the late Bob Miner and his team. Read ""The difference between God and Larry Ellison"". It's great reading. The question again is, what makes a programmer a good programmer? If it's a matter of skills, Linus Torvalds is perhaps the biggest contender. If it's a matter of building something with almost nothing, Bill Gates beats everybody. If it's a matter of being a pioneer, without knowing much about anything, the prize goes to Larry Ellison. If it's a matter of seizing an opportunity from something simple, and making it big, then Mark Zuckerberg is the champ. Jeff Bezzos never wrote a single line of code, as far as I know. I might be mistaken. EDIT AFTER POST: If you really know about programming history, a lot of people BETTER than Torvals, Gates, Zuck, or Ellison should be mentioned.

Dennis Ritchie, Ken Thompson or Gary Kildall were by far more skilled than any of the mentioned. While Linus T. created the Linux kernel (and it's a huge achievement), let's remember Linux was a Unix ""clone"" (ok, not exactly a clone, but an OS built to be 100% compatible). Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson designed and built Unix from SCRATCH! Sure, the had corporate backing, but money doesn't build talent. They built the most solid OS for really underpowered machines (by today's standards) and their OS, and their derivatives still rule the biggest serves in the world. If that is not badass, I don't know what is. Gary Kildall built CP/M (among other amazing software). Remember DOS was a clone of CP/M. Microsoft bought it from another company. Gary Kildall developed one of the first optical storage (prior to CD-ROM) systems. He was one of the fist people to explote the multitasking levels of the 386 processor, allowing multiple DOS apps to run at the same time when Microsoft or IBM had noting of the sort, he built a better DOS than Microsoft (DR-DOS), and even Bill Gates recognized him as an influencer after his death. And there are more. So, the ranking of ""the best"" might not be for one of the known poster childs. A lot of people, behind the scenes, were way bigger, and without them, things wouldn't be the same. Let's remember: Technology is a matter of iterations. We developers today stand on giant's shoulders. We thrive because of the amazing work of previous generations. Whenever everybody calls us ""genius"", we need to remember we are not. We are nothing but the continuity of the great work of thousands of unknown programmers who gave us better tools to build better things. There's no best, there's no worse. There's just the tools and whatever we can do with them. We developers are not geniuses. We are artisans. We are closer to a carpenter than to an alchemist. We don't work with arcane powers unworthy of common mortals. We just grab some tools and try, every day, to master them to do great work. Could you say the work of a guy hitting stone against stone, 100,000 years ago, without any other sort of tool, is less than the work of a guy today, with electric or pneumatic power tools?

Jeff Bezos,What's it like to have a job interview with Jeff Bezos?,"Hi
Why, Jeff Bezos, in particular?
Anyway, generalizing this a bit... being interviewed by such a high ranking person will first imply that you are being considered for a post closer to his - as a very senior leader. He's obviously not going to interview a fresher or a PM. It will be all about
1. What you are as a person/professional, how will you transform the company
2. What sort of a leader you are (will people really accept you and follow you, do you have that charm in you).
3. What is your short/long term vision, and how will you make the customer, investors, employees believe in you & the company.
4. What is it that you have already proven - in terms of product innovation, beating the competition to market, or how you impacted the company's financial bottom line....

In fact, it will be more like a discussion of ideas rather than an interview. You will be expected to be on an even keel with him rather than be seen as answering his questions.",https://www.quora.com/Whats-it-like-to-have-a-job-interview-with-Jeff-Bezos,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,Who will be the next richest person on earth: Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk?,"Bezos started his small on-line bookstore,  Amazon , in 1994. He avoided huge venture capital investments, initially growing organically, and managed to go public riding the wave of  Dot-com bubble , but well before it burst. By the time of the crash, he was already selling music (Amazon acquired, among others, CDnow) and soon branched to other intangible goods (general merchandise and groceries came much later). But he was doing what other merchants (like Walton family) did: exploit cheap labor, collect tax incentives for distribution centers, force suppliers to play by your rules. Market loves that, so Amazon‚Äôs shares were rising before the company turned one penny of profit. (BTW, they turned a profit of more than $11bn last year, and still paid no federal taxes.   ) Don‚Äôt get me wrong: almost everything Bezos did he did right: from the gamble with Kindle and eBooks (where clash with Macmillan didn‚Äôt go so well, but all ended up in a compromise) to acquiring many smaller e-retailers to branching into customer-to-customer business to Prime program. The latest great stroke was opening us Amazon‚Äôs internal behemoth computing infrastructure as  Amazon Web Services . Bezos‚Äô focus was growth as a tool for eventual gargantuan profit. Full stop. That‚Äôs one of the reasons why his ‚Äúhobby‚Äù,  Blue Origin , started (and still moves) so slowly (but still attracts government contracts for non-existing engines and launchers). Musk‚Äôs temperament is completely different. After he recognized the potential of  Confinity‚Äôs  payment service  PayPal  and merged it with his online banking company  X.com , he was kicked out from the CEO position even before the IPO - so he failed to capitalize properly on his insight. Soon after that Musk rushed into participating in the first round of financing of a young electric vehicle startup  Tesla, Motors . This time he managed to get installed as CEO and President. But the growth of Tesla has not been slow and deliberate. Musk professed his vision to drag the world into 3rd millennium technology with electrified transportation and renewable energy, and this vision  was  the overriding driver of his leadership of Tesla. As you probably know, Tesla is one of the most  shorted  companies. The reason is simple: investors believed that legacy manufacturers and oil lobby, with the help of mercenary ‚Äúanalysts‚Äù, will have no difficulties crushing the newcomer who rushed ahead at breakneck pace. Well, they were wrong: with the recent offerings from many ‚Äúbig boys‚Äù, in particular VW concern and Ford, it is clear that the tide of electrification of transport is not turning back. Musk starter  SpaceX  almost at the same time he entered Tesla. In those days it was one of many of a new crop of space launch startups. Most of them are gone (only to be replaced very recently with the new generation); SpaceX survived, but just barely. The first three launch attempts of  Falcon 1  failed, and the fourth vehicle, the successful one, was built from spare parts and financed with Musk‚Äôs personal cheques. Had it failed, too, that would be end of SpaceX. So, you see the difference: Must rushes into implementing his ideas and realizing his vision, not always bothering how realistic they actually are (Hyperloop, Boring Company‚Ä¶). But he gave us not only marvelous Tesla cars but also, only slightly indirectly, ID.3, Taycan, Mustang Mach E‚Ä¶, not only reusable boosters that halved the cost of launch but, in a similar way, a pile of new designs to compete with it. Not to mention StarLink, one of many promised ‚ÄúInternet in the sky‚Äù constellations, but one that is actually being built. (BTW, Amazon also plans a similar constellation; it is not clear will there be a room for it on the market.)",https://www.quora.com/Who-will-be-the-next-richest-person-on-earth-Jeff-Bezos-or-Elon-Musk,"Double upvote here, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a Tesla investor.","Amazon actually did pay taxes, just not the form of taxes not everyone thinks of(forget the name‚Ä¶ great).

Jeff Bezos,What sets Jeff Bezos apart from other CEOs?,"Vision . Bezos knows exactly what he wants Amazon to be: the most efficient retailer on the planet. He's always thinking 3 moves ahead. Amazon began life as a bookstore, but Bezos's original business plan was for it to become a general retailer with selling books as a first step. Prime Air wasn't a great idea for delivering Amazon packages, but it's a great idea for delivering Whole Foods deli dinners. Amazon Go is a game changing technology that no competitor can match, because nobody has both machine learning and retail expertise. But he's also flexible when needed. AWS was not anticipated in his business plan, but he didn't squash it. Now AWS is responsible for all of Amazon's accounting profit (because all of retail's profit is reinvested).    This shows that Bezos has the humility to accept new ideas he didn't think of - a tough thing for a visionary leader. He similarly set out to craft a very specific corporate culture. Everyone claims they are data driven, but Amazon really is. Frugality is a company value, and everything and everyone has a cost. It's ruthless but efficient. Everyone else is thinking about the next quarter. Jeff Bezos is thinking about the next decade.",https://www.quora.com/What-sets-Jeff-Bezos-apart-from-other-CEOs,I love and hate Amazon culture.

Various sources say he was personally invested into making it huge, and that may have been to it's detriment. A lot of Amazon appears to me to be a twin strategy of creating / killing fast and releasing a large collection of products. As an example of the first, the storefront is in constant A/B testing, dropping and adding features every day. Anyone who's sold on Amazon knows how quickly things change. An example of the second is, of course, AWS. How many people know everything there is to know about AWS? The ecosystem is huge.","yeah, he‚Äôs a very scary individual",So who suggested the idea of AWS to Bezos? And how the person doing now?

(Its meaningless non information, the lanes available will be determined by PRICE, alone as it is the last hidden to most intel paywall) This info is held back until such time as the hesitant r9 buyer hears of the physical launch.

Tech Scalpers,Why is AMD‚Äôs answer to DLSS taking so long?,"Because AMD is not as big as NVidia, so they have to wait for NVidia to act first before they can make and release a final product. And Real Time Raytracing is not exactly a strong suit of AMD‚Äôs. They just barely added RTRT tech to their GPUs in the RX 6000 series. AMD waiting, though, is why the RX 6800 trades blows with the RTX 3090 and the RX 6900 XT beats it till ray tracing is turned on. Also why Intel thinks they are ahead, suddenly see their new CPUs suck, then get overtaken again by AMD in performance by a LANDSLIDE. AMD can‚Äôt just release their product first, because intel and NVidia are MUCH bigger companies and can afford to watch AMD make a fool of itself before acting, so AMD waits for its competitors to act, then makes final tweaks then releases its products. Radeon VII vs RTX 2080 Ti, Ryzen 3000 vs Intel corei 9000, ryzen 5000 vs corei 10000, RX 6000 vs RTX 3000 (scalpers and miners ruined the last two for us). These are AMD Victories. Also, AMD knew about Spectre and Meltdown before intel did, which is part of the reason intel surpassed AMD last decade or so, cause intel went berserk some cpu features that were suseptible to these vulnerabilities. Ryzen is also suseptible, but not as much as intel‚Äôs CPUs are, and the patch for intel seems to still hamper intel cpu performance by quite a bit, and only the newer chips are immune to it, but at a performance cost. Ryzen‚Äôs patch barely affected performance and newer chips (Ryzen 2nd gen and later) were not vulnerable at all and there was no performance loss.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-AMD-s-answer-to-DLSS-taking-so-long,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,Is there anything a console has that an actual PC does not?,"Simplicity is the biggest one. Even though the Xbox uses Windows it uses a slightly different Windows. It is more strict on Xbox then PC because on PC you have many different applications you can run which means if something goes wrong then you have to spends money on tech support or do it yourself. On Xbox fixing an issue is a lot easier which means getting accessories to run on Xbox is easier stuff like that. It is easier on game developers because they know what hardware limitations are and can work with that with PC it could be anything and that‚Äôs why they have minimum requirements. If you are slightly of with you‚Äôre minimum hardware requirements, you can risk it and try it but you also risk your entire rig, you have to upgrade which can be expensive. The Nvidia 3080 is 800 dollars right now, to give you an idea of what such things might cost, and scalpers bought most of them. Another thing is you get a controller with your console. With a PC you don‚Äôt always get a KB/M and if you do it is cheap. So you have to buy one yourself. So you can see where I am going with this it can be expensive to own a gaming PC but not a console.",https://www.quora.com/Is-there-anything-a-console-has-that-an-actual-PC-does-not,,,,,
Swiss Chocolate,American chocolate tastes very different from British or Swiss chocolate. How did this difference come about historically?,"The reason that American chocolate tastes so different (bad!) is said to derive from a time when the milk wasn‚Äôt refrigerated and it would therefore sour before being used. When the process was improved to include refrigeration the American consumer had become used to the sour taste so the manufacturer (Hershey in this case) started to add butyric acid (a component of vomit, hence the weird taste) to replicate the flavor. As well as the butyric acid, American chocolate uses GMO ingredients, adds more sugar, fewer cocoa solids, and uses vegetable oil instead of cocoa butter. No wonder it tastes different! Although not a direct taste factor, the process is different too: the US chocolate is not conched - a process that ensures smoothness instead of the grainy texture of the US product.",https://www.quora.com/American-chocolate-tastes-very-different-from-British-or-Swiss-chocolate-How-did-this-difference-come-about-historically,,,,,

They make chocolate for confectioners and many of the little chocolate shops selling hand made truffles buy their chocolate from a company owned by Nestl√©. And there are no secrets in chocolate making - the people in one country know as much as the people in another. It comes down to the beans you start with and then what you do with them and the Swiss have no monopoly today.

Look for craft chocolate makers in your area, many give tours of their facility so you can learn about where they source their beans, how they make their chocolate, how they try our different recipes or new batches of beans to fine tune the product, etc. Plus, you normally get a lot of great samples to enjoy along the way.",https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-learn-about-Swiss-chocolates,,,,,
Swiss Chocolate,What makes Swiss chocolate different from ordinary chocolate?,"Swiss ‚ÄòMilk‚Äô Chocolate All of the cocoa that‚Äôs used to make chocolate in Europe comes primarily from Africa and also other countries around the equator (it‚Äôs still not yet Swiss). It gets shipped to a port in Netherlands. This is where the beans are processed, in large factories and converted to cocoa liquor. The primary processing stage of roasting of beans has a lot of define the output flavor of chocolate. Which happens in Netherlands (So you see it‚Äôs still not Swiss). Now this cocoa liquor gets transported to Switzerland and get mixed into a recipe (recipe ratios for making a certain percentage of chocolate across the world is exactly the same) with milk solids as per recipe and further processed. Swiss without doubt have the best milk in the world. Now I would suggest, you do a blind test of multiple good chocolate brands and actually see if the Swiss one stands out. You‚Äôll be surprised how your judgment is based on the brand value Swiss have created and not the actual chocolate ‚Äòanymore‚Äô.

Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos really going to step down from running Amazon?,"The Amazon Man‚Äô Jeff Bezos Steps Down as the CEO  Jeff Bezos steps down as its CEO after 27 years. He made this announcement in an email to his employees on the 2nd of February. As per that email, he will transition to the role of the executive chairman of the Amazon board of directors. However, in recent years, Bezos had stepped back from much of Amazon‚Äôs day-to-day operational business and had delegated those responsibilities to two of his deputies, including Jassy. Andy Jassy, his long-time ally and the torchbearer of Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing services, will walk into his shoes and take the reins of ‚Äòthe everything store‚Äô. In the role of the executive chairman, he envisions focussing his time and energies on new products and early initiatives. However, this shift will only take place sometime in the third quarter of 2021 and he will continue to remain Amazon‚Äôs biggest shareholder.  To be honest, the richest man in the world (only to be surpassed last month!), needs no introduction. He is prolific and dons multiple hats. He is the founder of the ambitious Blue Origin, a privately funded aerospace company, and owns the Washington Post. Unstoppable that he is, he has a plethora of passions and has also founded the Day 1 Fund and the Bezos Earth Fund. There‚Äôs another reason why Jeff Bezos may have wanted to step back from the leadership role at Amazon. For a man as ambitious as him, things from here on could potentially become a lot less fun. Under his stewardship, Amazon reached $100 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Now, getting to $200 billion would not be as fulfilling an endeavor! Last summer, Bezos had to face his first congressional grueling as part of the House Democrats‚Äô investigation. The investigation had concluded that the tech giants Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Apple are all monopolies in themselves.  Further, the announcement of Jeff Bezos stepping down coincidently came on the same day as the news that Amazon would pay over $61.7 million worth of penalty. Amazon would pay this penalty to settle the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs charges that the company withheld some tips of its Flex delivery drivers over two and a half years.

Jeff Bezos,Would you rather be Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates?,"There's a few reasons why I'd rather be Bill Gates. The first one is related to wealth,  Mr. Bezos is what's called a middle class billionaire, while Mr. Gates is an upper-middle class billionaire.  That might sound weird considering that, on paper, Jeff Bezos is richer than Bill Gates. However, we rate billionaires on a scale from lower class to upper class billionaires. I'll only explain the categories that refer to Mr. Bezos and Mr. Gates. for the sake of simplicity. Jeff Bezos has almost the entirety of his fortune on Amazon Stock, that means that he was little liquidity, he can't sell more than a few hundred million worth of Amazon Stock without consequently lowering the valuation of his company. Gates however, has sold most shares of Microsoft throughout his life and has now most of his money is on a well-diversified, safe portfolio, owning stakes on companies like Catterpillar, Berkshire Hathaway, etc. and of course a little bit of Microsoft. If Gates wanted to get a large part of his fortune in bare cash, he could do so without hurting the companies he owns. If one of the companies in his portfolio went downhill, the losses wouldn't hit him so hard because he has a really well-diversified portfolio. Besides this, there's other reasons such as the fact that he's an absolute genius and is now focused on charity and giving back, which I think is ultimately what life is all about, and you don't need to take my word on this. Almost every self-made billionaire spends the end of their lives giving back. You can have some insights on Mr. Gates on the Netflix mini-series  Inside Bill's Brain: Decoding Bill Gates. For more info on the classes that billionaires find themselves on, you can watch this amazing video: ",https://www.quora.com/Would-you-rather-be-Jeff-Bezos-or-Bill-Gates,I've never heard of such a distinction such as middle class and upper middle class billionaire.

Jeff Bezos,Does Jeff Bezos have a glass eye?," Here's 2 possible scenarios: Nobody's face is fully symmetrical. Maybe his face is more asymmetrical compared to the faces of the majority of the people. You can see in the picture above how different Blake Lively looks if you build up her face completely symmetrical. You get 2 uglier (poor choice of a word when talking about Blake Lively) versions of a extraordinarily attractive woman. He might have bulging eyes. I honestly doubt that‚Äôs the case and I‚Äôm no medical doctor. I looked at few pictures and it seems the asymmetry is more pronounced when he‚Äôs smiling or posing. So it might just be the way he‚Äôs smiling or when he‚Äôs putting his games face on. Either way, I‚Äôll leave few pictures for you to draw your own conclusions. And rest assured that he is in perfect wealth/ health! :)))    Cheers!",https://www.quora.com/Does-Jeff-Bezos-have-a-glass-eye,Actually I believe he has what‚Äôs called Blehpharoptosis (p is silent). This is a medical condition of the eye that causes low laying upper lid. You can see here how one eye is always a little more closed than the other.  This is more pronounced when the person is smiling. other people such as Forrest Whitaker have this condition,"In my opinion, the fact that completely symmetric faces are ugly, is a common but wrong assumption. What doesn‚Äòt work is just mirroring the face, since you can easily create artifacts. For example, once the head is tilted slightly with respect to the mirroring line, you get weird effects. Also lighting effects should not be mirrored, as well as the direction of the eyes. Also expressions are usually not symmetric. Usually, beautiful people tend to have symmetric and that is often a selection criteria for models",,,
Jeff Bezos,Jeff Bezos is worth $150 billion. How did he get so rich?,"He has a degree in electrical engineering and computer science from Princeton University, which helped him to start his career. Before starting Amazon, he was already a young executive at a multi-billion dollar company, which he worked his way up through using his incredible skill and intelligence. He founded Amazon in a 1994 and became a billionaire when Amazon went public three years later. Most of his currently $200 billion fortune is in Amazon stock as well as Blue Origin private equity. The only way to achieve such a high net worth is to have an extremely concentrated investment portfolio that achieves extremely high growth rates. Bill Gates and Warren Buffett both have more money than him, but Jeff Bezos‚Äôs net worth is considered higher due to his illiquid Amazon stock value. Bill Gates sold the majority of his 40% Microsoft stake, and now has around 1.36%. He did this to both liquidate and diversify his investment portfolio. If Bill kept his 40% stake in Microsoft, he would currently have over $400 billion in Microsoft stock and that would be his net worth.

Hope those 10 minutes were worth all of that.","He wasn't going to hurt the mother of his children. Well this is simply untrue, as the act of infidelity is pretty much one of the worst things you can do in a marriage. I also don't agree with you claiming it's just a part of life. Yeah, for some people it is, but if you truly don't want to be with your partner, a divorce instead of an affair is the grown up thing to do.","This is a good answer, but I would like to offer you a slightly different perspective. Everything wasn‚Äôt just calm and happy in the divorce. The truth is that the bulk of things were just kept out of the media because MACKENZIE took the high road and didn‚Äôt lay things out in the public! She has children that she is thinking about! Now, let me add some dimension & perspective to this story for you. First, Mackenzie was  good friends  with Lauren Sanchez! In fact, THAT is how Lauren even came to know Jeff - through his wife! Lauren and Mackenzie had been good friends, had bonded over their kids AND Mackenzie and Jeff had even double dated with Lauren and her husband! Lauren had been hired to work on an Amazon marketing project on Mackenzie‚Äôs recommendation! Amazon was going to use her helicopter company to do some of the marketing work for a campaign. So, he wasn‚Äôt JUST having an affair; he was having an affair with his wife‚Äôs good friend! Not only was she Mackenzie‚Äôs good friend, BUT Lauren was also married at the time! So Jeff was smiling in her husband‚Äôs face just like Lauren was smiling in Mackenzie‚Äôs face! Second, Jeff didn‚Äôt just leave Mackenzie for some other woman of his own volition. He did the hiding and sneaking that most cheaters typically do beforehand, as did Lauren. They did that, of course, because they were BOTH married to other people! Again, this wasn‚Äôt benign behavior! Lauren has kids with her ex husband AND with that NFL guy, Tony Gonzalez & Jeff, of course, has 4 children with Mackenzie. I don‚Äôt know about you, but you can‚Äôt spend time chasing after your mistress and being emotionally present for your four kids at the same time! Again, there is nothing benign about that behavior. I‚Äôm not saying that people shouldn‚Äôt move on if they aren‚Äôt happy, but to classify that whole situation as some walk in the park because Mackenzie ended up wealthy after the fact, or because Mackenzie didn‚Äôt lay Jeff out in the media, is a real reach in my humble opinion. Mackenzie is a classy, down to earth woman who volunteers her time and talents and she didn‚Äôt deserve to have her life, or the lives of her 4 children, upended by two people she trusted! Neither did Lauren‚Äôs now ex-husband or all of her children. There was NOTHING OK about Jeff & Lauren‚Äôs behavior toward either of their families!","I‚Äôm richer than Bezos, despite having no personal income other than a small Social Security check‚Äîbecause my wife has put up with me for 39 years and counting. That‚Äôs worth more than Bezos‚Äô wealth. What good is all those bucks‚Äîvastly more than he can spend‚Äîif there‚Äôs a hole in the middle of your life?","Yes, it is extraordinary when you end something you vowed to maintain ‚Äúuntil death do you part‚Äù for such poor reasons."
Jeff Bezos,What is the biggest personality difference between Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk?,"Original Question: What is the biggest personality diferance between Elon Musk and Jeff Bexos? Ah yes. The battle of the Outer Space Sized Egos. First let‚Äôs note, I obviously do not know either of these men personally. I have one degree of separation between them only through friends that have worked for these men. From what has been shared, they are both pretty much as they seem. Very driven. Bright with, you guessed it ‚ÄîMASSIVE EGOS. Most people feel these egos might stem from childhood insecurities. I tend to agree but then again, I‚Äôm speculating based on what has been shared by them. And really, it doesn‚Äôt matter where these egos come from. Clearly these egos have brought them to where they are today. So we‚Äôll work from what we know and see  in the now. I can think of two personality differences that I‚Äôve noticed that I feel are worth mentioning. Elon Musk doesn‚Äôt care if you like him. He wants to be admired by those he admires and envied by the other 99% of the planet. He seems to make a point of telling people he really doesn‚Äôt have time for them. Jeff Bezos comes off as someone that still really, really wants people to like him‚Ä¶ or at least respect him. The other personality difference between them might come down to how they view success. I don‚Äôt know what Bezos would really do if he suddenly found himself outside of the top 10 wealthiest people on the Forbes list. He views MONEY as the end game. I think he would implode a little if he suddenly hit the ranking of 16 or something. While Musk doesn‚Äôt seem to flinch at the idea he could lose it all trying to do what he wants to do. He seems to believe no matter what, he‚Äôd be back and headed for the top the very next day. And while I would say Bezos ‚Äúbuilt something‚Äù with Amazon. It‚Äôs not exactly an invention in the traditional sense. It was a concept many others had, just not on such a massive scale. A lot of outside things had to go right for his ‚Äúidea‚Äù to even work. There was a lot of piggy-backing on other things for his vision to even be seen as viable. (Which I am giving him plenty of points for seeing that it could be done). But after the fact, there was/is a lot of heavy handedness for Amazon to be what it is today. In that way, he‚Äôs got a little bit of J.P. Morgan streak in him. He know when to uses his wealth to plow others out of his way. I‚Äôm not a fan of the monopoly mental. It‚Äôs hard for me to be impressed with him because of this trait. Elon Musk is an actual creator. He makes shit. Nothing I‚Äôll likely be able to afford or use of course.

Tech Scalpers,What is your opinion of seeing dead musicians on tour in a high tech hologram form?,"Thanks for A2A. What is your opinion of seeing dead musicians on tour in a high tech hologram form? You are talking about two different levels of music quality here. Without very clever sound arrangements, a live performance will never live up to the standard of the studio recording. The purpose of attending a concert, at least for me, is the entire experience. I like small venues of 2,500‚Äì3,000 capacity so that the band/audience interaction has a very high level of participation. I‚Äôm not going to a stadium with 40,000 people to get stuck behind a concrete pillar being unable to see anything without reach-around binoculars. I would rather watch that as recorded on TV. To get me to attend a holo-concert, the technology would have to be at least as good as the higher end holodecks from  Star Trek. Abba  is planning a pseudo-holographic tour in the next year or so. All four will perform in Sweden, probably transmitting to multiple venues simultaneously. At each venue, the original recordings will be played, backed by an orchestra, and the team will be singing over the top of everything. With 40,000 crazed fans screaming their heads off so that no one can actually hear the music (which is why the Beatles stopped touring), I would again rather watch the TV version. It‚Äôs very different when the crowd knows the songs and joins in, compared to just loud cheering and whistles. Hence my preference for smaller venues where people had to fight to get a ticket, and only dedicated hard core fans would pay the prices demanded by scalpers.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-of-seeing-dead-musicians-on-tour-in-a-high-tech-hologram-form,,,,,

Those wannabe part-time retailers who add nothing to the economy as far as jobs like real retailers are taking advantage if the situation.  When you see things like this on Ebay it gives you all the answers you need. No company can expect that a customer is going to buy 5-9 consoles at once and keep doing it. Supply chain or manufacturing capacity is not the culprit. You have even employees of GameStop buying up stock to sale at a profit for themselves. With more and more retailers using internet sale services you will only continue to see things like this in the future. Bots can buy an item much faster than most people can. They use DDoS style attacks to jump ahead of your purchase and they are buy more than the one you are trying to get. The consumer are also at fault as well. If there is no demand then there is no product to be scalped. You can fully expect that there will continue to be a shortage in both consoles for the rest of the year as the holiday season is fadr upon us and people try to these items as presents. Retailers need to put in place more effective measures to stop the bots.

Tech Scalpers,What are some ways to improve the hiring of tech talents in Vietnam as it's very hard to find good developers right now?,"Hiring technical talent in Vietnam is challenging, since most of the top technical talent who can get out of the country tend to do so. You can get a 33% raise ‚Äî easily ‚Äî by relocating to South Korea, and usually it‚Äôs closer to 100%. Vietnam has some rather strong immigration restrictions, including stronger language requirements than the U.S.. Planning to live there long term can be, shall we say, challenging. One of the big issues for many people is the requirement that one renounce citizenship in their country of origin. The U.S. does not require this for most countries for naturalization. This is mostly to control immigration from other Southeast Asian countries, but tends to act as a brake on attempts at citizenship by highly educated persons from other nations. Their residency requirements are about 25% of the requirements in the U.S., unless you are a person over 50 attempting to gain U.S. citizenship, at which point the language requirements and residency requirements are relaxed. Not so Vietnam. It also hurts them that they are one of four remaining Socialist Republics, meaning they actively espouse One-Party State Communism. You probably so not want to send your child to a public school in Vietnam; if you are wealthy, there are a large number of private schools which provide good education to both long term expatriate residents, and to wealthy vietnamese families. Likewise, public hospitals in Vietnam are generally underfunded and poorly equipped; this makes medical care an issue for many people, who are used to Western standards of medical care, particularly if you are coming from Europe or North America. Most expatriates do their banking in non-Vietnamese banks with a presence in Vietnam. Occasional bans on certain websites, and reduced Internet access are going to be a problem, if you intend to work in a technical or technology area. If you plan to travel by train, be aware that seating in the air conditioned train cars is generally sold out ‚Äî unless you find a ticket scalper, which is quite common for train tickets. One common scam is to sell you a ticket for a supposedly air conditioned car, and then you find out ‚Äî after it‚Äôs too late ‚Äî that you are not in an air conditioned car. To avoid agents and resellers (scalpers), the normal recommendation is purchase three days in advance. A lot of intracity travel happens by bicycle or motorcycle, and is not for the faint of heart. Crossing roads can be challenging, and making no sudden moves is recommended by my Vietnamese friends. Market prices tend to go up if you are a Westerner, since here is an assumption you are a wealthy tourist, even if you live there, and expect that if you frequent tourist areas, you may find yourself the target of pickpockets, on the order of Paris or Rome. Salaries are comparatively low; see also:  How much is a software engineer paid per month in Vietnam?

Generally those CPUs didn‚Äôt come down in price at all‚Ä¶ Tech can be weird like that, and it‚Äôs mostly because scalpers will see that stock is going down on a piece of hardware (never-mind because it‚Äôs obsolete and not in production anymore) and will consequently mark it up, hoping some sucker will buy it because it‚Äôs rare.

‚Äî 12:05 AM ET 05/21/2021 (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ( TSM ) said on Friday that it has increased its 2021 output for a key component for automotive semiconductors by 60% compared with last year, amid a global chip shortage. TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, said it had taken ""unprecedented actions"" to help automakers. That includes reallocating capacity to other industries that are also experiencing ""stressfully high demand due to the acceleration of digital transformation"". ""With a fixed short-term capacity, TSMC managed to increase 2021 output for MCUs (microcontrollers), one of the key components in automotive semiconductor products, by 60% over the 2020 level,"" it said. This represents a 30% increase over the 2019 pre-pandemic level, the company added. TSMC will continue to work with the automotive supply chain to deal with this current shortage, it said. Modernising the ""Just-in-Time"" supply chain management method and increasing demand visibility should be the path to avoid such shortage from happening in the future, TSMC added.

Chip Shortage,How is Apple dealing with chip shortage?,"How is Apple dealing with the chip shortage? Apple, unlike other companies, takes a different approach with their processors. Apple is on TSMC‚Äôs 5nm, while Qualcomm is currently right now on Samsung‚Äôs 5nm. Apple pays for TSMC‚Äôs first priority, or on their 5nm line, while AMD is currently on 7nm. Apple, compared to Samsung, releases fewer devices/phones compared to them yearly, and they use their Apple Silicon, instead of relying on Qualcomm all the time unlike other smartphone providers. Samsung utilizes both Qualcomm and their own Exynos for their processors. They use a mixture between Snapdragon 800 and 700 processors. Apple only makes flagship iPhones if you exclude the SE, which uses the  same  processor as the flagship iPhones. For example, the iPhone 12 Pro Max utilizes the A14, developed by Apple, while the S20 Ultra utilizes Snapdragon 865 or Exynos 2200. Samsung did use Exynos in the US for their S6, after the Snapdragon 810 (20nm TSMC) was inferior to the Exynos. I can tell you right now that the reason they put the M1 chip on the iPad Pro is because of money; if they put the M1 chip from the Mac, instead of just making an A14X for the iPad Pro, they can save a lot of research and cut corners during development. Don‚Äôt expect Apple to put the M1 chip on the iPhone though. There‚Äôs a reason why Apple Silicon wasn‚Äôt targeted of scalpers/miners, it is because their unlocked iPhones (some Apple devices can only be bought on their Apple Store and not on Amazon) can only be bought on their Apple Store at their website, and they have slower delivery times (2‚Äì3 weeks) as opposed to something like 5-day at average delivery on Amazon, and they aren‚Äôt as well-favored compared to PC gamers. Though, they did have to delay the iPad Pro shipping due to mini-LED shortages. I even would rather get a Apple Silicon Mac Pro and run Windows 11 via virtualization, because Apple is  not  a target, and they probably won‚Äôt. Though, Apple hasn‚Äôt been affected by the chip shortage very much, mostly because they develop their own processors and possibly being the 1st priority on TSMC‚Äôs 5nm, unlike other companies that mostly rely on Qualcomm.",https://www.quora.com/How-is-Apple-dealing-with-chip-shortage,,,,,
Chip Shortage,How did chip shortage cause an increase in used car demand?,"Used car prices are going up, aided in part by the Microchip (aka ‚Äúthe chip‚Äù) shortage. Higher average selling prices for new cars paired with increasingly low inventory means more people are turning to the used car market, which is causing more competition between buyers. The chip shortage is attributable to a complex set of factors, including how the pandemic disrupted the supply chain and how demand is surging due to the production of vehicles that are increasingly computerized. High demand, supply disruption. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, used-car prices have jumped 21% since April 2020. In that same time period, new car prices have risen by just 2%, according to the bureau. The increase in demand has surged even more for used trucks and SUV‚Äôs. At least for General Motors, they are building vehicles and simply waiting for the chips to be put in so they can get them to dealers. The chip shortage is attributable to a complex set of factors, including how the pandemic disrupted the supply chain and how demand is surging due to the production of vehicles that are increasingly computerized. High demand, supply disruption Lawmakers are also hoping to help with legislation that would invest billions in domestic microchip production to help make up for the lack of overseas shipments (which would then help the U.S. job market and the economy).",https://www.quora.com/How-did-chip-shortage-cause-an-increase-in-used-car-demand,,,,,
Chip Shortage,"How did the global computer chip shortage occur, and how is it affecting the world?","Automobiles have become increasingly dependent on chips - for everything from computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking. The world is in the grips of a global chip shortage because of demand for semiconductors surging far beyond capacity for supply. The shortage is crippling players in industries as diverse and far afield as automotives and smartphones‚Äîthough carmakers have it the worst. Apple, for example, has staggered the release of new iPhones to adjust for reduced supply. Ford, meanwhile, is predicting that the shortage of chips‚Äîused for onboard computers that control features like speedometers and antilock brake systems‚Äîwill result in a $2.5 billion reduction in operating profit as the automaker mothballs factories. It expects production to fall by half in the second quarter. The crisis has forced many to curtail the production of less profitable vehicles. General Motors Co <GM.N > and Ford Motor Co are among the big carmakers who said they would scale down production, joining other automakers including Volkswagen AG, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co. Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tighter inventory. They also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies. Sanctions against Chinese tech companies have further exacerbated the crisis. Originally concentrated in the auto industry, the shortage has now spread to a range of other consumer electronics, including smartphones, refrigerators and microwaves. With every company that uses chips in production panic buying to shore up stocks, the shortage has squeezed capacity and driven up costs of even the cheapest components of nearly all microchips, increasing prices of final products.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-global-computer-chip-shortage-occur-and-how-is-it-affecting-the-world,,,,,

Jeff Bezos,What could make Jeff Bezos go broke?," Do you know this man? Probably not. His name is Yoshiaki Tsutsumi. He ranked by Forbes as the richest man in the world over 30 years ago. Now he is worth $500m. Not broke, but a fraction of his past fortune, especially adjusted for inflation. This happened due to the bursting of the Japanese bubble economy and his Seibu Railway was delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 2004. As the Japanese commercial, and residential, market fell, a lot of his wealth fell hard. Here is the complete list of the top ten richest people (by wealth) in 1987 Yoshiaki Tsutsumi ‚Äî $20 billion Taikichiro Mori ‚Äî $15 billion Shigeru Kobayashi ‚Äî $7.5 billion Haruhiko Yoshimoto ‚Äî $7 billion Salim Ahmed bin Mahfouz ‚Äî $6.2 billion Hans and Gad Rausing ‚Äî $6 billion Paul Reichmann and Brothers ‚Äî $6 billion Yohachiro Iwaski ‚Äî $5.6 billion Kenneth Thomson ‚Äî $5.4 billion Keizo Saji ‚Äî $4 billion Many people haven‚Äôt heard of these people. Few of them are famous today, at least outside of Japan. So, Bezos is unlikely to go broke, nor are any of the other billionaires on the current list, unless they are taken to the cleaners by a corruption scandal, prison etc, which won‚Äôt affect most people. What is more likely is that fortunes rise, and fall, because most of today‚Äôs wealth is traded on stock markets. There will be some former billionaires just like Yoshiaki. It might not be Bezos, but it could be, or somebody else near the top of the current list. That is why rich lists are very misleading. They don‚Äôt focus on income, but wealth. Wealth can rise and fall in seconds. If Amazon falls by 10% today, or rises by the same figure, that won‚Äôt affect Bezos‚Äô income instantly, unless he sells the stock. So, I would take headlines like ‚ÄúBezos makes more in one hour than his whole workforce does in a month‚Äô, or ‚ÄúBezos loses $5billion in a day‚Äù, with a pinch of salt. ‚ÄúBezos‚Äô wealth fluctuated‚Äù is more accurate but also boring, so I wouldn‚Äôt expect the media to report it like that.

Jeff Bezos,"Who's the better visionary, Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos?","My answer might be a little bit different than most, here.  You see, Elon Musk was first. When  The Real Iron Man  got interviewed for the first time on his plans for SpaceX, it seemed very far-fetched. The guy wanted to use reusable rockets, visit Mars, and of course, get that money shot of green plants on a red background. Then, Jeff Bezos was second. He was interviewed. And because of his manipulative, always-trust-the-smart-guy-and-reuse-his-advice mindset, this is what happened:  He copied Musk. His plans were almost identical, although SpaceX had already accomplished a handful of things. Just googling  Elon musk hates Jeff Bezos , you see compilations of videos from the past where Elon wins. He‚Äôs always there first.  Here is an image from a couple of years back. This is Elon‚Äôs first futuristic vision coming to life.  Here is Blue Origin, Jeff‚Äôs brand, doing what Musk did a couple of years ago, but now. In fact, if you go on Google Images, it says that this is a new image from 8‚Äì9 days ago.  Jeff Bezos isn‚Äôt the richest man in the world. He‚Äôs also smart but in a different way. Although to prove this, you must look at how he holds onto his money. Bezos must acquire most of his capital and funds from investment accounts, his own brand‚Äôs stock, and several other locations. He‚Äôs looking to other very smart people for good ideas, and almost always, he uses their ideas to create a better investment portfolio. Elon is smarter, has better access to the smartest people in the world, and he‚Äôs  very  rich. Known by the media for his ultra-high IQ and his amazingly complicated brain, Musk chooses to surround himself with even  smarter  people. Some of his favorite knowledge and visionary sources are his senior engineers (who claim to be smarter than Musk on the development of rockets), other fellow entrepreneurs (not Jack Ma), and even Twitter (which he uses quite often). Growing up, he read all-day every-day to find evolutionary ideas for the good of humanity. He‚Äôs also hyper-rich. With the many deals that SpaceX signs, Elon is seeing a faster return and more success from his rocket company.  To wrap things up:  No, this isn‚Äôt biased.  I didn‚Äôt try to write it in a way where one entrepreneur looked stronger and smarter than the other. It just happened that way. Elon is so much smarter and has better ideas for the future. Jeff Bezos just knows how to find smart people and take good examples from them for his  own  projects.  In case you didn‚Äôt read, here are the top points that I have tried to prove: Jeff Bezos isn‚Äôt a visionary. He simply has smart people around him at all times (and certainly has the dough to find them). He likes to listen to smart people and use their ideas (Musk, for example). Elon Musk is certainly a visionary. Growing up, he read all the sci-fi books, watched the movies, and got bullied. The weak kids grow strong and powerful. He broadcasted his ideas first and got moving. People followed him. He continues to spue new, futuristic plans to change Planet Earth. Now, people copy him. You tell me.  Who‚Äôs the bigger visionary? ‚Äî Vlad  P.S.  Please don‚Äôt bully me in the comments. I might be wrong. We all are at one point.

While I agree with your view of Musk, Bezos doesn't publicize his vision the way Musk does. He just executes. I'll even agree with you that Bezos isn't a  creator  of visionary ideas like Musk is. But he has taken  one  visionary idea, the biggest in history , and made it his own. The original visionary isn't alive to comment, but having known him I can assure you that he'd be cheering Bezos on with every fiber of his being. Please see my answer to Will Elon Musk Surpass Jeff Bezos? ( Quora )","Blue Origin was created in 2000 whereas Spacex was created May 2002. Also, Blue Origin had the idea of reusable rockets from day one.

Jeff Bezos,Is Jeff Bezos becoming too powerful?,"Someone said that ‚ÄòInformation‚Äô is the new Electricity Imagine a world where someone actually owned the rights on electricity
The equipment to make it, the means to distribute it, the equipment to use it, the means to store it, etc. They would be the most powerful person in the world in just about every sense They might choose to allocate electricity to people on certain conditions, so that you could only use so much, and use it in a specific way
In this way, electricity would now be like money The owner of electricity would be both the richest and the most powerful person in the world At the moment, the Richest and most Powerful men in the world at not the same, and it is unlikely that they ever will be under current political systems But Information is close enough to electricity to indicate how it might be used in unintended ways, or have unintended consequences Now imagine Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft all setting up a political party with a few others of their kind
and let‚Äôs assume they divided their territories so they had no competition
and let‚Äôs say they set out solving the world‚Äôs problems from a technical standpoint rather than a political one Then the President would very likely be the riches and the most powerful person, and would have the support of the second, third, and forth richest and most powerful people, etc. In regard to the question, the issue is not whether Jeff Bezos is becoming too powerful, but whether he has set the ball rolling for a new political force to come into being that has not happened in previous history",https://www.quora.com/Is-Jeff-Bezos-becoming-too-powerful,,,,,
Chip Shortage,When will the chip shortage for new cars be resolved?,"I think one of the previous answers is correct; late 2022. Part of the problem is people put off buying new products in 2020 and now want to replace their cars, computers, etc. All of these require computer chips. When demand stabilizes chips will be more readily available and that may take a while. On a cynical note: Auto manufacturers don‚Äôt have an incentive to resolve the problem at this time. Cars are selling at or above MSRP and they don‚Äôt have to offer incentives. That means more money in their pockets.",https://www.quora.com/When-will-the-chip-shortage-for-new-cars-be-resolved,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,What are the best stories about Jeff Bezos?," Amazon's CEO has been the  WORLD‚ÄôS RICHEST PERSON  for  MORE THAN TWO YEARS , but he's much more than that. Here are  17 MIND-BLOWING FACTS  that show who he really is.  1.He makes $2,489 per second. That's  $149,353 per minute. That means that in just one minute, the Amazon chief makes more than three times what the median U.S. worker makes in a year: $45,552.  2. He's 1.2 Million times richer. Bezos is so rich that an average American spending $1 is similar to Bezos spending $1.2 million. The median net worth of an average U.S. household is $97,300. Dividing $121 billion by $97,300 comes to  about $1.2 million.  3. His first desk... a door.  Because he left his Wall Street job in the middle of the year, Bezos had no annual bonus benefit, so he had to be very frugal. In the initial years of Amazon, Bezos set up an office in his garage and  turned a timber door into a desk.  Till this day, the desks in Jeff's offices have a door-like design.  4. He's generous for a good cause. The man doesn't shy away from the charity if he believes in the cause. Once an employee requested Bezos to donate a $100,000 for same-gender marriage,  he gave about $2 million.  5. He's a Trekkie  Jeff Bezos claims to be a proud nerd and is a  diehard fan of  Star Trek . He confesses that he has been a Trekkie since his childhood days and loves the world of science fiction literature. He is such a big fan of Star Trek that his passion for the series  landed him a role in the movie version of the franchise.  6. He's bigger than a country‚Ä¶well, three. His net worth is greater than the GDP of Iceland, Afghanistan, and Costa Rica  combined. Iceland's GDP is about $31.6 billion, Afghanistan's is $22.9 billion, and Costa Rica's is $64.8 billion.  7. He had 70% chance of failing.  The richest man in the world told his first investors that  he had a 70% chance of failing. ‚ÄúI told our investors it was a risky proposition going in. At the time, I wasn't sure this honesty was the right thing to do. In hindsight, I know it definitely was for multiple reasons. Firstly, they  appreciated the honesty , and it built trust between ourselves. Secondly, if we do end up failing, I will know that I have done my part and I didn't intentionally mislead them.‚Äù  8. He built an electric alarm As a child, Jeff Bezos had a craze for science.  He set up a science laboratory  in his parent's garage, where he used to come up with new science projects. One of his early science inventions was an electric alarm. What did he need that for? Well apparently, he used it to keep Christina and Mark Bezos, his half-siblings, out of his room.  9. He has no memories of his father.  Bezos doesn't have any memories of his biological father at all. His parents were still in high school when Bezos was born, and the marriage lasted only 17 months. After three years, his mother married Miguel ""Mike"" Bezos, a Cuban who immigrated to the U.S. In a 1999 interview, Bezos said: ""The reality, as far as I'm concerned, is that my dad (Miguel) is my natural father. The only time I ever think about it, genuinely, is when a doctor asks me to fill out a form.""  10. He moonlights at the customer service desk. According to his company policy, each employee of Amazon has to spend  two days every two years , at the customer service desk. This also includes the CEO Jeff Bezos himself. So do not be surprised if you are an Amazon customer and one day you get to talk to Bezos.  11. Accidentally gave money away . In its initial days, Amazon had a programming glitch where if a customer ordered a negative amount of books, Amazon would  credit the money to their cards.  12. He worked at McDonald's... and automated it.  As a teen, he spent a summer as a fry cook at McDonald's in Miami, Florida. There, he set up a system that would sound the buzzer to let him know when to scramble the eggs, flip burgers or pull the fries out of the fryer.  13. He used to go on blind dates. He used to ask friends to set him up on blind dates, and his only ask would be: ""The number-one criterion was that I wanted a woman who could get me out of a Third World prison."" He meant that he wanted  a woman who would be resourceful . He started dating a member of his own staff, MacKenzie Tuttle, and the two married in 1993.  14. He's the greatest living CEO Jeff Bezos is the ""Greatest living CEO"" as declared by the  Harvard Business Review. The most distinctive feature of this list is that the CEOs have been rated keeping in mind their long term performance, rather than short term performance.  15. He lost more money in 2019 than any other billionaire.  He had to give up  25% of the Amazon stock  co-owned by the couple after divorcing MacKenzie. Still, he kept his ranking as the wealthiest person in the world. MacKenzie, now  worth an estimated $38.9 billion , is now the  third-richest woman  in the world after L'Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers and Walmart heiress Alice Walton.  16. The company was not always called ""Amazon"". Bezos named the company "" Cadabra "" in July 1994, but it was misheard as "" Cadaver "" during a telephone conversation with an attorney. Bezos knew right then that the name would not stick. In September, he even considered naming it "" Relentless. "" Still, his friends warned it sounded too sinister, so it went online as Amazon a year later  inspired by the river Amazon.  17. He's an angel.  Bezos also invests his money on a personal level. He was an angel investor in: Google  = $1 million in 1998. General Assembly  = $4.5 million in 2011 Uber  = $37 million in 2011 AirBnB  = $112 million in 2011 Domo  = $60 million in 2013 Business Insider  = $37 million between 2014-2015 Stack Overflow  = $40 million in 2015 Unity Biotech  = $116 million in 2016 Everfi  = $190 million in 2017",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-stories-about-Jeff-Bezos,"Just one thing I wanted to point out that I found humorous. Spending $1.2M is his equivalent of us spending a dollar. juxtapose that with the anecdote about his generosity when he spent $2M on supporting same sex marriage. Still a generous amount in absolute terms, but relatively his equivalent of spending $1.80?","You are an amazing writer sir, thank you for this!","Sorry for being an ass,the fact he cheated on and divorced his dignified wife for a gold digger ,is just disgusting but yes he is an outstanding ceo,wonder why his brain did not work in his personal life .",Excellent answer. Thank you!,very enlightening‚Ä¶ great write up.
Chip Shortage,Why is there a chip shortage for cars?,"You know how we use the term ‚Äúrocket science‚Äù to refer to something that is really, really hard to do. Pshhht. Integrated circuit (i.e. chip) manufacturing is immensely more difficult. First, it takes a facility that is 1000s of times cleaner than the cleanest surgical operating room, because otherwise, dust particles would ruin pretty much everything coming off of the line. Second, chip design requires hundreds of engineers to work over the period of a year or more to design today‚Äôs complicated chips. Third, once the design work is done, the process of manufacturing chips is months-long from start to finish, taking anywhere from 12‚Äì20 weeks. So, when COVID hit, automobile manufacturers made what they believed at the time was the right decision to halt sourcing of their chip supply. Stacking up inventory that wouldn‚Äôt get used when folks stopped buying cars because they were stuck at home was NOT a good idea, they rationed. So, rather than slowing down their procurement, they put up the biggest stop sign possible. This ground some manufacturing lines to a halt. Now that automobile manufacturers need chips, they can‚Äôt simply get them overnight, because those lines will take a long time to start back up and then there will be the 3‚Äì5 month lead time to actually manufacture the parts. Further, they may not hold the highest regard to semiconductor execs who felt like their customers simply abandoned them. More loyal customers may get the best response time. There‚Äôs one more very important thing to consider. As you can see in the following chart, there are four companies who manufacturer over half of the world‚Äôs chips. And,  every single one is in Asia . *gulp* TSMC: Taiwan UMC: Taiwan SMIC: China Samsung: Korea  It turns out that the US only manufactures about 12% of the world‚Äôs semiconductors, but it consumes nearly half of the supply:  Lack of manufacturing capacity puts the the US (and certainly US auto manufacturers) in a very fragile ecosystem in which China holds all of the good cards. This is one reason why Biden wants to allocate USD $35B into technology aspects of his USD $500B infrastructure plan. Now, $35B sounds like a lot of money, but building a foundry costs around $10B, so that won‚Äôt add very much capacity, and it will be many, many years before those foundries come on line. In the meantime, the US may be walking on egg shells with China for a looong time in order to continue receiving those precious chips.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-a-chip-shortage-for-cars,,,,,
Chip Shortage,How is the global chip shortage affecting Indian stocks?,"The long-term capital gain or loss amount is determined by the difference in value between the sale price and the purchase price. This figure is either the net profit or loss that the investor experienced when selling the asset. A taxpayer will need to report the total of their capital gains earned for the year when they file their annual tax returns because the IRS will treat these short-term capital gains earnings as taxable income. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate, which as of 2019 ranged from 0 to 20 percent, depending on the tax bracket that the taxpayer is in. For example, If you invest 1 lac rupees in any stock now in 2021 and in 2025 if you sell this investment for 2 lac rupees then it will be your long term capital gain.",https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-global-chip-shortage-affecting-Indian-stocks,,,,,
Chip Shortage,Why are we facing chip shortages?,"Well, demand is increasing and supply is not keeping up. Nothing today can be built without at least a nod to the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù realm of human existence. It is a one note Samba. If it doesn‚Äôt have a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù functionality, it is nothing. Cars, measuring tapes, food packaging ‚Ä¶all have increasing use of chips. Demand is going through the roof!   The demand for chips  exploded . Engineers in every field of product are compelled to incorporate some form of smart technology. Some will say that the pandemic caused the reduction in workforce and the shutdown of manufacturing. But that was brief. Factories are back. No, the chip shortage is due to the  small margin between demand and supply . A short break from production due to the pandemic revealed just how slim the manufacturing margin is. Meanwhile, designs keep coming along which incorporate more chips. More chips, more chips‚Ä¶ If a large electromagnetic pulse were to hit the globe, all hell would break out. An Earth directed coronal mass ejection from the Sun could cause large currents in the upper atmosphere. A nuclear detonation could do a similar thing. However, it might happen, this large EM pulse could damage chips. The chaos that would ensue would be of Biblical proportions. This chip shortage is a warning to all. We are becoming too dependent on our cell phones and chips in general. All the chips are in one basket. Spill the basket and everything comes to a halt. You think a viral pandemic is disruptive? Wait until you see how disruptive an EM pulse is. The design of an escalator is robust. If the power to it stops, it becomes stairs. Not as easy to use, but you still can get up a floor. Can you live without your phone? And are grocery stores and gas stations prepared to operate if their computer goes down? We have set up a world system of computer connections that are so interdependent and linked that a simple failure could cause the world to halt. It isn‚Äôt a matter of ‚Äúif‚Äù, it is a matter of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù. Will you starve when the computers go down? Chip shortage is a first world problem. We‚Äôll get over it. Until the whole system goes down. Broken chips and unusable communications channels will cause chaos. There are some people who cannot go through a day without their phone. Chip shortage‚Ä¶ Demand for chips is unbounded. Nobody limits their use. The mad rush to make everything smart will put us in a position of utter incapacity if the chips go down. It is out of control.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-facing-chip-shortages,,,,,
Chip Shortage,Is there a worldwide CPU shortage?,"Much of it‚Äôs been caused by the pandemic. Consumer buying increased, but it didn‚Äôt simply increase, it changed.  A big one was the whole working-from-home thing. When things started closing down in mid-March of 2020, I urged my wife to get herself a Chromebook, as her janky old hand-me-down PC was on its last legs. Sure enough, she started teaching classes virtually, and was pretty happy to have that $200 Chromebook (eventually joined by my laptop). A week or two after she bought it, you might have been able to find a $400 Chromebook, if you were lucky. In fact, in 2020, PC industry sales rose by better than 11% versus 2019, with a 14% boot in the USA. The top ten semiconductor manufacturers saw a 17% increase in sales in just the first half of 2020. And that was after a decade of slowing declining sales. So no one was prepared for this. In fact, many PC industry manufacturers had their projections based on the year-over-year shrink of the industry, so they were going the wrong direction on chip allocations. Companies like AMD and nVidia also had major new releases coming in the second half of the year, so they were shrinking stock on those older parts in anticipation.  It wasn‚Äôt just PCs, but gaming consoles that surged in 2020. Kids stuck at home, adults with unspent travel money burning holes in their pockets, sales of gaming consoles surged, despite the big three: the Sony Playstation, the Microsoft X-Box, and the Nintendo Switch being ready for replacement within the next year or two. Game sales, online gaming hours, etc. also surged. And today‚Äôs gaming consoles are competing for the same basic resources as PCs, mobile devices, and other things.  And then there‚Äôs cloud computing. ICs for data centers, including CPUs for web serving and GPUs for AI, have been rising steadily. But the pandemic moved vast parts of the world economy even more online in about a month. So the demand for increases to data centers grew well beyond predictions. And of course, data centers are all using CPUs and GPUs based on versions of the same technology used in home PCs. And even companies like Amazon and Google who make some of their own cloud-specific ICs, they‚Äôre vying for much the same production resources as everyone else.  Another factor is new markets for silicon, like cryptomining. At the moment, gamers and cryptominers have been duking it out over supplies of the GeForce 30 GPU series from nVidia, in fact to the extent that nVidia‚Äôs splitting cryptomining into another specialty part (like their ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù and ‚Äúcompute‚Äù GPUs) and lowering crypto performance on mainstream GPUs in order to preserve their gaming market. The bump in performance of a new GPU series can be money in the bank for cryptominers. That‚Äôs the obvious reason for the GPU storage specifically, but of course, if nVidia could get more production with TSMC, they‚Äôd be more than happy to make enough GPUs for everyone. While some cryptomining takes place on dedicated cryptomining processors, those are made in the same fabs as everything else.  Early on, car sales plummeted, and suppliers of automotive semiconductors switched over to consumer and computer electronics parts where possible. Car manufacturers cut their orders. But then ‚Äî whoops ‚Äî the automotive industry bounced back faster then expected, only with a major shortage of many needed chips.  Part of it was the rise of the fabless semiconductor manufacturer. Traditional IC companies like Intel and Samsung have their own IC fabrication lines, and can decide internally which parts make more sense for their market. But a huge sector of the industry, including AMD, Apple, nVidia, Qualcomm, Broadcom, and others depend on contract IC fab companies like TSMC and Global Semiconductor. In 2020, 32.9% of all ICs were manufactured by a contract fab. And an even larger percentage of the leading-edge parts. When a semiconductor company contracts with a fab for IC production, they generally have to make their requests known well in advance. As IC fabs have become more expensive, their owners need to keep them as fully active as possible to maximize profit and ensure they‚Äôre able to pay for the next set of process advances. In fact, this need to keep IC fabs full is what initially lead to contract manufacturing and fabless semiconductor companies. Samsung, for example, has their own production lines, but fills in their own work with outside contracts to keep the lines going. Even Intel contracts out some chip fab capacity. So while a fabless company might be able to shift exactly what they‚Äôre making on the same processes, they can‚Äôt necessarily do anything short-term about their total capacity, since the contractor is fully booked. TSMC, the largest of the contract manufacturers, is fully booked through 3Q2021 right now. And the more aggressive process lines, like 7nm and 5nm, were probably booked to capacity a few years back. TSMC‚Äôs 3nm process isn‚Äôt even on-line yet and it‚Äôs fully booked through 2024! In short, the tight market for state-of-the-art chip technology, forced both by the cost of new fabs and the use of contract fabs, has made the industry very inelastic when it comes to unplanned demand.

With the latest GPU, you essentially get a mini-supercomputer for application like CFD,  Molecular dynamics ,  Seismic, weather, Climate modeling. Numerous Engineer have NVIDIA card in their desktop now. Also, several of the TOP500 supercomputer do to (and not just one card). You already mention AI. However, in 3D and Photorealistic, the demand is much higher than a few years ago. Now, many artists that sometime were working with an Integrated Intel graphic capacity have added 2 X RTX 3080 or 3090 to their desktop. Of course, the 3D render farm have a lot of them too.","The company I work for builds a wifi module, and the shortage is really killing us. Lead times for IC‚Äôs that we use went from long to very long and now to insanely long, like 70 weeks. The manufacturer can‚Äôt produce the chips that we need, so we cannot make delivery commitments to our customer‚Ä¶..several companies are in the same boat, and it is becoming a very big issue.","The shortage seems to have dominoed down to simple specialized applications. Top level curling competitions have for several years used electronics imbedded in the curling stone handles to determine whether the stone was released before crossing the hogline as the rules require. The output was restricted to red or green LEDs in the handle, and resetting was done by turning the stone over, which is always done by the curler prior to throwing the rock (to brush off the bottom of the stone). This year at the various Canadian curling championship events (held in a ‚Äúbubble‚Äù in Calgary) the electronics for these handles were unavailable. The curlers were required to police themselves, as they have always done for club-level games.",So demand went up for everything?,There‚Äôs a chip shortage because Bill Gates used those in the millions of COVID-19 vaccines.
Chip Shortage,What are the reasons for the current global chip shortage?,"There was a long queue of semiconductor manufacturers developing anyway. Supply has been outstripping demand for several years and whilst there are small boom/bust cycles in there, industry has never really caught up with demand Carmakers predicted a drop-off in sales and cancelled orders (except Toyota(*)). In the meantime the pandemic drove consumer electronics demand up (causing shortfalls on just about everything as manufacturers scrambled to keep up) and car sales climbed earlier than expected. When carmakers started putting in orders they found themselves at the back of already longer queues (except Toyota(*)) Covid didn't cause the shortage. It just pushed the buttons to make it (and other supply chain weaknesses) happen. The storm wasn't the cause of the underlying structure being so weak that it would fall over with the first big wave that came along, merely the provider of the wave (*) Toyota identified semiconductors as a critical disruption-vulnerable component after the 2011 earthquake and ensured that it had SUFFICIENT stock of devices on hand to cover order delays at all times. The ‚ÄòToyota Way‚Äô (just in time manufacturing system) is about eliminating EXCESS inventory from stock, not ALL inventory from stock. One must maintain sufficient reserves to keep the factory running - this is something that organisations aping Toyota's highly successful management system have utterly ignored after only reading the first page or so of the Toyota system and ignoring the other 100 or so books on the topic (the other part of the Toyota Way is to always solve problems when they happen, allow workers at any level to come up with those solutions and reward them for doing so. Most narcissistic western management utterly ignore this part and remain utterly class-bound in their approach to company operations.

Both American and UK chocolate makers are now prohibited from calling their products chocolate if they contain any vegetable oil other than cacao butter. However, whereas the minimum cacao content in the US is 10%, the European minimum is 20%. That means many of the mass-market US chocolates will tend to have a less intense flavor than their European counterparts. Likewise, higher-end producers on both sides of the Atlantic will use more cacao butter, along with top-quality butter and high-fat cream. Additionally, as with wine or coffee, the source of the ingredients is very significant.

Tech Scalpers,What's a GPU scalper?,"In short: an asshole with a questionable sense of morality in long: a person that typically uses bots on popular tech sites to buy up a GPU/GPUs in bulk as soon as it launches, so that when it goes out of stock they can sell it at a significantly inflated price on ebay for a profit, typically they don't earn all that much considering how much they buy, but with the stock shortages now, a lot of them have managed to scalp (no pun intended) a big bit of profit",https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-GPU-scalper,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,How much should Nvidia be blamed for the supply shortages of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090?,"How much should Nvidia be blamed for the supply shortages of the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090? I will preface this with the fact that RTX 3090s are not in short supply (at least here in Australia). If I had the money to buy them, I could go out and buy dozens of them today. It is mainly the RTX 3080 (and the 6800, 6800xt and 6900 xt) that are in short supply. TL;DR: The supply of 30 series GPUs was higher than the supply of 20 series GPUs around launch. The scarcity is down to record breaking demand (and a few other factors). Is the short supply of RTX 3080s Nvidia‚Äôs fault? Not really. It has been the perfect storm of the pandemic, related component shortages and high demand. So, let‚Äôs go down the list and look at the various issues: Nvidia. The RTX 3080 die is huge, it is about 20% bigger than the RTX 2080 die but still around 100mm^2 smaller than the 2080 ti die despite being manufactured on a smaller lithography process. This large die size limits the amount of dies that can be manufactured per 300mm silicon wafer and increases the failure rate due to defects. The pandemic. This has multiple points which helped bring about the shortage. For starters, factories in China shutdown for a long while which severely disrupted the supply chain for most manufacturing. Factories in China have pretty much recovered but the knock on effects from the shutdowns will be felt for a while yet. A lot of goods being shipped out of China used to go in the bellies of passenger airline flights. The lack of air flights from China meant that the only viable way to mass ship anything was via sea freight. Extra capacity in sea freight is extremely limited and sea freight is really slow so despite the slow shipping, freight costs skyrocketed. Shipping from China still hasn‚Äôt recovered yet. Component shortages are a direct result of the factory shutdowns in China. China manufactures a vast majority of the non-IC components used in electronics today so a disruption in China disrupts everyone manufacturing anything once their inventory gets low - this happened pretty quickly because most manufacturers order things to arrive as they are needed instead of keep warehouses full of inventory. Currently there is a shortage on the substrates used in the manufacturing of integrated circuits. These substrates are essential for the process so this shortage will cause a disruption in the production of GPU dies along with CPU dies and any other integrated circuit. Finally we have the extremely high demand. COVID lockdowns meant that a heck of a lot of people are stuck at home without much to occupy their time. Steam, one of many game platforms, hit record highs number of concurrent users online quite a few times over the past year. This demand for entertainment meant that a lot of people have been wanting to upgrade their old computers or even buy their first gaming computer. Add to this the enormous number of people who could, for the first time ever, work from home who didn‚Äôt think twice about getting their work to pay for a epic gaming build. Even gaming/ergonomic chairs didn‚Äôt escape this buying frenzy, decent gaming chairs for under $1000 were pretty much totally sold out and preorders were sold out in minutes of coming online - I had the misfortune of having my computer chair break in March and it took me until June to get a chair that I ended up paying $900 for (it was worth the cost but I was hoping to pay a lot less for a chair). Adding to this extremely high demand is scalpers who use bots to buy up high demand items as quickly as they can so they can be resold for a profit. I wouldn‚Äôt have such a problem with these guys if they didn‚Äôt use the bots to gain a unfair advantage over the regular Joe. There is a pretty large amount of GPUs, CPUs, game consoles and what not being held by scalpers who are trying to sell them at highly inflated costs. However, without the scalpers there would still be a scarcity of products available due to the high demand and the supply chain issues. From sources within the industry (as reported by tech YouTubers like Jayztwocents and Gamers Nexus), the supply of 30 series was much higher than the supply of the 20 series, it was just that demand was so much higher for this launch which is why shortages have occurred. Supply is expected to start meeting demand (i.e. stock should start hanging around on shelves instead of instantly being sold) around April to June this year. If you have a working computer at the moment, you really should wait for a while before upgrading. Before buying anything, google the MSRP of the product to see how much more you are paying. The USA currently has tariffs in place which is increasing the cost of goods from China by a fair bit but as the Biden administration gets settled in these tariffs may disappear.",https://www.quora.com/How-much-should-Nvidia-be-blamed-for-the-supply-shortages-of-the-RTX-3080-and-RTX-3090,,,,,
Tech Scalpers,Should I invest in Bitcoin right now (2018)?,"In Short. Yes. But stay diversified and keep an eye on up and coming tech. related coins. Be aware 99% are shitcoins.

Never follow the fear crowd. Buy the fear. Whats really happened, people cashing out, moving as much money around before the new year, dump it all and buy it back cheaper, why not. I do believe it is going to be a slower steady climb than before, but still long term hold game. Have a sensible split 40% BTC, say 20‚Äì30% ETH, some others you like.

Tech Scalpers,"How can you fix the ticket scalper issue on sites like Ticketmaster, LiveNation, and AXS?","Two different questions - to remove scalping for a particular provider requires changes to their ticket tracking technology and orginizer's ability to enforce it.

Tech Scalpers,Why don't retailers allow backorders for popular items like PlayStation 5? Why can't they just put everyone on a waiting list instead of forcing everyone to compete over small batches of product?,"Right now, scalping is a huge problem for these big ticket items. Scalpers are making millions buying these big ticket tech items and reselling them at double (or more) the cost. Many scalpers are accomplishing this by having bots running that bombard the server with purchase requests once stock is available, securing as many of the item in question as possible. Purchasing limitations are easily bypassed by adding a change of IP address via VPN and/or varied customer details as part of the program. This puts the average consumer at a disadvantage to purchasing the item. A wait list will not resolve, but compound, the problem. Wait lists will not increase the supply to levels that negate scalping, and there likely will not be such an excess of a given item (like the ps5) for quite some time after launch (likely after several release cycles.) What the wait list will do is allow these bots to issue significantly more orders than they are currently capable of issuing. Instead of a scalper's bot securing (hypothetical and arbitrary numbers for demonstrative purposes) maybe 70 out of a retailer's 500 available consoles, with three other scalpers also getting 70, leaving 220 consumers with the others, instead a wait may be almost 20,000 entries (or more) long, and the bots will still have attacked the list immediately. The wait list will be absolutely filled with bot entries, speckled only occasionally with actual consumers. In the absolute best case, the ratio of scalper-to-consumer purchase would remain constant. However, with a larger window for purchase and likely no (significant) monetary commitment until the product is available, there are even fewer restrictions on scalpers just letting their bots run wild. I understand the frustration. There are a lot of cool toys on the market right now that are being scalped to holy hell because of their limited availability, and it sucks. Something significant needs to be done to address the problem. But unfortunately, wait lists simply don't address the root cause of the problem, and subsequently are much more likely to instead help grow the problem.",https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-retailers-allow-backorders-for-popular-items-like-PlayStation-5-Why-cant-they-just-put-everyone-on-a-waiting-list-instead-of-forcing-everyone-to-compete-over-small-batches-of-product,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,How do I get a hold of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos?,"You can email  jeff@amazon.com  and state your case. One of his email minders will alert him if it‚Äôs anything that needs his attention.

Okay, now to waste yall‚Äôz time with humorous response, having already answered  How can I get in touch with Mark Zuckerberg? Jeff‚Äôs a tougher cat to corner than the Zuck, so it‚Äôs a challenge. Mark is a fairly normal guy who you sometimes see around down, playing ping pong or at a fast food takeout counter, so there‚Äôs that. But Jeffy B doesn‚Äôt to mingle with us common people. So it won‚Äôt work just to get super rich and then join his country club or buy the house next door. I think he‚Äôs a bit of a hermit. So what will work? As with Facebook, you can invent a super important technology or start a company that is a competitive threat or opportunity. Have your people contact his people, and soon enough you will meet him. Find something he cares a lot about, like space exploration, preserving endangered species, or the meaning of time, history, and existence. If you can bring back the saber toothed cat or the moa bird, he wants to talk to you. More practically, you can work with the  Long Now Foundation , which he supports. Even if you never meet him, that‚Äôs a very interesting organization. As for hobbies, Jeff loves cooking and is a big fan of Lizzo. So start a cooking contest, bring in Lizzo to judge, and ask her to personally invite Jeff. He‚Äôll be starstruck. That‚Äôs the surest way, almost 100% likely to work. As with Facebook, Amazon probably gets dozens of legal threats and a few lawsuits every day of the week, mostly from crackpots, so if the only thing you want to tell him is that Amazon has done something horribly wrong and you‚Äôre going to put them in their place, forget about it. Most of those lawsuits won‚Äôt even get his attention, that‚Äôs for the company‚Äôs law firms and in house lawyers.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-a-hold-of-Amazon-CEO-Jeff-Bezos,,,,,
Jeff Bezos,"Who is smarter, Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos?","Hands down, Elon is. No knock on Bezos, but Elon can go deeper and broader. As a teen he taught himself how to code and today is considered a versitile software engineer. He earned a BS in Physics from Penn and BS in Econ from Wharton on a scholarship while going to the least number of classes possible. To make extra cash in school he custom built computers for less money than anything commercially available. He also repaired and debugged others. Among the high achievers in his Econ classes Musk was obviously way outside the Bell Curve according to Navaid Farook, who lived with him in the dorm. The same was true for Physics where he never scored less than 97% on his papers and where he developed an interest in supercapacitors which in turn took him to Stanford. Elon applied for and was accepted into the Stanford Physics PhD program. Every year 600+ apply and 60 get accepted. Stanford consistently rates in the top 5 for physics in the USA and also the entire world. Consequently, that is some very rare air to be breathing if you happen to get accepted. Despite the fact that he left after only 2 days in the program, to start a company with his brother Kimble. It was successful and set the ball rolling for PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, Boring Company and others. That alone is an accomplishment and testimony to his intellect. Then there is the fact that he taught himself rocket science over a period of two years and in three he was up to speed with the best. Additionally, he has received a majority of the most prestigious aerospace society awards for his relentless contribution to the advancement of rocket science and is thus recognized by the smartest people in academia and aerospace industry as an expert in the field. Furthermore, in the space launch business he has built a very disruptive company that provides a route to geosynchronous orbit that is by far the least expensive. He did this while simultaneously designing, building and running Tesla Motors which is disrupting the automobile business. The same goes for the battery business, the solar business and AI. Now Jeff is a very smart fellow too. But he is more of a brilliant business leader as evidenced by his wealth, whereas Elon is more of a scientist plus business leader as evidenced by his first to market innovations that disrupt their industries. Then there is this:  Elon Musk | Royal Society Elon is like Howard Hughes without the crazy part.",https://www.quora.com/Who-is-smarter-Elon-Musk-or-Jeff-Bezos,"100 percent. Elon, from a very young age, was immersed in learning. He would spend all day reading as a child. I believe he even read up to two books within a single day. He was subjected to a lot of bullying in South Africa at the elementary and high schools he attended. His father was also abusive. This resulted in him being very socially withdrawn and spending most of his time learning. Years of this continual learning has resulted in an extraordinarily brilliant self-made man who is relatively speaking very young.","I would say the answer this question really depends on what type of intelligence we‚Äôre talking about. Like you said, Musk is a lot smarter in the technical and scientific stuff while Bezos is great because of his leadership. That‚Äôs my opinion at least",Jeff has a computer science and EE degree from princeton? I‚Äôd say him and Elon are on par considering Jeff owns Blue Origin and Amazon is advancing AI also. Jeff is out of the public eye while Elon feeds off publicity. Jeff has 1M followers on Twitter vs Elon‚Äôs 20M. Jeff is also richer which means he has had a bigger impact on more people. They are both very bright and have been for a ling time.,"At this point, I am wondering if he IS working on the crazy part. I am sure a lot of it is due to the long work hours and scads of detractors hamming him and his babies (companies) from all sides. That could start to get to a person after several years.","Except how to make a profit, and of course, tell the truth."
Jeff Bezos,What is it like to work for Jeff Bezos?,"‚ÄúPeople like Jeff are better regarded as hyper-intelligent aliens with a tangential interest in human affairs.‚Äù Steve Yegge inadvertently made a public post of an internal message comparing styles at Google and Amazon. ( Stevey's Google Platforms Rant ) where he talked a little about Jeff‚Äôs towering genius and micromanaging style. It‚Äôs a great read, but his follow up post ( Last week I accidentally posted an internal rant about service platforms to my‚Ä¶ ) talked more about working for Jeff Bezos. I recommend that you read both, but I have provided the crux below for the too-lazy-to-click-a-link folks: Over the years I watched people give presentations to Jeff Bezos and come back bruised: emotionally, intellectually, often career-ily. If you came back with a nod or a signoff, you were jumping for joy. Presenting to Jeff is a gauntlet that tends to send people back to the cave to lick their wounds and stay out of the sunlight for a while. I say ‚Äúpresentations‚Äù and you probably think PowerPoint, but no: he outlawed PowerPoint there many years ago. It‚Äôs not allowed on the campus. If you present to Jeff, you write it as prose. One day it came time for  me  to present to Jeff. It felt like... I don‚Äôt know, maybe how they swarm around you when you‚Äôre going to meet the President. People giving you last-minute advice, wishing you luck, ushering you past regiments of admins and security guards. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre in a movie. A gladiator movie. Fortunately I‚Äôd spent years watching Jeff in action before my turn came, and I had prepared in an unusual way. My presentation -- which, roughly speaking was about the core skills a generalist engineer ought to know -- was a resounding success. He loved it. Afterwards everyone was patting me on the back and congratulating me like I‚Äôd just completed a game-winning hail-mary pass or something. One VP told me privately: ‚ÄúPresentations with Jeff  never  go that well.‚Äù [‚Ä¶] To prepare a presentation for Jeff, first make damn sure you know everything there is to know about the subject. Then write a prose narrative explaining the problem and solution(s). Write it exactly the way you would write it for a leading professor or industry expert on the subject. That is: assume he already knows  everything  about it. Assume he knows more than you do about it. Even if you have groundbreakingly original ideas in your material, just pretend it‚Äôs old hat for him. Write your prose in the succinct, direct, no-explanations way that you would write for a world-leading expert on the material. You‚Äôre almost done. The last step before you‚Äôre ready to present to him is this:  Delete every third paragraph . Now you‚Äôre ready to present! Back in the mid-1800s there was this famous-ish composer/pianist named Franz Liszt. He is widely thought to have been the greatest sight-reader who ever lived. He could sight-read  anything  you gave him, including crazy stuff not even written for piano, like opera scores. He was so staggeringly good at sight-reading that his brain was only fully engaged on the first run-through. After that he‚Äôd get bored and start embellishing with his own additions. Bezos is so goddamned smart that you have to turn it into a game for him or he‚Äôll be bored and annoyed with you. That was my first realization about him. Who knows how smart he was before he became a billionaire -- let‚Äôs just assume it was ‚Äúreally frigging smart‚Äù, since he did build Amazon from scratch. But for years he‚Äôs had armies of people taking care of  everything  for him. He doesn‚Äôt have to do anything at all except dress himself in the morning and read presentations all day long. So he‚Äôs really, REALLY good at reading presentations. He‚Äôs like the Franz Liszt of sight-reading presentations. So you have to start tearing out whole paragraphs, or even pages, to make it interesting for him. He will fill in the gaps himself without missing a beat. And his brain will have less time to get annoyed with the slow pace of  your  brain. I mean, imagine what it would be like to start off as an incredibly smart person, arguably a first-class genius, and then somehow wind up in a situation where you have a general‚Äôs view of the industry battlefield for ten years. Not only do you have more  time  than anyone else, and access to more  information  than anyone else, you also have this long-term eagle-eye  perspective  that only a handful of people in the world enjoy. In some sense you wouldn‚Äôt even be human anymore. People like Jeff are better regarded as hyper-intelligent aliens with a tangential interest in human affairs. But how do you prepare a presentation for a giant-brained alien? Well, here‚Äôs my second realization: He  will  outsmart you. Knowing everything about your subject is only a first-line defense for you. It‚Äôs like armor that he‚Äôll eat through in the first few minutes. He is going to have at least one deep insight about the subject, right there on the spot, and it‚Äôs going to make you look like a complete buffoon. Trust me folks, I saw this happen time and again, for  years . Jeff Bezos has all these incredibly intelligent, experienced domain experts surrounding him at huge meetings, and on a daily basis he thinks of shit that they  never  saw coming. It‚Äôs a guaranteed facepalm fest. So I knew he was going to think of something that I hadn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt know what it might be, because I‚Äôd spent weeks trying to think of everything. I had reviewed the material with  dozens  of people. But it didn‚Äôt matter. I knew he was going to blindside me, because that‚Äôs what happens when you present to Jeff. If you assume it‚Äôs coming, then it‚Äôs not going to catch you quite as off-guard. And of course it happened. I forgot Data Mining. Wasn‚Äôt in the list. He asked me point-blank, very nicely: ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt Data Mining and Machine Learning in this list?‚Äù And I laughed right in his face, which sent a shock wave through the stone-faced jury of VPs who had been listening in silence, waiting for a cue from Jeff as to whether he was going to be happy or I was headed for the salt mines. I laughed because I was  delighted . He‚Äôd caught me with my pants down around my ankles, right in front of everyone, despite all my excruciating weeks of preparation. I had even deleted about a third of the exposition just to keep his giant brain busy, but it didn‚Äôt matter. He‚Äôd done it again, and I looked like a total ass-clown in front of everyone. It was frigging awesome. So yeah, of course I couldn‚Äôt help laughing. And I said: ‚ÄúYup, you got me. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs not in there. It should be. I‚Äôm a dork. I‚Äôll add it.‚Äù And he laughed, and we moved on, and everything was great. Even the VPs started smiling. It annoyed the hell out of me that they‚Äôd had to wait for a cue, but whatever. Life was good. You have to understand: most people were scared around Bezos because they were waaaay too worried about trying to keep their jobs. People in high-level positions sometimes have a little too much personal self-esteem invested in their success. Can you imagine how annoying it must be for him to be around timid people all day long? But me -- well, I thought I was going to get fired every single day. So fuck timid. Might as well aim high and go out in a ball of flame. That‚Äôs where the ‚ÄúDread Pirate Bezos‚Äù line came from. I worked hard and had fun, but every day I honestly worried they might fire me in the morning. Sure, it was a kind of paranoia. But it was sort of healthy in a way. I kept my resume up to date, and I kept my skills up to date, and I never worried about saying something stupid and ruining my career. Because hey, they were most likely going to fire me in the morning.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-for-Jeff-Bezos,"Both posts were delightful reading.

Presidential Election,How did the media impact the result of the 2016 US presidential election?,"The media determines what is going to be news to their viewers.  The media actually molds what the public is going to view as important issues or not.  Since the first study of this was done in 1968, more than 300 studies have been done globally that verify this. The 2016 election cycle was no different. While voters were angry over hearing nothing about the policies that the candidates wanted to put forth, they failed to understand that the media had no interest in discussing the policies. Policy discussions are considered boring, and do not equate to ratings. For example:  Hillary Clinton‚Äôs policies made up less than 1% of the coverage she received in this election. Donald Trump received more, but not until after the conventions. What was  very  different in 2016 was that the media reported on the election much in the same way tabloids report on celebrities. Information was added or overlooked in order to obtain the best ratings possible with little regard for giving voters actual facts about stories they were reporting on. The media was very selective in what they termed to be ‚Äúnewsworthy‚Äù and facts played little in those decisions. While many claim that the media demonstrated a bias toward Clinton over Trump, that is absolutely not true.  *Image from:  Media Coverage of the Primaries Was Awful, Harvard Study Confirms While everyone is claiming that the media was biased towards Clinton, in truth,  most of what was said of Trump was either neutral or positive.  Clinton: Aside from the tone the media presented about each candidate, the media actually manipulated and encouraged the perception voters had of each candidate. The addition of campaign surrogates, that appeared to solely promote the views of their candidate, with little regard for the truth left voters with negative impressions of Clinton, and the failure of the hosts to correct false information was startling. Once the media failed to correct surrogates, and continued to perpetuate incorrect information, they actually encouraged the perception that Hillary Clinton was corrupt and responsible for events that she had nothing to do with.  Trump surrogates often brought up Benghazi in trying to turn attention from anything negative about Trump. At no time did reporters correct them and tell them that Clinton was found to have done nothing wrong in regards to Benghazi.  The media throughout the campaign could easily have reminded viewers that not only did those heading up the multiple hearings admit that nothing could have been done, but that Republican leadership admitted that these ‚Äúinvestigations‚Äù were nothing more than an attempt to destroy the high approval ratings Clinton had at the time she stepped down as Secretary of State.  In fact, in the interview where Rep. McCarthy stated that the investigations were politically motivated solely to change perception about Hillary Clinton, the reporter interrupted, trying to stop Representative McCarthy from saying more. Other reporters could have easily stopped all of the rhetoric about Benghazi, yet they let it continue, and fed into it in order to increase ratings. Not until the final few weeks of the campaign  did reporters begin to try to stop surrogates from blatant lies about Clinton. In truth, had they bothered to play the video above, this would have simply died when the surrogates tried to continue with the claims. It would have forced conversations to actually turn to policies, which would not have done as much for station ratings.  The other scandal that decimated Clinton was the  ‚ÄúEmail Scandal‚Äù . The media failed to ever actually explain the email debacle to their viewers. Voters had no idea exactly where this all became an issue, and rather than explaining it, media let misconceptions control the coverage. Had some of the information been released, perception would likely have changed about this. The media failed to accurately report on the FBI investigation. The investigation was about cybersecurity, not about her emails themselves. They failed to make clear to viewers that it is not illegal to have a private email server. The investigation was solely into how confidential information was protected. The actual problem with the private server was that work-related emails should have been turned over to the State Department by the time Clinton left office. Doing so would have avoided the issue of the private email server completely. In July, FBI Director James Comey announced that Clinton did have classified information in her emails.  The State Department stated shortly after that that Comey was wrong.  They stated that none of the information was classified at the time Clinton shared it, and that emails she received were improperly marked. They also state that 2 of the emails Comey focused on as being classified were nothing more than emails to schedule calls with other leaders. The media failed to mention any of this and clear up misunderstandings in regards to this.  The media also failed to mention that emails had been altered by  Republican leaders in an attempt to frame Clinton in regards to Benghazi,  which is where the whole email scandal erupted. It was found that Trey Gowdy had heavily redacted information that was not classified in order to give the appearance that Clinton was sharing classified information. Emails were also altered to include information that the CIA claimed was not in the original emails. Democrat leadership forced Gowdy‚Äôs hand when  Rep. Elijah Cummings sent a letter  stating he was going public with this information. Coverage of this would have clearly altered how voters viewed the multiple ‚Äúinvestigations‚Äù. Failure of the media to accurately report on any of this, created the impression that Clinton was trying to cover up information.  The scandal that Clinton faced was over Trump allegations of ‚ÄúPay for Play‚Äù with the Clinton Foundation.  Trump and his claims were wrong,  and yet the media did nothing to correct this, or to challenge the claims made. By failing to refute comments continually made by Trump and his surrogates, the media allowed the perception of Clinton being corrupt, when there was no evidence found that proved any of the allegations were correct. This is rather hypocritical when Trump himself has been caught doing this. Trump: While the failure of the media to report information hurt Hillary Clinton, the failure of the media to report information about Donald Trump clearly helped him. The media was easily manipulated by the Trump campaign. Anytime questions started being asked, Trump simply went off on a tantrum, and that replaced questions he did not want to answer.  When Donald Trump managed to read from his prompters, he was applauded as being presidential. There was much attention given to his staying on script and how that meant that by somehow reading from a prompter meant he could handle being president. While the media was focused on Comey announcing he was re-opening the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs emails, nothing was being said about the more than  75 lawsuits that Donald Trump and his businesses are still involved in.  In fact, this is the only video on Youtube about Trump facing racketeering charges with Trump University. The judge ruling on the case is the same judge that Trump disparaged in his campaign stating that he was not qualified based on his Mexican heritage. Even at the time, no comment was made by the media about possible RICO charges.  While Trump and his surrogates claimed falsely that Clinton was guilty of ‚ÄúPay for Play‚Äù,  Trump was actually caught using his own foundation to bribe the Attorney General of Florida to drop her investigation into Trump University . There has been very little coverage of this, and virtually no one in the media pointed out that this  IS  ‚ÄòPay for Play‚Äô. In fact, months after this broke, there was still no investigation into this. The media only called this  Trump‚Äôs mess , which greatly down-played exactly what was going on.  It was not until the  media became enraged  at Trump‚Äôs non-birther announcement that even a token effort was made to begin holding Trump and his campaign accountable for their comments. Until the media was on the receiving end of one of Trump‚Äôs antics, they did not seem to care about how many blatant lies the candidate told, or bother to look into his background. After this, they then began pressing about his tax returns, but still ignored other investigations.  Only  Newsweek looked into Trump‚Äôs business ties overseas . What they found is that Trump Organization has hundreds of ties in countries that can cause an instant conflict-of-interest with our Foreign policies. This was briefly reported on, but there was no follow up that should have raised questions as to the ability of the Trump Organization to avoid any conflict of interest. This should have received much more coverage than it did.  While Director Comey went public about Clinton, very little was made about the  Mother Jones story  of Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia. It is believed that this story is what Senator Reid meant when he blasted Comey and demanded that he go public with the ‚Äúexplosive‚Äù information he had about Trump and his ties to Russia. There was no coverage asking how Trump‚Äôs advisor Roger Stone had advanced knowledge of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta‚Äôs email hacking 6 weeks before that became public information. It was also falsely reported in the NY Times that the FBI found there were no ties between Trump‚Äôs private server and Russia‚Äôs Alfa Bank . Heat Street found: Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‚ÄòU.S. persons‚Äô in Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign with ties to Russia. Contrary to earlier reporting in the New York Times , which cited FBI sources as saying that the agency did not believe that  the private server in Donald Trump‚Äôs Trump Tower which was connected to a Russian bank  had any nefarious purpose, the FBI‚Äôs counter-intelligence arm, sources say, re-drew an earlier FISA court request around possible financial and banking offenses related to the server. The first request, which, sources say, named Trump, was denied back in June, but the second was drawn more narrowly and was granted in October  after evidence was presented of a server, possibly related to the Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia‚Äôs Alfa Bank.  While the  Times  story speaks of metadata, sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full content of emails and other related documents that may concern US persons. The FBI agents  who talked to the New York Times , and rubbished the ground- breaking stories of  Slate ( Franklin Foer) and  Mother Jones  (David Corn) may not have known about the FISA warrant, sources say, because the counter-intelligence and criminal sides of the FBI often work independently of each other employing the principle of ‚Äòcompartmentalization‚Äô. Get our exclusive newsletter‚Äîthe best of Heat Street every day The FISA warrant was granted in connection with the investigation of suspected activity between the server and two banks, SVB Bank and Alfa Bank. However, it is thought in the intelligence community that the warrant covers any ‚ÄòUS person‚Äô connected to this investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as his media surrogates. The warrant was sought, they say, because actionable intelligence on the matter provided by friendly foreign agencies could not properly be examined without a warrant by US intelligence as it involves ‚ÄòUS Persons‚Äô who come under the remit of the FBI and not the CIA. Should a counter-intelligence investigation lead to criminal prosecutions, sources say, the Justice Department is concerned that the chain of evidence have a basis in a clear warrant. In June, when the first FISA warrant was denied, the FBI was reportedly alarmed at Carter Page‚Äôs trip to Moscow and meetings with Russian officials, one week before the DNC was hacked. Counter intelligence agencies later reported to both Presidential candidates that Russia had carried out this hack; Donald Trump said publicly in the third debate that ‚Äòour country has no idea‚Äô if Russia did the hacking. The discovery of the Trump Tower private Russian server, however, communicating with Alfa Bank, changed matters, sources report. To further complicate the story, the FISA warrant was allegedly granted in part because of the involvement of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs own daughters. One is married to a senior official at Gazprom, where Carter Page and Paul Manafort reportedly have holdings; another to Kirill Shamalov, a banking official. The fact that the alleged warrant was a FISA warrant is itself significant. The court exists to grant warrants to examine cases concerned with Foreign Intelligence. Pursuant to FISA, the Court entertains applications submitted by the United States Government for  approval of electronic surveillance, physical search, and other investigative actions for foreign intelligence purposes.  Most of the Court‚Äôs work is conducted ex parte as required by statute, and due to the need to protect classified national security information. Bradley P. Moss is a national security lawyer. He told us: If a FISA warrant was issued, it does not necessarily mean that the court considered any U.S. persons as literal ‚Äòspies.‚Äô I can imagine an argument having been made that there was probable cause to believe they were ‚Äúagents of influence‚Äù who were unwittingly being influenced by a foreign power. If the operation concerns suspected money laundering involving a foreign government, the FISA warrant could theoretically encompass U.S. persons in that limited context. A FISA warrant is authorization to collect evidence, not to arrest. Had any of the allegations about Trump been investigated and reported on by the media in the manner they reported on Clinton‚Äôs email or Benghazi, it would have had a major impact on the election. Summary: Given that cable news is shown to be where most Americans took most of their information about the election from , it is sad that those outlets focused so little of their coverage on facts.  What most fail to wonder is what is the credibility of the news channels? We are used to accepting what we are told by ‚Äújournalists‚Äù. Should we though? PunditFact checks in on the cable news channels  PunditFact is the sister site to Politifact. This is what they found: Fox and Fox News:  60 percent of the claims checked have been rated Mostly False or worse. MSNBC and NBC News:  44 percent of claims have received a rating of Mostly False or worse. CNN News:  80 percent of of the claims rated are Half True or better. I come away feeling that the media has sold us out, especially in the 2016 election. Failure to report actual news, perpetuation of misconceptions, and allowing blatant lies in an attempt to gain more ratings than competition have resulted in a tabloid election, that clearly favored the candidate with the most tabloid experience. In the 2016 election, the media not only manipulated the news, they created the perception voters had of the candidates.",https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-media-impact-the-result-of-the-2016-US-presidential-election,"Joyce, this is a great answer in how it‚Äôs organized and presented.

Italian Restaurant,What is the best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh?,"This is going to be a highly controversial answer, because people have very strong opinions about this restaurant both good and bad.  I am going to say Del's at 4428 Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield.  I love Del's for the food, the ambiance, and the staff.  The food is always excellent, made with fresh ingredients from the Strip District and house made sauces.  Two words: mafalda sauce.  Anything with it is a winner.  The restaurant is warm and friendly, with the atosphere of a family holiday where maybe your relatives are drinking a little too much.  There is a dinning area and a separate bar where you may actually find your relatives drinking too much!  Finally, the owners and staff are some of the friendliest and most Italian-eccentric people around.  What sums Del's up for me is a time when I was eating at the bar and a very old women came in with a big plate of fresh biscotti.  After having a loud conversation in Italian with the owner, who passed out biscottis to everyone at the bar, the women left.  The owner then revealed that she had loaned the women some money in the '80s and she's been delivering biscottis ever since!

Calisthenic Switzerland,"Do American soldiers sometimes get special treatment due to fear of the U.S. when they are captured by enemies, as compared to other countries‚Äô soldiers?","No! Were US POWs Starved to Death in German Camps? Reports of the Allied advance in Europe in spring 1945 raised concerns about the treatment of prisoners of war. July 23, 2018  Background:  During World War II, an estimated 90,0000 Americans were held as prisoners of war (POWs) in Germany. Once captured, the POWs were first processed through a  Dulag  (transit camp) where, according to the Geneva Convention signed in 1929, they were required to give their name, rank, and serial number. They were then sent to the actual POW camps, which were sometimes divided among different types of camps such as Marlag ( Marinelager ), a prison camp for naval servicemen; Oflag ( Offizierslager ), a camp for officers; Stalag ( Stammlager ), a camp for officers and enlisted men.  Map of the major POWs camps in Germany. Image: Cindy Farrar Bryan and  TheArrowheadClub.com . Under the Geneva Convention, officers were not required to work but enlisted men were often made to work, often in difficult conditions. While Allied POWs were subjected to harassment, beating, starving and sometimes death in German camps, their situation was altogether more tolerable than in the Pacific. Over 40% of the American POWs in the Pacific perished, compared to between 1 and 2% in Germany. The main concerns were shortages of food; the meager rations POWs received from the Germans were supplemented by the more than 27 million parcels sent by the Red Cross during the war.  Standard content of a Red Cross parcel. In the USA, the parcels were assembled by more than 13,000 volunteers in distribution centers such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis, and sent to the International Red Cross Committee in Geneva, Switzerland, for distribution in roughly 60 POW camps in Germany.
The packages contained nonperishable foods like prunes, raisins, liver p√¢t√©, coffee, corned beef, sugar, dried milk, oleomargarine, biscuits, orange concentrate, cheese, canned salmon or tuna fish and chocolate bars, along with amenities like cigarettes and soap.

In an enormous logistical feat, POWs at first received one Red Cross parcel per week, greatly alleviating the plights of the POWs. Results:  Source: Gallup Poll, May 1945,  Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at Cornell University. What Happened : As the war progressed, the logistics of delivering the parcels became insurmountable. The German planes that flew daily from Lisbon, Portugal (a neutral country), to Germany carrying air mail to POWS were cut off after the liberation of France in the summer of 1944. In addition, surface mail and next-of-kin parcels, which were formerly shipped to Marseille, France, were stalled from June to October 1944. Fighting along the Marseille-Switzerland line made it almost impossible to move mail into or out of Switzerland (a neutral country). As a result, POWs experienced long periods in later 1944-early 1945 where they received no Red Cross parcels and no news from home. The few rations they received were woefully inadequate as the fierce fighting on the continent led to a tripling of the numbers of American POWs. When the Allied liberated their first POW camps in April 1945, they found prisoners in different states of poor conditions: recently imprisoned men who survived on a few slices of bread a week, those who had been in prison for a long time and suffered from the harsh conditions and the poor diet, while others, who had been on forced marches, sometimes 600 miles long, from the east as the Germans moved them inland, were in even worse shape. The Allies themselves, and future historians, however, found no documented effort by the Germans to purposefully starve or kill American POWS. The situation was different for eastern, especially Russian prisoners of war. It is estimated that about 3.5 million, or 57% of all Soviet POWs died in German custody. The results of this May 1945 poll can be explained by the fact that in April and early May 1945, there were numerous reports of Allied forces liberating concentration camps. The deliberate killing and starving of camp inmates was widely reported and may have been conflated with news of Prisoners of War camps by the American public. Articles such as the ones below use words such as ‚Äúsemi-starvation,‚Äù ‚Äúslave labor,‚Äù mistreatment and appalling sanitary condition, when reporting on both POWs camps and concentration camps.

Photograph:  World War II Database: Your WW2 History Reference Destination For a while after the end of the second world war, Toshio Tono could not bear to be in the company of doctors. And the thought of putting on a white coat filled him with dread. As a young man with an interest in gynaecology, it was an aversion that could have quickly ended his dream of a career in medicine. But there were powerful reasons behind his phobia. In 1945, as a first-year student at Kyushu Imperial University‚Äôs medical school in southern  Japan , Tono became an unwilling witness to atrocities. Those atrocities ‚Äì namely the dreadful medical experimentation on live American prisoners of war ‚Äì decades later, continue to provoke revulsion and disbelief in his country and abroad.  The man who survived Hiroshima: 'I had entered a living hell on earth' Read more As Japan prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of its wartime defeat on Saturday, speculation is building over how, or if, Shinzo Abe, the conservative prime minister, will apologise for his country‚Äôs wartime atrocities. Amid widespread criticism, including in the US, that under Abe Japan is attempting to expunge the worst excesses of its past brutality from the collective memory, Tono believes his ‚Äúfinal job‚Äù is to shed light on one of the darkest chapters in his country‚Äôs modern history. In early May 1945, just weeks after he began his studies, a US B-29 Superfortress crashed in northern Kyushu island after being rammed by a Japanese fighter plane. The US plane, part of the 29th Bomb Group, 6th Bomb Squadron, had been returning to its base in Guam from a bombing mission against a Japanese airfield. One of the estimated 12 crew died when the cords of his parachute were sliced by another Japanese plane. On landing, another opened fire on villagers before turning his pistol on himself. Local people, incensed by the destruction the B-29s were visiting on Japanese cities, reportedly killed another two airmen on the ground. ‚ÄúThe B-29s crews were hated in those days,‚Äù Tono, now the 89-year-old director of a maternity clinic in Fukuoka, told the Guardian in a recent interview.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Toshio Tono, who now heads a maternity clinic. Photograph: Justin McCurry/Guardian The remaining airmen were rounded up by police and placed in military custody in the nearby city of Fukuoka. The squadron‚Äôs commander, Marvin Watkins, was sent to Tokyo for questioning. There, Watkins endured beatings at the hands of his interrogators, and is thought to have died in his native Virgnia in the late 1980s. The prisoners were led to believe they were going to receive treatment for their injuries. But over the following three weeks, they were to be subjected to a depraved form of pathology at the medical school ‚Äì procedures to which Tono is the only surviving witness. ‚ÄúOne day two blindfolded prisoners were brought to the school in a truck and taken to the pathology lab,‚Äù Tono said. ‚ÄúTwo soldiers stood guard outside the room. I did wonder if something unpleasant was going to happen to them, but I had no idea it was going to be that awful.‚Äù Inside, university doctors, at the urging of local military authorities, began the first of a series of experiments that none of the eight victims would survive. According to testimony  that was later used against the doctors and military personnel at the Allied War Crimes Tribunals, they injected one anaesthetised prisoner with seawater to see if it worked as a substitute for sterile saline solution. Other airmen had parts of their organs removed, with one deprived of an entire lung to gauge the effects of surgery on the respiratory system. In another experiment, doctors drilled through the skull of a live prisoner, apparently to determine if epilepsy could be treated by the removal of part of the brain. The tribunals also heard claims from US lawyers that the liver of one victim had been removed, cooked and served to officers, although all charges of cannibalism were later dropped owing to a lack of evidence. As an inexperienced medical student, Tono‚Äôs job was to wash the blood from the operating theatre floor and prepare seawater drips. ‚ÄúThe experiments had absolutely no medical merit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey were being used to inflict as cruel a death as possible on the prisoners. ‚ÄúI was in a state of panic, but I couldn‚Äôt say anything to the other doctors. We kept being reminded of the misery US bombing raids had caused in Japan. But looking back it was a terrible thing to have happened.‚Äù Medical staff preserved the POWs‚Äô corpses in formaldehyde for future use by students, but at the end of the war the remains were quickly cremated, as doctors attempted to hide evidence of their crimes. When later questioned by US authorities, they claimed the airmen had been transferred to camps in Hiroshima and had died in the atomic bombing on 6 August. On the afternoon of 15 August, hours after the emperor had announced Japan‚Äôs surrender, more than a dozen other American POWs held in Fukuoka camps were taken to a mountainside execution site and beheaded. The macabre experiments at Kyushu University were not without precedent. In occupied China, members of the imperial army‚Äôs Unit 731 experimented on thousands of live Chinese and Russian POWs and civilians as part of Japan‚Äôs chemical and biological weapons programme. Of the 30 Kyushu University doctors and military staff who stood trial in 1948, 23 were convicted of vivisection and the wrongful removal of body parts. Five were sentenced to death and another four to life imprisonment. But they were never punished. They were the beneficiaries of the slow pace of justice as US-led occupation authorities attempted to deal with large numbers of military leaders and civilian collaborators suspected of war crimes. One of the most senior doctors, Fukujiro Ishiyama, killed himself before his trial. By the early 1950s the Korean peninsula was in the midst of a bloody civil war, while Japan had been officially recognised as a US ally under the terms of the San Francisco peace treaty. With a politically stable Japan regarded as key to preventing the spread of communism in the region,  President Truman issued an executive order  that led to freedom for imprisoned war criminals, including those awaiting execution. By the end of 1958, all Japanese war criminals had been released and began reinventing themselves, some as mainstream politicians, under their new, US-authored constitution. ‚ÄúThe way Japan was during the war, it was impossible to refuse orders from the military,‚Äù Tono said. ‚ÄúDr Ishiyama and the other doctors committed crimes, but in a way they were also victims of the war. But I hated doctors for a while. I couldn‚Äôt get to sleep without pills.‚Äù After the war, Tono spent years examining documents and revisiting relevant locations in an attempt to establish what had happened. Ignoring pleas from his former superiors not to disclose the truth about the POWs‚Äô treatment, Tono revealed all in Disgrace, his meticulously researched account of the crimes. Like the leaders of Unit 731, the doctors who conducted live vivisection re-entered postwar society as respectable members of the medical community. Most never spoke of their wartime experiences. Earlier this year, the university, which has long since dropped its imperial title, made the surprising decision to acknowledge the darkest chapter in its history with the inclusion  of vivisection exhibits at its new museum . Tono, too, is currently  displaying photographs and documents  at his clinic. Seven decades on, a simple stone monument erected by a local farmer marks the spot where the B-29 came down, and where the airmen‚Äôs terrifying ordeal began. ‚ÄúThe job of a doctor is to help people, but here were doctors doing exactly the opposite,‚Äù Tono said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to accept, but this really happened. I decided to tell the truth because I don‚Äôt want anything like this to ever happen again.‚Äù What War Captives Faced
In Japanese Prison Camps,
And How U.S. RespondedBy  JESS BRAVIN
 Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
April 7, 2005After his B-24 Liberator crashed into the Pacific Ocean in May 1943, U.S. Army Capt. Louis Zamperini spent 47 days on a life raft before being rescued by a Japanese patrol boat. Then his ordeal really began.Shipped through a succession of prison camps, he finally arrived at Japan's secret Ofuna interrogation center. There, prisoners thought to hold critical intelligence were placed under a strict regimen designed to make them break. Solitary confinement, blindfolding and compulsory calisthenics were routine. Prisoners were shaved and stripped, forbidden from speaking to each other and made to stand at attention or assume uncomfortable positions for interrogations. Cooperate, and treatment might improve. Violate the rules and you might be slapped or beaten -- or worse.""There was no such thing as international law, just Japanese law,"" says Mr. Zamperini, now 88 years old. Japan had never ratified the Geneva Conventions, and Ofuna inmates were told they had no treaty protections -- such as the right to reveal nothing but name, rank and serial number.Upon Tokyo's surrender, however, the U.S. declared that international law did apply -- and held accountable much of the Japanese hierarchy, from prison guards to cabinet ministers. U.S. military prosecutors brought hundreds of cases for mistreatment of captured Americans, failure to classify them as prisoners of war and hiding them from delegations of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Offenses as minor as failing to post camp rules or holding up a prisoner's meal were considered war crimes. A single count could bring a year at hard labor.""The defendants in these cases, as you would expect in most contexts of war, believed that the circumstances justified what they were doing,"" says Prof. David Cohen of the University of California, Berkeley, who has been collecting trial records from around the world for a  War Crimes Studies Center  he founded in 2000. Summary Executions Although Nuremberg and other postwar tribunals largely are remembered for prosecuting the Nazi leadership for crimes against humanity, the trials originated in the mistreatment of prisoners of war. It was the German practice of summarily executing downed Allied flyers that in 1944 led Washington to begin planning for war-crimes prosecutions.
Ofuna prison camp, where American prisoners were interrogated during World War II. Image courtesy ""Devil at My Heels,"" the memoir of POW Louis Zamperini. Other than the flyers, Prof. Cohen says, American and British soldiers captured by the Germans usually received adequate treatment. (Russian POWs fared far worse, under Nazi racial policies that considered Slavs subhuman.)Prisoners of the Japanese, however, faced grueling treatment across the board. Forced labor, meager rations and poor medical care were the rule, along with occasional beheadings by samurai sword and even incidents of cannibalism.But as the U.S. saw it, mistreatment didn't have to rise to the level of torture to merit punishment. For conditions that fell short of torture, prosecutors brought charges under the sweeping Geneva provision that barred ""any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind."" Along with routine beatings, Japanese interrogators had used solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, blindfolding, head shaving, restricting meals, uncomfortable positions and other techniques to make prisoners talk. Japan failed to register some prisoners or facilities with the Red Cross, delayed delivering their mail or Red Cross packages and denied some Americans POW privileges without full-blown judicial proceedings.Japanese regulations required that prisoners of war ""be humanely treated and in no case shall any insult or maltreatment be inflicted."" In a February 1942 diplomatic note, Tokyo told Washington that while Japan held ""no obligations"" under the Geneva Conventions, it nevertheless intended to apply ""corresponding similar stipulations of the treaty"" to captured Americans. When complaints arrived from the foreign governments or the Red Cross, which then as now was the only independent group allowed to visit prisoners, officials forwarded them to military authorities. Soda Pop and a Biscuit Mr. Zamperini, who still lives in his hometown of Los Angeles, says his first encounters with Japanese interrogators were hardly pleasant, but to his surprise, ""they didn't beat you to get information out of you"" -- at least not always.
Louis Zamperini, held by the Japanese during World War II, in a 2003 photo. After subsisting on a diet of plain rice, Mr. Zamperini was led before ""naval officers in white suits with gold braid"" who sat feasting at ""a table full of goodies."" Refuse to answer and they sent ""you back to your cell more miserable than when you started."" To get some of the food, Mr. Zamperini says he used a ruse, pretending to crack under pressure and then offering misleading information about the location of U.S. airstrips. ""I got a soda pop and I got a biscuit, so I won,"" he says.U.S. military commissions classified practices like these as war crimes. ""Any corporal punishment, any imprisonment in quarters without daylight and, in general, any form of cruelty is forbidden,"" an Army judge advocate explained.Government-appointed defense attorneys protested the vagueness of some charges. Threatening prisoners with ""unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment ‚Ä¶ does not constitute any war crime,"" one argued. ""It does not allege any specific act."" The attorney recalled his own World War I experience as a U.S. interrogator. ""We tried by all manner of words and all manner of inducements -- I will not go beyond that -- to attempt to glean information which would be helpful in our operations against the enemy,"" he said, and no one considered it a war crime.""We looked this up very carefully,"" the prosecutor replied. ""When you start to threaten a man, of course you violate the provisions of the Rules of Land Warfare."" The commission ruled for the prosecution.The World War II defendants insisted that they hadn't received proper training, or that prisoners exaggerated their mistreatment, or that any problems resulted from cultural misunderstandings or were appropriate punishment for breaking camp rules. Low-ranking guards claimed they were following superior orders, while top officers and cabinet ministers blamed rogue subordinates. Defense lawyers argued that Japan wasn't legally bound by the Geneva Conventions and, even if it were, many prisoners, such as Allied flyers, had no right to treaty protections because they committed such war crimes as sabotage or ""indiscriminate bombing"" of cities. Hundreds of Trials While the international tribunals at Tokyo and Nuremberg focused on a handful of high-ranking Axis defendants, hundreds of lower-profile national military commissions tried the small fry. For instance, in November 1945, a British military court at Wuppertal, Germany, sentenced three German officers to terms of up to five years for crimes at a Luftwaffe interrogation center. The central offense: ""excessive heating of the prisoners' cells ‚Ä¶ for the deliberate purpose of obtaining from the prisoners of war information of a kind which under the Geneva Convention they were not bound to give,"" according to the summary published in 1948 by the United Nations War Crimes Commission.
""POW asleep, Ofuna"" (1945) by John Goodchild, Australian war artist. At Yokohama, Japan, meanwhile, the U.S. Army conducted more than 300 war-crimes trials through 1948. More than 90% involved prisoner mistreatment, says Berkeley's Prof. Cohen. American prosecutors focused on Ofuna, a secret interrogation camp run by the Imperial Navy for pilots and other high value prisoners, including Col. Gregory ""Pappy"" Boyington, the Marine Corps flying ace. Using affidavits and testimony from former prisoners, prosecutors depicted a grim world where men were broken through physical and psychological cruelty.When Japan failed to cooperate with the Red Cross, the U.S. considered it a war crime. Lt. Gen. Hiroshi Tamura, head of prisoner management, was sentenced to eight years hard labor for, in part, ""refusing and failing to grant permission"" to the Red Cross to visit prison camps, denying Red Cross delegates ""access to all premises"" where prisoners were held and refusing to let prisoners speak to the Red Cross without Japanese observers present.Japanese authorities told Ofuna prisoners that they weren't POWs but unarmed ""belligerents"" who weren't entitled to Geneva's protections. Navy aviator James Balch testified that an interrogator ""explained to me that I wasn't a registered prisoner of war, that I was a special prisoner of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and was, as far as the Japanese were concerned, still a combatant.""Lawyers for the Japanese defendants argued that since some captured Americans ""lost the status of POWs in that they were saboteurs,"" it was no war crime to withhold POW privileges from them, Army records say. A military commission rejected that argument as ""untenable"" because ""there is no evidence of any judicial proceedings against the ‚Ä¶ victims for the alleged acts of sabotage by which they would be deprived of their status"" as POWs. The 'Ofuna Crouch' Japanese interrogators put captured Americans in painful contortions for periods of 30 minutes to several hours. One hated position, the so-called Ofuna crouch, involved ""standing on the ball of your foot, knees half bent and arms extended over the head,"" Navy Lt. Cmdr. John Fitzgerald said in a  http://deposition.In  an affidavit, Navy Capt. Arthur Maher recounted his treatment after his ship, the USS Houston, was sunk in February 1942 off Indonesia. Captured after swimming to Java, Capt. Maher said Japanese officers ""promised that we would be treated in accordance with international law.""Upon reaching Ofuna, things were different. ""As we entered the camp gates, the utter stillness was noticeable."" The Americans were told not to speak, locked in nine-by-six-foot cells and put to a stultifying routine of closely timed meals, exhausting calisthenics and limited chances to wash up. Prisoners were given just one cigarette a day and had to smoke it immediately, Capt. Maher said. Many of the guards, he said, ""were sadists, some obviously cowards who did not wish to see battle,"" he said. ""A few were definitely decent and tried to alleviate our condition.""During interrogations, ""prisoners were required to sit at rigid attention and were never allowed to relax,"" Capt. Maher said. ""At times, a cigarette would be offered in an attempt to throw you off guard. Interrogators used different tactics to obtain results. Some tried flattery, cajolery and sympathy; others used threats of violence. But the prisoner was never allowed to forget that he was in a subservient position and there was nothing that he could do about it,"" he said.Mail between prisoners and their families was restricted to a trickle of censored letters, Capt. Maher said. ""This flagrant violation of international law caused great anxiety on the parts of the relatives of all prisoners in Ofuna. The Japanese frequently referred to the fact that we could write as soon as we left Ofuna, using that as an added incentive to talk and be rewarded by being sent to a regular prisoner-of-war camp.""At trial, Japanese officials insisted they had done nothing wrong. The chief of naval intelligence, Rear Adm. Kaoru Takeuchi testified that he had ordered that prisoners be treated well.""I had a pamphlet named 'How to Interrogate Prisoners of War' compiled,"" he said. ""The main points in the book"" were ""to respect international law. Not to mistreat prisoners of war. And to conduct the interrogation in a free, conversational manner."" To make sure staff got the message, he had these passages ""printed in gothic letters and underlined it with a black line,"" he said. Moreover, abusing the prisoners was ineffective. ""Since Anglo-Saxons would not betray their countries, it would be no use to force them to talk,"" the admiral testified.Officers were held liable for their subordinates' mistreatment of prisoners -- even if they tried to stop the abuse. Camp commander Suichi Takata ""took immediate action and investigated all complaints made by the POW officers as to abuses committed upon POWs, reprimanding the guilty,"" and also ""tried to correct the food situation and living conditions in the camp,"" concluded Army reviewer George Taylor. Two former prisoners -- the senior American and British officers held there -- wrote letters recommending clemency. In view of such ""mitigating circumstances,"" Mr. Taylor recommended that Mr. Takata's punishment be reduced -- to 15 years at hard labor, from the original sentence of 40 years.Half the time, Army reviewers found the commissions too lenient and recommended that harsher sentences be imposed. On occasion, though, they accepted defense arguments. Prison guard Masatomo Kikuchi was convicted of compelling prisoners ""to practice saluting and other forms of arduous military exercises on their rest days and at other times when they were tired."" The reviewer concluded that ""drilling a detail of men for 15 or 30 minutes ‚Ä¶ is so universally utilized in the armies of the world to teach discipline and for exercise that it would be unjust and unreasonable to consider it a war crime."" 'No Serious Injury' Moreover, the reviewer found that the commission had overreached in convicting Mr. Kikuchi of two ""beatings."" In fact, testimony showed ""that the mistreatment consisted of a series of slappings."" Since ""no serious injury was sustained by any of the POWs as a result of his mistreatment,"" Mr. Kikuchi's sentence was cut to eight years hard labor, from 12.Cmdr. Sashizo Yokura, an Ofuna interrogator, testified that he opposed beating American prisoners, even though beatings commonly were used to discipline Japanese soldiers. He said he had learned from an interpreter who studied in the U.S. that, while ""the Japanese think that beating is the simplest punishment when someone violates a regulation, ‚Ä¶ the Americans consider beatings as the greatest humiliation."" Moreover, he said, beatings were counterproductive, as prisoners wasted interrogators' time bemoaning their treatment.CASE FILE

Prosecutors, however, contended that Cmdr. Yokura had subtly signaled guards to soften up prisoners for interrogation. Specifically, they introduced evidence that in December 1944, Cmdr. Yokura delayed the meal of a captured B-29 flyer, Maj. H.A. Walker, and forced him to perform  kampan soji , an awkward floor-cleaning exercise using a no-handle mop that typically was used to discipline Japanese sailors. These acts, prosecutors argued, contributed to Maj. Walker's ""death by inches"" nine months later, after he had been severely beaten by guards and denied medical attention.Cmdr. Yokura's defense attorney, Michael Braun, challenged this theory in his closing argument. ""We all regret the death of Maj. Walker, just as we regret the deaths of 250,000 to 300,000 other Americans who died in the past war,"" he said. ""But the fact that a man died in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp does not automatically mean that any Japanese brought to trial theoretically for his death is guilty of it."" Cmdr. Yokura denied holding up Maj. Walker's meal, but even if he had, Mr. Braun argued, he would have been justified because Maj. Walker refused to give his name, rank and serial number, as required by the Geneva Conventions. The U.S. Army's own Rules of Land Warfare authorized ""food restrictions as punishment,"" he  http://observed.Mr . Braun urged the military commission not to apply a double standard. ""The eyes of the world are focused on what America does here,"" and ""whatever we do is going to be carefully read, carefully scanned, carefully measured against the principles we enunciate.""The commission sentenced Cmdr. Yokura to 25 years at hard labor. Post-War Lessons In 1949, the lessons of World War II trials were incorporated into international law. But following Sept. 11, 2001, Bush administration lawyers reexamined the degree of force and cruelty that could be used to interrogate prisoners captured in the war against terrorism. An April 2003 interrogation policy approved by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld listed permissible methods including 20-hour interrogations, ""dietary manipulation,"" ""isolation,"" ""sleep deprivation,"" ""face slap/stomach slap,"" and ""prolonged standing.""Mr. Zamperini, the former Japanese prisoner, says that in today's war on terrorism, severe treatment of the enemy might be called for.""You've got a bunch of religious cutthroats that don't follow rules and regulations,"" he says, and ""if it's a question of saving a lot of lives, then torture would be in keeping"" with the country's best interest. ""This is a whole new ballgame,"" he says.

The German treatment of Soviet prisoners on the Eastern Front was simply bestial and murderous and I will leave it at that. (The Soviets acted the same way to Axis prisoners). Each side killed millions of prisoners. The Germans in the West were a more interesting story. The start of WWII in the West resulted in hundreds of thousands of French, Belgium, English, and Dutch POWs by the Germans. Almost immediately after this huge haul of Allied prisoners the German air force suffered the capture of thousands of its pilots and crews shot down over Britain. It is important to note the Herman Goering, the head of the Luftwaffe (and second in command of Germany early in the war) was the head of POW camps in the West (not in the East). Goering therefore had thousands of ‚Äúhis‚Äù aircrews in Allied hands. Goering‚Äùs treatment of American and English (not French) POWs was, almost always, in strict compliance with the Geneva Convention (which both Germany and the Western Allies had signed-Not the USSR). The Germans made a number of massive hauls of UK POWs in France, Greece, Norway, Crete, North Africa, and Market-Garden. The Germans made only two large captures of American personnel (other than bomber crews), Kasserine Pass and the Battle of the Bulge. The United States provided a constant supply of air crew POWs from shot down bombers from 1943 until the end of the war. Unfortunately, the British, through bad aircraft design, supplied a lot more bodies than POWs from shot down British bombers. Though the Western Allies were killing German civilians in the hundreds of thousands in mass city raids Goering (A Pour le Merit winner in WWI) kept Allied aircrews safe in POW camps through the war. In late 1944‚Äì5, rations were severely reduced for Allied personnel (as they were for German troops) because of the loss of agricultural assets of the Reich in both the East (Ukraine) and the West (France/Belgium) Since POW rations were a set percentage of the capturing countries soldiers rations (I think it was 2/3 but I might be wrong) the Western Allied POWs suffered towards the end of the war from reduced rations just like Germans did. Axis POWs held in England (not to many-most were shipped to the US both to prevent escape and to provide easier provision of rations) did not do so good food wise, but, again, they were fed essentially the same as UK soldiers in Britain. Axis POWs in the US hit the jackpot not only because US soldier rations were spectacular compared to British rations (or German rations) but most German enlisted men worked on US farms which provided a huge source of food that most Axis prisoners had never seen in their lives. Goering, when he was captured by the Allies in 1945, was surprised and angry at his treatment by the Western Allies because he thought his careful treatment of Western POWs deserved to be rewarded.",,,,
Calisthenic Switzerland,Why does the East hope for peace and prosperity while the West advocate wars and prosperity?,"Why does the East hope for peace and prosperity while the West advocate wars and prosperity?  Times of India Feeding monopolies and zombies: Made in the USA: Socialism for the Rich. Capitalism for the Rest Actually it is quite apparent to well informed observers why this question is phrased in such terms. It is a reflection of the times when the unipolar world is facing the uncomfortable prospect of a multipolar world. When that really happens, the western economies are faced with some very significant head-scratching choices concerning their economies and financial interests. The western economic model carries with it significant inequality, with the few stockpiling up most of the spoils of development and generation of wealth. The Chinese government recognises this and is not interested because it is a dangerous model to follow completely. This causes a great deal of distress and handwringing in western elite circles because their dream, like George Soros illustrates, is that the Chinese would privatise their economy the way the Washington Consensus neoliberal economies did, really carve it up and the Western Multinationals would walk right in, buy up and control the commanding heights. How nice. Foreign FDI would get the profits of Chinese industry, Chinese labour, Chinese innovation and their bankers would sit right up there with their Moet & Chandon as the China stock market does a remarkable run up like Russia did in 1994-96, before it crashes. Except that Xi Jinping says- NO GO. Because Chinese hard labour accumulated this surplus and should benefit its own citizens. So Soros goes on a rant and a tear. POOR GUY. He needs to get another girlfriend since this one went off with some young stud. What is the difference between earning righteous incomes and saving up surplus wealth for more capital formation by producing goods and services to sell at a profit in contrast to just buying a property or land and letting it rise in price without the landlord doing anything, or getting a monopoly in some service or business and then just raise the prices like what pharmaceuticals in USA are using for insulin prices. Pity them poor diabetics. The former is productive investment, the latter is unproductive investment. The Chinese government knows that, and that is why they keep saying that houses are for living in, not for speculation. In contrast, the major hedge funds are so loaded with money now, they are buying up distressed properties in the USA, doing some renovation and waiting for the next price updraft. China‚Äôs economists read history which goes even back before Marx, Adam Smith and John S Mill and so on, and they watch as the Fed and BOJ and ECB does all this calisthenics with their QE. Because those countries with the WCM model (the advanced economies, not the poor suffering cousins who came late to the party) know that you can get rich quicker with financial manipulation of Wall Street than you can actually create real wealth with hard labour and humming up cars and iPhones. You can bet against the BOE, drive down sterling and make a killing, get a free lunch easy peasy. Or even buy up the NHS using the printing press of the Fed, and get them poor Brits to poney up hard earned cash for insulin. The USA is not an industrial economy, they are a rentier economy using their printed money for landlordism and bank credit and money /financial transfers and monopolies. And the Chinese politburo says No to the housing price inflation due to credit creation and finance or you will have mass tented cities in the future. And they are going for the Hong Kong property billionaires now that they got fed up with the riots in 2019. So Evergrande is just what they want to do to show these billionaires that you can get rich but don‚Äôt create systemic risk or we will wring you dry. In China there is an ongoing process of e-evaluating, restructuring, fixing up and improving the economy and doing reforms as necessary. Well now is the time to answer your question. The Western model has been partly a road of economic predation of colonialism in the past and in the most recent decades has also been on economic destruction of countries which dared to confront them, especially in the Middle East and the Global South and Asia, but the USA is not averse to break up Europe when it serves their purpose as when EU launched their Euro. So now they are trying to force countries which do not follow their WCM neoliberal order by imposing all their penalties, sanctions, military threats and even ISIS terrorism. If you wish to read about western terrorism, you can easily get tons of data, but the vast majority of people in the western and Japan economies are comfortable where they are so they will not do themselves this ‚Äòdisservice‚Äô. Because this is socialism, and to the comfortable citizen it is anathema, unless you are rich enough and have smaller populations as in Norway or some Scandinavian countries or Switzerland. Which is why you have the Cold War now. East Asia and even South Asia or Latin America and Africa needs peace to develop, but the west is now facing the mother of all stagflation possibilities as its massive Quantitative Easing comes home to roost. So the USA is going to have high priced health care and rentier private education and a big fight over infrastructure because one side wants a monopoly for rent and the other side does not. The US and many of the satellites in Europe are just not competitive economies anymore because of financial capitalism. So it becomes --- Threat, Threat, and Threat. Financial or Military or AUKUS or QUAD or whatever is the flavour of the day. Democracy is just another flavour for Wall Street oligarchs because they are the guys behind all this central planning. It is just feudalism in disguise. The most dangerous facet is the Military Industrial Complex and the neocon liberal agenda. If they get their mindset wrong they will commit the world to the unthinkable. Because the next WWIII will involve all the continents, mind you, nothing will escape. If they lob bombs at China, they will do Russia the favour too, and there goes Europe NATO, and don‚Äôt think India will get off scot free because they are just collateral damage as well as Pakistan and Israel. Aussie leaders just did their country a disservice by setting up a prism target for their Pine Gap and other stations and AUKUS, and poor NZ will have to bear the agony of being neighbours. I guess that leaves Africa and Latin America, but with so much nuclear winter, probably it is not going to be very comfortable.

Investopedia on John Stuart Mill Principles of Political Economy For Mill, economics is closely tied to social philosophy and politics: Wealth is the natural end product of labor, but the distribution of wealth is determined by the decisions and the will of actual people (albeit an elite class of educated people). As a result, human laws and institutions can and should determine how wealth is distributed. Mill did believe in the superiority of socialism, in which economic production would be driven by worker-owned cooperatives. But he also believed in free enterprise, competition, and individual initiative. Governments had a responsibility to maintain these things, as well as to prevent monopolies, look after the poor, and provide an education for young people.

Presidential Election,What are the best tweets about the 2012 Presidential election?,Got a kick out of this one:  ,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-tweets-about-the-2012-Presidential-election,,,,,
Presidential Election,"In the 2012 U.S. presidential election, should I vote for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, and why?","For me, the answer is comes down to this:  Barack Obama (politician)  could have been the kind of President who co-opted the best ideas from the Republicans, in so doing denying them an argument and coasting to a second term. Given the desperate economic conditions when Obama took office, reducing the deficit from its $1 trillion+ highs should have been very doable. In so doing, he could have stolen the mantle of fiscal responsibility from the Republicans while keeping government spending at an historically high percentage of GDP. He chose not to, and his choice speaks volumes about his priorities. Long-term deficits and debt are not his primary concern.   The President has instead waged a campaign on tangential issues designed to maximize turnout among his liberal base -- contraception and funding for public television -- which have little bearing on the serious long-term fiscal challenges facing America. His strategy is cynically designed to win 50.01% of the vote -- and no more.  Obama's presidency bears almost no resemblance to that of the man he has brought in to save his campaign, Bill Clinton. Clinton recognized the need to cut spending along with raising taxes, and pursued a stimulus package one fiftieth the size of Obama's in his first weeks in office. Faced with an obstinate Republican opposition, Clinton found ways to outmaneuver them and win the war of public opinion. At best, Obama has fought Congressional Republicans to a bloody stalemate, and this speaks to his lack of political persistence and creativity off the stump.  Obama's defenders will argue that never before has the opposition been so dogged or destructive, but this is really an admission of Obama's ineffectiveness. Clinton was able to overcome an energized Republican opposition that shut down the government. George W. Bush was able to get a lot done domestically in his first term in office even against a divided Congress. Good leaders are usually able to find a way to strongarm and maneuver their way against tough opposition. In fact, that's their job.  Mitt Romney (politician)  is a smart and highly capable executive who approaches public policy with seriousness and a lack of gimmickry. While you couldn't imagine Obama filling the role of moderate consensus-builder after the way he has performed in the last four years, you could easily see Romney in this role. (Mind you, this is not exactly the kind of Republican President I would ideally prefer -- I think every single line item in the Federal budget needs to see real-dollar cuts, including defense.)  Given the gravity of the country's fiscal situation, Mitt Romney strikes me as the adult in the room whose interest lies in actually solving the problem.",https://www.quora.com/In-the-2012-U-S-presidential-election-should-I-vote-for-Barack-Obama-or-Mitt-Romney-and-why,What about that whole adopt the Republican healthcare plan from 1996 thing?,"You have put in words the disappointment felt by many voters, including a huge number who don't think of themselves as loyal to the Republican Party.  I do agree that Clinton, the better politician in so many possible comparisons, outmaneuvered the Republican House in the court of public opinion. I don't think, however, that he would have recognized any need to cut spending if he had been spared the midterm correction phenomenon so prominent in 1994 and 2010. I believe he now gets credit for fiscal policies that came out of the House.",""" Barack Obama (politician)  could have been the kind of President who co-opted the best ideas from the Republicans"" - like adopting the AEI-designed Romneycare, or a stimulus that was 1/3 tax cuts? ""he could have stolen the mantle of fiscal responsibility from the Republicans"" - in what world do Republicans, whose Presidents have run up the national debt to record levels repeatedly, have any standing to talk about fiscal responsibility? George W. inherited surpluses - imagine! surpluses! - from his Democratic predecessor, which he frittered away on unnecessary wars he never even tried to pay for, and a mammoth Medicare giveaway to drug companies. ""a campaign on tangential issues ... which have little bearing on the serious long-term fiscal challenges facing America"" - like a universal health-care plan that undercuts the biggest source of ballooning future deficits, or cap-and-trade and higher MPG standards that address the single greatest long-term threat to the planet? ""At best, Obama has fought Congressional Republicans to a bloody stalemate, and this speaks to his lack of political persistence and creativity off the stump."" - no, it's largely the result of a GOP strategy designed from the beginning to deny the President any substantive accomplishments, backed by more Congressional obstruction than any previous Congress in American history. As one of the architects of that strategy - or at worst, as a good friend of most of those architects - you're well aware of all this, Patrick. ""George W. Bush was able to get a lot done domestically in his first term in office even against a divided Congress"" - well, partly because of 9/11, and partly because Democrats are simply much more interested in compromise than today's GOP is. To deny this is to deny objective reality. ""While you couldn't imagine Obama filling the role of moderate consensus-builder after the way he has performed in the last four years"" - really, this is total insanity. At every step of the way, on every major piece of policy, Obama has aggressively sought compromise. The GOP, recognizing that their lone path out of the wilderness was to deny him passage of anything, has been unprecedentedly unwilling to compromise. And this is somehow evidence of Obama's immoderacy? ""you could easily see Romney in this role."" - only because Democrats aren't so insane as to nearly cause the federal government to default because they don't like the results of elections. Patrick, you live in a fantasy world. I know you probably think I do, but nobody outside the right-wing fringe in the US agrees with you. Vast numbers of people in pretty much every country on the planet look at this election and see a clear choice: the relatively moderate center-right candidate aggressively interested in productive compromise, and the blank-slate partisan symbol of one of the most unserious, unscientifically-interested, theologically-radical, desperately unhinged political movements in all of Western democracy. If the world is as you think it is, what explains why nobody on the planet outside of the Fox News viewership sees it your way?",You know what - the problem is US Politics and with a Black President in Power does not allow for compromise unfortunately but it must be said even in 2012  ... I believe that Mitt has some good ideas that could be applied with tax reform yes I said it ..  but you need a balanced approach the Republicans would rather see the President fail than to compromise for the Country ...  So right now Obama has not choice but to dig in deep ...  You also forget that MITT moved to the center notice moving to center means you move away from your crazy scary right and he has to govern the Country from the center where you need to think things through ... But you also need to compromise ... Obama wants to.  Give this guy 4 more years ...  The US has to get out of thinking in terms of 4 years and start thinking long term like the Chinese 100 years ... I think Obama is on track.,Do you remember when GOP came close to defaulting on government debt?  The adult in the room was Obama.
Calisthenic Switzerland,How do you personally incorporate exercise gear into your fitness routine whenever you travel a lot and don't have access to a gym?,"Hi Paula - perfect question, for perfect timing.

If we are full of power, we can dedicate a day to sprints. The gear we‚Äôll need is a mid-strength rubber band (like a 75lbs resistance, purple in my case), gymnastic gloves, and/or chalk. To train inside the room; this is tricky, because we are limited with pull-ups; in fact, the only think we could do where we are staying it jackknife pull-up with a tower hooked around the door handle‚Ä¶ and bridges - of course, bridges.

Italian Restaurant,"Where are the best Italian restaurants in Brooklyn, NY?","My favorite I've had, and a fairly common answer to this question, is Di Fara in Midwood. Incredibly good old school New York-style pizza, made by a guy who has been making pizza in that spot for 40 years.  It's not cheap and the waits can be ridiculous (go on a weekday afternoon if possible, and even then expect to wait an hour or more) but it's worth it at least once for the experience of seeing Dom work and the awesome pizza. A couple other personal favorites: - L&B Spumoni Gardens in Bensonhurst. Good, cheap square pizza (ignore the round pizza) in an outdoor setting with lots of entertaining people watching. - Toby's Public House in South Park Slope. Fancy (also not-cheap) thin crust pizza with nice toppings. Better when you can eat outside, it's kind of loud and sports-bar-y inside. This is my personal pick of the newer-style upscale pizza places in Brooklyn I've been to but some of that probably has to do with it being a reasonably short walk from my house.

Italian Restaurant,Which US city has the best Italian restaurants?,"Probably none. What is Italian? Most immigration to the US from what is now called Italy occurred before there was an Italy. Most of that was from the South, including Sicily and the area around Naples. Red sauce. This is not the area where you find the best food in Italy today, or then. The best food was and is in the north (Milan, Bologna, Florence) which provided very little immigration to the US. I think it‚Äôs hilarious when ‚ÄúItalians‚Äù from, say, NY-NJ go to Italy to places like Florence and go to restaurants expecting to find food like back home in NYNJ. Of course it simply doesn‚Äôt exist and they are confused. No spaghetti with meatballs? No gabagol? No ‚ÄúSunday gravy‚Äù? Babes in the woods. There are good restaurants in the US serving all types of food that people associate with ‚ÄúItaly.‚Äù There is no way to pinpoint which city has the ‚Äúbest‚Äù ones. There is no way to try them all and decide which is best. Any restaurant can turn out good things and not-so-good things, and any particular preparation can be good one night and bad the next. Restaurants come and go. If one is genuinely interested, then the only thing to do is, when in a specific city, do your research and try something that appears to be good. Unfortunately, that has become more difficult recently due to the proliferation of crowdsourced ‚Äúreviews‚Äù done by amateurs who have no clue what they are tasting or writing about. In those cities which still have respected restaurant columnists in the local newspaper/magazine, who sometimes do know what they are talking about, you have a fighting chance.

Good luck.",https://www.quora.com/Which-US-city-has-the-best-Italian-restaurants,"Sure, but usually the higher the percentage of a certain demographic and the commonness and popularity of certain eateries in an area, the more likely you‚Äôll be to find places that serve good examples of that food. It‚Äôs easy to be seen as good if you‚Äôre one of the few games in town. For example, Mexican food is generally still mediocre here in Massachusetts.

Italian Restaurant,What are some good Italian restaurants in Seattle/Bellevue?,"A recent dinner at Spinasse (Capitol Hill) was easily my single favorite Seattle dining experience.  Although the menu generally consists of traditional dishes (vitello tonnato, for example), there are nods to more modern techniques and ingredients.  Aside from the desserts (good, not great), every single dish I've tried has been excellent. Tavolata (Belltown) is a good place to eat fancy pasta.  The dishes are well-sauced and incorporate both common and obscure styles. For a more casual meal, I like Da Pino (Ravenna).  There's a regular menu with sandwiches, salads, and the like as well as a whiteboard with pasta specials.  Nothing is too complicated, but it's always satisfying. Osteria La Spiga's (Capitol Hill) happy hour menu is worth investigating if you're in the area. Nothing is mind-blowing, but the price is right.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-Italian-restaurants-in-Seattle-Bellevue,+1 Spinasse (Capitol Hill) if you're looking for the real deal and a meal you'll never forget.,"For casual Italian, I love Ristorante Machiavelli at Melrose and Pine on Capitol Hill.",Volterra in Ballard is nice,,
Ichika Nito,"How do music instrument players feel about millionaire ""artists"" who can't play any instruments?","Are you saying that we instrumentalists are superior to singers? That‚Äôs an immense load of shit. Singers can very well be very musical, technical and virtuosic, without having to touch one instrument. They can create melodies and compose music without having to touch one instrument. And unlike us, they can create and perform music without having to touch one instrument. Even if all they can do is sing, and even just satisfactorily, what right do we have as instrumentalists to take away from their success? You‚Äôre the instrumentalist who is supposedly good at your craft, so why aren‚Äôt you a millionaire and a celebrity? Because that someone you call ‚Äúartist‚Äù can sing good enough to at least make easy work of autotune, but they are also do their job as artists of the art of entertainment and celebrity. You on the other hand are an instrumentalist with no skill in the art of entertainment - that is why you‚Äôre not a millionaire. Your scope of audience is pretty much musicians and listeners of musicians. That‚Äôs not really a huge market, so also don‚Äôt wonder why you‚Äôre not making millions from the economic standpoint. But if you‚Äôre also talking about very talented singers? Why would you think so low of them? Ariana Grande for example was an entertainer and actor first before she became a career singer. And as a singer, she is very capable both technically and musically. And then she maintains an image, goes along with trends, engages the audience, and actively gathers more listeners and fans. She deserves those millions. Stop complaining about you being supposedly good with your instrument and not being a rich superstar because of it, because you‚Äôre not doing what it takes to actually be a millionaire. Music alone doesn‚Äôt sell, if you haven‚Äôt figured it out yet. You want to be a millionaire ‚Äúreal artist‚Äù? Sell out. Dance like Leo P and dress in garish suits like Leo P. Harmonically murder a pop song like John Coltrane. Get a bowl cut and wear uniforms like The Beatles. Do gimmicky YouTube videos like Jacob Collier. Play with something so alien and off-genre for your genre like Herbie Hancock. Have equipment that is barely functional but honestly just eye candy like Terry Bozzio and Neil Peart. Dance with your eyebrows like Papa Jo Jones. Start a meme like Adam Neely. Title your compositions with as weird sentences like Ichika Nito. Do a crab walk like Robert Trujillo. Make video game noises like Herman Li. Make self deprecating jokes like Eddy Chen and Brett Yang. All those people are excellent instrumentalists in their own right, but they didn‚Äôt become famous and rich solely on their instrumental talent.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-music-instrument-players-feel-about-millionaire-artists-who-cant-play-any-instruments,,,,,

Pepe the frog,Why are the replies to Donald Trump tweets no longer filled with users with Pepe the Frog avatars / variations on deplorable as their profile names?,"The answer seems to be that Twitter cracked down on these accounts and on automated replying behavior in early December.

Presidential Election,Who actually won the 2000 American presidential election?,"Executive Overview : Even if you fully accept the Electoral College, but you judge the real winner to be the person people got off their duffs to go vote for, then by that criterion, Gore was ‚Äî in a sense ‚Äî the true winner of the 2000 election. However, to avoid a Civil War, the unjust results of 2000 had to be accepted. I think many people have long held that democracy is not merely a matter of reading people‚Äôs minds, but a also a test of who cares enough to drive or get a ride down to the polls and wait in line long enough to vote. In a way it is unfair, because there is often a lack of voting facilities in poor and minority areas, so they have to stand in line much longer than wealthy people. But even with that accepted , Gore is still undoubtedly the ‚Äúreal winner‚Äù in the sense that his voters did get off their butts long enough to go down and vote, and they did it in sufficient numbers to win in Florida and thereby win in the Electoral College. So what the heck happened????? I‚Äôm going to echo Greg Wasserstrom, who mentioned the 20,000 disenfranchised voters. The Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris ‚Äî who was also George W. Bush‚Äôs campaign manager, no bias there!!! ‚Äî had earlier gone ahead with an extreme ‚Äúpurging‚Äù plan to purge the rolls of ex-con voters (not really a problem in Florida, as ex-cons voting happens less than 1 in 100,000 votes) but it was deliberately super-aggressive‚Ä¶ purging names that were vaguely similar to that of felons‚Ä¶ and in the process purging tens of thousands of  legitimate  voters. The illegally purged voters in Florida were overwhelmingly in poor and minority areas and therefore much more likely to be Gore voters. Conservative estimates indicate that Gore amost certainly lost a net 8,000 votes this way, in an election ultimately decided by little over 500 votes. So yes, these are 20,000 people ‚Äî who represent a big surplus for Gore ‚Äî who actually went down to the polls to vote but were illegally turned away. Here is the ultimate stupidity: IF ONLY THOSE VOTERS HAD BEEN GIVEN PROVISIONAL BALLOTS (which is how elections are supposed to be run, to prevent this kind of unfairness), then Gore would‚Äôve won Florida and therefore the majority of the Electoral College (EC) easily. In short, THAT‚ÄôS A STUPID WAY TO ELECT A PRESIDENT‚Ä¶ BECAUSE THERE WAS AN INJUSTICE THAT WAS NOT CORRECTED EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN!!!!!!!! And that‚Äôs just one of the things that went wrong. Consider‚Ä¶ Butterflly Ballot If you look at the 2,000+ ballots thrown out because people voted for both Gore and Buchanan, common sense dictates that it is more or less obvious that these people were trying to vote for Gore, and were afraid that just punching one hole might produce the wrong choice. Buchanan himself said that the vast majority of such people were probably trying to vote for Gore. But let‚Äôs be ‚Äúconservative.‚Äù Let‚Äôs just give Gore only HALF the votes thrown out because of the double-vote (Gore, Buchanan). In that case, Gore wins Florida, and with it, wins the Electoral College majority. Plurality vs Majority In each state, a plurality system rules‚Ä¶ which means you can win a state with just 41% (for example) as long as no other single candidate gets more than 40%. A much fairer system would be to allow an instant run-off in which 3rd party voters could indicate their second choice. Under this system, Nader voters could‚Äôve had their votes redistributed, mostly to Gore, while Buchanan voters could‚Äôve had their votes redistributed, mostly to Bush, during the instant runoff. Then you see who gets the majority among the top two candidates. Under that system, Gore would‚Äôve picked up enough net votes from Nader voters to easily win both Florida and New Hampshire‚Ä¶ and EITHER of those states would‚Äôve given him the Electoral College majority. In no case would ‚Äúmajority‚Äù voting, requiring some kind of runoff, helped Bush. The Nader effect hurt Gore significantly more than the Buchanan effect hurt Bush. So even in Florida alone, it was clear that more people preferred Gore to Bush than Bush to Gore. That is clear. But the Nader effect unfairly helped Bush. In a more rational system, Gore wins‚Ä¶ not just the popular vote, but the Electoral College as well. Electoral College Finally, there is Electoral College (EC) stupidity. The EC in no way functions the way it was originally designed. The 538 electors are not 538 wise people chosen to make a better decision than the public. Instead they REFLECT the popular vote in a knee-jerk fashion, as they are chosen specifically to vote for whom they are pledged. The EC does not, I repeat, function as originally designed. It  is  the so-called ‚Äúpopular vote,‚Äù just in distorted form. All it does it make it possible for someone who got less votes overall to win. It is mathematically stupid. In Summary If EC stupidity were the only reason Bush ‚Äúwon,‚Äù that would be bad enough, but as Gore himself said, we have to accept the rules of the game; we cannot change them retroactively. (The EC ought to be abolished, however, in between elections.) But the disenfranchisement of 20,000 voters who went to the polls to exercise their rights is not within ‚Äúthe rules of the game.‚Äù It was an absolutely obscene outrage and a crime against democracy. I wish that in view of that, the Bush administration had tried to appoint some Democrats to the cabinet and tried to govern from the center. Instead Bush, under the influence of Karl Rove, did the exact opposite. Bush acted as if he had a sweeping mandate and moved as far to the right as he could. Then, even though the Democrats united the country after 9/11, Bush deliberately used the Iraq War as a ‚Äúwedge‚Äù issue to drive Democratic members out of Congress. Eventually, the country saw that the ‚Äúweapons of mass destruction‚Äù could not be found and then turned against Bush and the Republican Party; but before then, a lot of damange had been done.",https://www.quora.com/Who-actually-won-the-2000-American-presidential-election,"I would like to ask something‚Ä¶ I watched to recount on television and both parties had observers during the recount and every disputed ballot was examined by both parties. To impart that Sec. Harris, being Bush‚Äôs campaign manager tilted the recount in favor of Bush is very misleading and simply untrue. In that case, can we say that the Democratic majority on the Florida Supreme Court ordering a recount in counties where there were ‚Äúundervotes‚Äù which happened to be in ‚Äúblue‚Äù counties was biased. Gore lost. This is our Constitutional system that we have lived with since 1787. The populations of the States, voted for their President. Bush won more electors than Gore. Why is this unjust? Because your man lost? Come on!","Instant run off also disenfranchises voters, because ballots that do not include the two ultimate finalists are cast aside to manufacture a faux majority for the winner. Also think about a case with a strong third-party candidate, like Ross Perot in 1992. Suppose 35% of voters prefer Bill Clinton to George H.W. Bush to Perot, 31% prefer Bush to Clinton to Perot, and 34% prefer Perot to Bush to Clinton. If everyone votes sincerely under IRV, Clinton wins after Bush is eliminated in the first round ‚Äì even though 65% of voters prefer Bush to Clinton. But it gets worse. If just a small number of Perot preferrers (>3%) put Bush first and Perot second, then Perot would be eliminated first, and Bush ‚Äì their second choice ‚Äì would win. They‚Äôll have a strategic incentive to falsify their preferences.","‚Äúcommon sense dictates that it is more or less obvious that these people were trying to vote for Gore, and were afraid that just punching one hole might produce the wrong choice.‚Äù You really justify this as common sense?

Presidential Election,Who will win the 2012 U.S. presidential election?,"As someone whose candidate is guaranteed to lose ( Gary Johnson (politician) ) I know I will be disappointed by the results either way.  With that said, the conventional polls seem to consistently anticipating a Democrat turnout at equal level to 2008, and with these projections, predict a slim victory for President Obama.  A number of factors contradict these assumptions, and the assumption that Democrat-leaning independents and moderately Democrat voters are equal in enthusiasm to the 2008 campaign is demonstrably false.  Honest Progressives are tired - tired of being lied to, tired of seeing that every policy they objected to about George W. Bush (War on Drugs, expanding wars overseas, bailouts and shady sweetheart deals for big campaign donors, ZERO Wall Street criminals prosecuted by Obama's DOJ/Eric Holder) and many Obama voters who crossed party lines will be disinclined to do so again.  On the topic of Indepedents: conventional polls split the Independents between Romney and Obama. This is probably inaccurate - for the truly Independent who aren't particularly excited about either candidate, the vote becomes a choice between ""more of the same"" or ""something different.""  Romney's job is to sell himself as a reasonably palpable option to the ""something different"" camp. With his strong performance in the first debate, he accomplished that, and I expect he will grab 60~65% of the Independent voters.  As a political gadfly, I subscribed to all the campaigns' email distribution lists and the tone of each is telling, as they are the purest expression of the campaign sentiments to what they feel is their own base.  General impressions:   Obama campaign emails: Plaintive, desperate, and more focused on how ""extreme"" the opponent is - far more attention is focused on tearing down the opponent than proudly articulating victories. In addition, very aggressively wheedling tone in demanding money.  This is the stance of an incumbent with poor internal polling numbers, trying desperately to shore up their base; from the tone of their campaign messages, they've all but given up on trying to win over Independents.  Romney campaign emails: Bland but confident, focused on accomplishments, future-looking plans and focuses more on Romney than Obama.  Since the October debate, they've gone into overdrive and many local campaign offices in swing states are reporting record numbers of new volunteers showing up to help out Gov Romney; the enthusiasm gap favors Romney.  Indeed, at a rally in Ohio, Obama mentions Romney and was met by a chorus of boos, to which he said ""Don't boo, vote! Voting is the best revenge!""
Revenge, reactive anger, negativity can accomplish only so much, and Obama has fully tapped out all of the resources he can to smear his opponent. Partisan Democrats are happy with those attacks, but Independents who will ultimately decide the race are not so easily swayed.  With all that said, I think it will be a close race, with plenty of nail-biting reports coming in throughout the day that will tilt things one way, then the next and ultimately result in Romney nudging ahead.",https://www.quora.com/Who-will-win-the-2012-U-S-presidential-election,"But if you're a libertarian, you probably see some good in the policies of either candidate, and could at least have one aspect to be happy about, no?

Presidential Election,Do Democrats think they can win the 2020 presidential election?,"Yup. One of the things I find most fascinating about current conservative attitudes is this weird absolute confidence so prevalent in their online rhetoric that a Trump 2020 is a foregone conclusion. In contrast, let me first say that as I've said in the past, Trump is an incumbent President benefiting from a good economy. This normally signals a win. A Trump win in 2020 would not be a surprise. Any Democrat surprised by a Trump 2020 win isn't paying attention. But that doesn't change the fact that any conservative thinking a Trump win is a given is absolutely fooling themselves. Trump likes to pretend that he won 2016 in some sort of ‚ÄúElectoral College Landslide‚Äù The truth is that his victory would be changed by 39k voters. 2016 EC Vote totals were R:304-D:227, a margin of 77, meaning 39 votes change hands, the election flips. Want to know exactly how precarious that is? Trump won Florida by 112,911 votes, securing him that state‚Äôs 29 electors. In 2018, the Florida Governor's race went to the Republican by just 10,033 votes. That was before 1,686,318 former felons who had paid their debt to society regained the right to vote. The demographics in that group do not favor Republicans. The margin is almost certainly enough to flip that state. If nothing else changed, that would not quite flip the election. The Republicans would have 275 votes and the Democrats 256. Time to look at these typically blue states where Trump pulled it out by razor-thin margins. Michigan elected a Democratic Governor in 2018 by almost 7 points. If 5,353 voters from 2016 change hands, Michigan's 16 votes go blue. R: 259 D: 272 You read that right. 90,037 out of 62,984,828 people in the right place who voted for Trump in 2016, change sides, he loses the election. That‚Äôs 0.14% of his vote total. Think that's a lot of votes? The election could have flipped on less. In Pennsylvania, 22,146 votes change their minds and that states 20 EC Votes go blue. Wisconsin flips when 11,374 people in that state decide differently, and another 10 EC votes go blue. The aforementioned Michigan flipped with 5,353 votes changing hands to make the total 258 votes for the Republicans, and 273 for the Democrats. All because 38,873 people changed their minds, all in states that went VERY blue in 2018. Yeah 00.0617% of Trump‚Äôs vote total. Do Democrats think they can win? Do they think a little less than 39k people might change their minds if they're not voting against Hillary Clinton? Yeah. I'd say Democrats think they can win.",https://www.quora.com/Do-Democrats-think-they-can-win-the-2020-presidential-election,"I think when they do this, they are trying to talk themselves into it as much as they are others. Deep down they have to understand it doesn‚Äôt look good.","As a whole, the voting population is also slightly younger than it was 3 years ago.

That should tip the scales a bit further.","Don‚Äôt worry about Florida. Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania hold the keys.The Don has not increased his appeal in any of those 3 states. He is underwater in each of them.","There is also the flip side, which is that people who didn‚Äôt vote for Trump (either stayed home or held their noise and voted Clinton) wouldn‚Äôt do so the second time around. Most of the fears of ‚Äúcraziness‚Äù are at least muted today. He hasn‚Äôt nuked anyone and the economy hasn‚Äôt crashed due to his best efforts at alienating trade partners. So long as he keeps spouting the same conservative talking points, conservatives who couldn‚Äôt bring themselves to vote for him in 2016 could definitely do so in 2020.","Everywhere I go there is a groundswell of YOUNG voter registration. There are a LOT of new voters in the system who are very well informed, and who know they will have 4 more years of drumpf if they dont get ALL their friends out to vote. This is true even way out in the rural counties where the trump popularity myths are most accepted. I can count odds, and I really like the democrat's odds in the coming election cycle, and the probable coattails from all the young voters saying ‚Äúenough"". IMO that means the Senate is also possible, but state demographics matter a lot for that scenario. Im counting on republican senators making fools of themselves in an impeachment trial. I fully expect that they will [try to] impress the rightwing press clients.. and effectively alienate the centrists who were watching them with their silly circus act of fake and overdone oppobrium. IMO, This will motivate the opposition to vote, and to get all their friends to vote, like has never been seen before. The republicans can only hope suburbia shows up for them again, and the men might. The women .. not so sure. But there isnt any new depth or new voter groups hoping for their success. And that is why the democrats odds are so good. Trump helps manufacture and motivate his opposition on a daily basis. He does it loud and proud and if he goes down, you know it will be because the idiot cannot shut up. YOU KNOW THATS TRUE, even the most solid supporters i know will admit that difference and that reality based possibility. A very highly motivated opposition is being ignored by the trump faithful. And I like that, coz I plan to be out ready to photograph their surprise faces the next day. It will be one of the sweetest thangs."

Ichika Nito,Who are some of your favorite modern composers or works (within about the last 40 years) of instrumental music (band or orchestra)? Film scores are alright but I am looking to broaden beyond that.,"Actually, I strongly suggest you listen to minimalist music and respect it, because the specific dogma of minimalism pervades many corners of contemporary composition. I‚Äôd like to elaborate. The idea of minimalism is to 1. Move on from old complexity and 2. Use minimal musical material so as to generate an effect. The idea of #2 is that when hearing similar ‚Äúemotional structures‚Äù in so sparse and simple a format, the musical result is potentially titanic and cathartic. Now, as to what forms of minimalism there are - this is a looser question. When one thinks of minimalism, one thinks of Philip Glass, likely. This is a bad idea. I won‚Äôt judge for you whether or not Philip Glass is a good composer. (Frankly, I‚Äôve only enjoyed  Einstein on the Beach,  which I recommend.) But minimalism is not a movement comprised of a lone composer‚Äôs style of repetition. He is the picture of the movement by chance - in reality, there are so many others that have imagined minimalism in their own way. When you think of abstract-expressionism, you can‚Äôt simply think of Jackson Pollock. You think of the  idea,  of the  structure  of abstract-expressionism. (You also have to think about Rothko and Kooning.) What is the  structure  of minimalism? It certainly isn‚Äôt Philip Glass alone.  For one, it can look like harmonic simplicity. This can take many forms itself - it can use a simple scale and play with solely diatonic harmony, though, careful to avoid cliche it avoids common voicings of chords ( Phyrgian Gates) . It can mean a montage of simple/diatonic chords or ‚Äúareas‚Äù of similar harmonies ( Common Tones in Simple Time) . The orchestration would be kept light and varied often, in order to spice up old chords and introduce new ones. It could mean only a variety of pentatonic scales were used, each in a different key ( Become Ocean) . It may look like melodic simplicity, and lack clear themes or extended lines that provide jarring coherence. A melody is sacrilegious - melodies are too focused; carefully limiting the coherence of a work to a wave of sound is the dogma in minimalism. It may sound something like a melody, however, but due to sparseness and unconventional progressions, it breaks the coherence traditionally associated with melodies and their use (Arvo Part -  Spiegel im Spiegel) . It can look like structural simplicity. It may be repetitive, in terms of repeating self-sustaining motifs and arpeggios that are absurdly simple (Philip Glass -  Violin Concerto ). It may be a drone-like pattern. It may repeat, but be contrasted in a new way over time, slowly evolving harmonically and rhythmically and even conservatively by conveying a plot with its structure ( Hallelujah Junction) . It may weave in and out like a steady ambient wave, intended as a long experience of unending yet slightly varying climaxes (Steve Reich -  the desert music);  gradually the repeated object may vary over time. Often, it may be so absurdly simple that it becomes a meme among college students ( Clapping Music) -  but if one listens to both  Clapping Music  and  the desert music  one will see that the manner of repetition and gradual evolution is alone to Steve Reich, just as the rigid, more ‚Äúsorted‚Äù repetition of Philip Glass‚Äô is alone to him. If you doubt the power of repetition, surely, you haven‚Äôt yet heard Erik Satie -  Vexations  in its glorious entirety!  But surely this isn‚Äôt nearly enough, or nearly thorough enough. And I don‚Äôt want to waste my time either! So let‚Äôs look at the effects of  the dogma of minimalism  in today‚Äôs most common music. For one, the nature of ‚Äúambience‚Äù must be discussed. Obviously, ambience has pervaded all background music that exists today. From the formless Michael Nyman -  Decay Music  to the more music-filled Max Richter -  Sleep,  films and games have quickly caught on to the idea of ‚Äúsomething playing in the background.‚Äù Film soundtracks have been influenced in obvious ways by Glass, and to extension, Hans Zimmer, whom everyone surely recognizes. A great example of the minimalist tendency of his work is found in Interstellar, such as with  No Time for Caution , which at times carefully subverts the idea of a coherent form by constantly varying repetition, yet at others gives into a mainstream method of reaching a tonic chord; regardless, the evolution of this score is tremendous in the film. Horror games use ambience and assortments of creepy sounds in their soundtracks. They are often eerily repetitive or bare, as opposed to melodic and bright - for they would become campy, or genuinely energetic. This is a practical  application  of minimalism - in the use of generating anxiety. We may be reminded, in a close comparison, of the expressionist Krzysztof Penderecki -  Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima.  We may also be reminded of Ligeti -  Artikulation , which is monumental in the way of sound design and of electronic music in general. Of course, neither of these works are traditionally ‚Äúminimalistic‚Äù in a sense that you would recognize; this is true. However, to describe their effect as un-minimalistic is inaccurate in hindsight, considering their influence on future music. Ambience is one application. Ambience was also a major field of interest in the development of electronic music. The Ligeti work I mentioned above was one such example; Stockhausen wrote his  Elektronische Musik.  It wouldn‚Äôt be long until artists recognized the potential of electronic music and its adaptability. The first great ambient album for the mainstream was Richard D James‚Äô  Selected Ambient Works 85‚Äì92.  This is not ‚Äúart‚Äù music, anymore, of course; but listening to its repetitive form, gradual evolutions, and sparse harmonic landscapes should no doubt remind you of a multi-faceted minimalism - one that is considered with the popular style of harmony and voicing as learned by rock/jazz/pop, and the structure and characteristics of minimal work (and the techniques of predecessors of electronic music).  Harmony has also faced a general simplification over time. Music has become less chromatic, and more like jazz harmony - though without the chromatic voicings and progressions. One is reminded of late Sibelius - the ending of Sibelius 7 perhaps. But him and Stanchinsky ( -  5 Preludes in the form of a Canon ) are merely precursors of future tonality and pianistic styles. I‚Äôve already mentioned characters such as John Adams, John  Luther  Adams, Reich, Richter, Part and Nyman. But expand your horizons with me, too: think of John Mackey -  Aurora Awakes;  hear this and  Wine-Dark Sea  as both are brilliant. His harmonies are simplistic, diatonic, and never collected into plain triadic chords - though there is none of the repetition that characterizes earlier minimalist music, the strategies employed with regard to motifs, ‚Äúspaces‚Äù of harmony, and form are similar. Think of Takashi Yoshimatsu -  Pleiades Dances I , which switches between time signatures to provide rhythmic variance among ‚Äúareas‚Äù of similar harmony which are easily obscured against direct labeled specificity due to their free diatonicism and wide interval leaps (which scatter the chords). His symphonies, which combine conservative uses of dissonance with pop styles, minimalist tendencies, and generally eclectic montages are great joys and perfect contemporary examples of symphonies. Generally, there are so many contemporary works for band ensemble that reflect this mode and character of composition that it is exciting. Of course, by now the ‚Äúpurity‚Äù of minimalism has not lasted, and many use melodies and popular/eclectic elements in their compositions. I recommend Patrick Harlin -  Rapture  from the NTWS, one of the best college bands, who play a stunning variety of brilliant new music. We might also talk about rock music; namely math rock. I am not well acquainted to all rock, so I am not an expert on this subject. But I do know that artists such as Covet, Elephant Gym, Floral, and Ichika Nito subvert traditional pop music styles and tropes, while adapting to the diatonicism and simple progressions of minimalist music. Often this music is repetitive, gradually transformative, and akin to strange or rapidly changing time signatures - hence the name ‚Äúmath‚Äù rock. Even when the music does give in to popular styles, math rock is worth listening to nonetheless - if we truly love music, we mustn‚Äôt be elitists! One likes  music,  not  good music. But perhaps the clearest example of minimalism as purely harmony and not repetition is the soundtrack of Nintendo‚Äôs The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, in which a looping, bright piano leaps around the daytime, perfectly representing the clear air of an empty, abandoned landscape, as in  Hyrule Field (Day).  The notes leap, sometimes stumble over, zoom, but most importantly, breath deeply after every musical idea passes. Game soundtracks are filled with examples of great minimalism in application. Minecraft‚Äôs  Calm 1  (and other two  Calm- s) are peaceful, isolating loops of solitary bliss. Yume Nikki‚Äôs entire soundtrack is endowed with pure minimalism; often some of the tracks are mere loops of intervals, or repetitions of two chord progressions, or extensions of sounds such as bells. Minimalism as used in these three examples can imbue a profound sense of loneliness, or emptiness; of course, the same principle is applied in only a slightly different way with meditation music, where it becomes as catharsis.  Ugh, I‚Äôve talked too much about minimalism. I don‚Äôt even like it all that much! But I think such an answer as ‚Äúit‚Äôs boring‚Äù is dismissive and absolutely unfair. I wish you will give a genuine effort to also acquaint yourself with the beauty of simplicity and minimalism. And of course remember, too much of something is a bad thing. I would never suggest for minimalism to be the sole dogma of music at any time or on any project. Good music is willing to adapt, to evolve, to steal from other movements and styles at will. For music recommendations that aren‚Äôt minimalist, or aren‚Äôt in the same vein as the picture of ‚Äúmodern music‚Äù that is easily prescribed, I could recommend a few:  Kapustin - Classical with the character of Jazz, rather than the other way around. He uses classical structures and plots with Jazz harmonies and virtuosic (monstrously adept) pianism, to generate a free and energetic sound. I love the  Piano Sonata No. 1. Jennifer Higdon.  Violin Concerto. Messiaen. Sofia Gubaidulina. John Corigliano. Lowell Liebermann. Carl Vine.  Piano Sonata No. 1 . (Really good.) Kevin Puts. Einojuhani Rautavaara. John Tavener. Toru Takemitsu. Hans Werner Henze. Henryk Gorecki.  Music is better than ever. The sheer proof of that is in the internet: new music is accessible; old music is easily accessible; undiscovered composers new and old are ready at our fingertips. Composers start early and start late - but they  start .

Presidential Election,Why did Reagan defeat Carter in a landslide in the 1980 U.S. presidential election?,"I should like to add two things: First, Carter lost in a landslide, but Reagan did not win in one. The popular vote was Reagan 50.7%-Carter 41.0%-Anderson 6.6%. Reagan barely got a majority of the vote. In the Electoral College, Reagans victory was somewhat magnified. There are five elections in the 20th century where the winner got over 90% of the Electoral College: 1936, 1964, 1972, 1980, and 1984. The other four were bona fide landslides any way you cut it (FDR 60.8-Landon 36.5, LBJ 61.1-Goldwater 38.5, Nixon 60.7-McGovern 37.5, Reagan 58.8-Mondale 40.6). In 1980, Reagan got a disproportionate amount of the breaks in the close states. Reagan won all three states decided by less than 1% (Massachusetts, Tennessee, and Arkansas), four of the five states decided by between 1% and 2% (Alabama, Mississippi, Kentucky, and South Carolina; Carter won Hawaii), and three of four states decided by between 2% and 3% (North Carolina, Delaware, and the electoral giant of New York; Carter won Maryland). If say Carter had won one more state out of each category (say, Tennessee, South Carolina, and North Carolina), he would have gotten 82 electoral votes, which is still a decisive defeat but hanging with the likes of Stevenson in 52 or Willkie in 40 (and non-trivially ahead of the other repudiated one term President whose defeat paved the way for a major Reconstructive presidency in the 20th century, Hoover in 32). If we gave Carter the  largest  state out of each category--Massachusetts, either Alabama or Kentucky, and New York--he would have been at 113--over 100 (Bush Sr. was hoping to stay above 100 in 1992 because that would not be a complete ‚Äúblowout"") and one better than Dukakis. I think that would have reflected the reality of the situation better. Even taking the Reagan-Carter margin of 9.7% (and ignoring whether Reagan got a majority or if so by how much), that is more comparable to the 8.5% margin in 1996, which, I'm not sure if the typical view of it is that it was a ‚Äúlandslide"" exactly, but it was certainly in a different category to the likes of 1928, 1932, 1936, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1972, and 1984. (In fact, margin-wise, Reagan beat Carter by less than FDR beat Willkie in 40 [9.97%].) (Incidentally, the breaks did not favour the winner so heavily in any other comparable election. In 1932, Hoover won two of three states decided by between 1% and 2%, and he and FDR split the two states decided by between 2% and 3% evenly. Admittedly, Hoover lost the biggest ones in each case, and the biggest ones were quite big indeed, but even if we give him every close state [which we did not do for Carter], he is at 101, barely over 100. In 1936, there was only one state where the margin was under 3%, New Hampshire; had it tilted Landon's way he would have been at 12. In 1964, Goldwater won the one state decided by less than 1%--Arizona--although Johnson won the other two states decided by less than 3%--Idaho and Florida [Florida had only 14 back then]. In 1972, there was no state where the margin was even under 5%. And in 1984, Mondale won the one state decided by less than 1%, Minnesota, and he and Reagan split the states decided by less than 3% evenly [the other being Massachusetts].) Furthermore, in the 1982 midterms, the Republicans lost 26 seats. That doesnt sound like a lot today but it was substantially more than any other midterm loss for a first-term President since 1946. (Ike lost 18 in 54, JFK, 4 in 62, Nixon, 12 in 70, and Carter, 15 in 78.) Massive losses in the House became the norm (again--they had been earlier in the 20th century) with the Republican Revolution of 1994. Secondly, the GOP was the normal majority party at the presidential level from 1952 to 1988. If you listen to NBC's election night coverage of the 1992 election, you'll hear several references to the significance of the fact that the Soviet Union had disappeared, as a reason for the apparent result. The only other Democrat to win in this period as a anti-incumbent, Kennedy, did so amid a temporary loss of faith in the GOP's ability to handle the Cold War (Sputnik enabled Kennedy to use the non-existent ‚Äúmissile gap"" as an issue), and postured as himself a hardline Cold Warrior convincingly (in the debates he got to Nixon's right on Cuba). Carter actually  was  a Cold Warrior, having launched Operation Cyclone in Afghanistan (which Reagan would expand), but he didnt come across as one. His win reflected a loss of trust in government following Watergate, but the things that had helped him win in 76--his honesty and earnestness--had hurt him by 80. He told the American people he would not lie to them, which they liked in election season but didnt so much after the malaise speech. Also, the role of TV debates is interesting. It is widely said that people who listened to the first debate in 1960 on the radio thought Nixon won (although I've also heard that that is an urban legend that is not true). In any case, in 1980, before the sole Carter-Reagan debate, Carter narrowly led: After trailing Carter by 8 points among registered voters (and by 3 points among likely voters) right before their debate, Reagan moved into a 3-point lead among likely voters immediately afterward. United States presidential election, 1980 - Wikipedia That was the debate with the famous line. ‚ÄúThere you go again.‚Äù If that can effectively defuse one candidates critique of another's record, I dont really know what to say. It is worth noting that  both Carter and Reagan were perceived negatively by a majority of the electorate . So to the extent Reagan won decisively, it wasn't necessarily an endorsement of him so much as a repudiation of Carter and a desire for change (in general--not necessarily Reagans change, but he was the other guy on the ballot).",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Reagan-defeat-Carter-in-a-landslide-in-the-1980-U-S-presidential-election,Good answer,,,,
Presidential Election,How will Barack Obama's support for gay marriage affect the 2012 Presidential election?,"If the election were in the next few months, it would hurt him.  But, now is the right time.  I don't believe it will have much effect.   Let's discuss the facts:
 Set the bullshit aside --we all knew he was for ""same sex marriage"".  If you doubt this then, just skip my answer now and move on to somewhere else.
 The ""fringe right"" have already labeled Obama as a ""fag lover"".  They already hate him with every fiber of their being.  They've already called for his impeachment, his assassination.  They've already labeled him the Anti-Christ.  They are already mobilized with all their energy to defeat him this fall. The only people who this would motivate are the people who are too stupid to have already known this fact who would otherwise be shocked by the revelation.  By November, this will be old hat. Set the bullshit aside --Romney doesn't really care either.  The fringe right already suspect it and are very worried about it, despite his blatant lies to re-assure him.  He's been busy courting the right-wing of the party and the Dems have been busy painting him as some weird fringe conservative (believe me, I am on the side of Democrats who do this).  But, socially, he's not a fringe ideologue.  He's pretty progressive as Republicans go and--frankly--he's going to run to the middle in T-60 days and will want--desperately--to distance himself from the haters on the right.
 The mainstream Republicans don't want to touch this issue too much either.  The conservatives in the USA have been on the wrong side of history on Race, Sex and now Sexuality.  They know this.   Don't fool yourself:   Gay marriage is coming .  The fringe right can bitch, can talk about ""Jesus coming back"", can presage the end of America (they've been doing it for two-thousand years, why stop now?), but 25 years from now the USA will have gay marriage.  The only question is:   What date, exactly ?  And--of course--the serpent handlers on the right will fight their usual losing battle (like they did against ending slavery, like they did against women's suffrage, like they did against desegregation, like they did against gays in the military).    They will lose.   Conservatives always lose on social issues.  History is on our side.
 This November will come down to the economy for most voters, since most voters either don't care too much about the issue or are actually focused on things that matter.  This--of course--ignores the 54% of Americans who are pro-gay marriage.
 For the fringe right, it will come down to ""that foreign-born-non-real-citizen, nigger, faggot lover in the White House"" and ""taking back America!""  (From whom?  I wonder, considering America put him there, but I guess their desires and votes aren't really American).  The amount of racism, sexism and homophobia in the past four years would boggle the mind of someone in the early 70's, never mind 2012.  We have Republicans on Fox News wishing that women had never been granted the right to vote--nearly a century after women won that right.  We have Republicans hating on every gay person in the USA and refusing to stand against gay bullying.  We have Republicans wanting to strip women of their reproductive and health rights.  It's been a pretty painful past 3.5 years for the far right.  In one election you got a ""foreign born,  mooslim , colored, fag-loving, commie, leftist"" in the White House.  In one fell-swoop, 200+ years of white men ruling the country was ended and that was just too painful for them.  They feel humiliated--what, with women voting, controlling their wombs and who can stick stuff into them; all the gays in the military.  It's just been too much.
 For the fringe left, who've done a fraction of the harm the fringe right has--Obama already has their vote.

Presidential Election,Would American Christians vote for Jesus in a presidential election?,"I agree with the answers that Jesus wouldn't run for office. But, let's put that aside. Are we assuming that Jesus was known to be Jesus? In which case, yes, the vast majority of American Christians would vote for him, there's no one a Christian would trust more to be wise and moral. Are we saying that he claims to be Jesus, but doesn't prove it? In that case, I have to suspect that a lot of people wouldn't believe, and would write him off as a mental case. But the crux of the matter, to me, is if Jesus was running, with his own doctrines and personality, but incognito (as Joshua Josephson, we'll assume). It's not as simple as it might seem. Both Democrats and Republicans have tried very hard to enlist Jesus into their arguments, but there's no clear political message. Jesus never said much about government, except to say that we should submit to governmental authority, with no reference to whether the government is righteous or popular. That would cost him a lot of votes with the most serious politicos, both on the left and the right. As for the issues that people want politicians to speak to? Jesus said ""render unto Caesar"", but he never said whether taxes should be higher or lower, never addressed defense spending or public education. He never talked about international relations or the national debt. Even the issues that tend to be linked to Christianity, he never addressed. He never said a word about abortion. He never addressed gay marriage (as a first century Jew, we can assume he was against it, but he never specified). He encouraged his followers to give to the poor, feed the hungry and clothe the naked, but he never advocated for a system of public welfare. In short, people wouldn't vote for him because he had no political platform on which to run.  In addition, people vote for candidates who are visible. That means they need to fundraise, advertise, and smack down their opponents and much as possible. I can't really see Jesus doing any of those things, so his name would never get out there, and he'd lose in landslide.",https://www.quora.com/Would-American-Christians-vote-for-Jesus-in-a-presidential-election,,,,,

Fashion 2022,Which of the 2022 regulation changes in Formula 1 will have the biggest impacts?,"As I said back in July, the current rule book gets thrown out and a whole lot of new regulations come into effect from 2022 onwards. Basically everything is changing, from the power units through to the size of the tyres. But the most dramatic change is F1‚Äôs efforts to reduce the turbulence which the current cars create in their wake:  All of that turbulence means passing becomes a problem as any car trying to pass a car in front has to deal with it. Consequentially the car behind becomes unsettled and, given F1 cars require good airflow for the essential downforce to keep them from flying off the track, as a result the car behind can‚Äôt push the advantage to pass. As a result the 2022 cars will look different. How different? Well that‚Äôs a good question, but the changes will include winglets around/over the front wheels. Also the rear spoiler will look drastically different and sit lower than currently. The front wing will be of a simpler design, also with winglets, and the nose will change as well. Another feature will include good old fashioned side skirts seen here on the Williams:  Now they‚Äôll be a very different design, than just having part of the car drag along the road like they used to, but again it is part of F1‚Äôs attempt to reduce the turbulence, because with the changes with the wings, spoilers, diffusers, and so forth, they‚Äôre going to be losing a fair amount of downforce. So apart from regaining some grip through mechanical efforts, whether it be via the new 18 inch wheels &/or suspension components, the car will be allowed ground effect technology as well. So that‚Äôs basically it. Slight changes to the power units and elsewhere, but massive changes come the aerodynamics and anything associated therewith.",https://www.quora.com/Which-of-the-2022-regulation-changes-in-Formula-1-will-have-the-biggest-impacts,,,,,

 __COUNTER__: This macro expands to sequential integral values starting from 0. In conjunction with the ## operator, this provides a convenient means to generate unique identifiers.

 7.1.4 Use of library functions
Any function declared in a header may be additionally implemented as a function-like macro deÔ¨Åned in the header, so if a library function is declared explicitly when its header is included, one of the techniques shown below can be used to ensure the declaration is not affected by such a macro.

Ibanez Series S,Describe the sound difference between mini humbuckers and p-90s in a les paul style guitar?,"To be honest with you. I‚Äôm really not sure. As I don‚Äôt play Gibson. I prefer Ibanez. Nothing against Gibson mind you (the sound of rock is a Gibson plugged into a Marshall) I just prefer to play Ibanez because I got a Ibanez S series back in the 90‚Äôs and fell in love with it. It is sleek, lightweight, has killer tone, whammy bar and a thin neck!! All perfect for my style of playing. But you can‚Äôt go wrong with a Les Paul!! If that‚Äôs your preference, excellent choice!! I have heard of the P-90‚Äôs and have been told they are killer!! But wouldn‚Äôt really know how they differ from mini humbuckers? I believe it has to do with the windings. If you want to know how pickups are made you should check it out on youtube  How to Make a Pickup Part 1  Very interesting process. Not only do the windings of the pickup make a difference, but all the other components of the guitar itself contribute to its tone. The pick ups, bridge, wood (of course) tuning keys & even the paint job. So although I couldn‚Äôt directly answer your question, I hope you got something out of my answer.

Pepe the frog,"Where did Pepe the Frog come from, and how is it bad?","It‚Äôs not bad. Well, I suppose it‚Äôs bad if you‚Äôre Hillary Clinton and you have attacked a green cartoon frog named Pepe as a symbol of White Supremacy. Then it‚Äôs bad because, well, you would be wrong. So how did Pepe emerge out of space-time to become an alt-right sensation and is the alt-right racist? Well, you‚Äôve come to the right place because I had excellent seats for this remarkable bit of American history as it unfolded. I am proudly-ALT RIGHT, but definitely NOT NAZI, not racist, not anti-immigrant, and definitely into peace and love. How could that be? I bet you thought we were all racists! Well, if you had listened to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs famous ALT-RIGHT speech in Reno, Nevada, that‚Äôs what you would probably believe. And you might also be inclined to believe that when Trump complained of the dirty varmints in Baltimore he was not actually referring to actual rats but to brown-skinned people because that‚Äôs what Hillary implied. In just the past week, under the guise of ‚Äúoutreach‚Äù to African Americans, Trump has stood up in front of largely white audiences and  described black communities in insulting and ignorant terms: ‚ÄúPoverty. Rejection. Horrible education. No housing. No homes. No ownership. Crime at levels nobody has seen‚Ä¶ Right now, you walk down the street, you get shot.‚Äù Those are his words. Donald Trump misses so much. He doesn‚Äôt see the success of black leaders in every field‚Ä¶ Sorry, Hillary, but this is Donald Trump‚Äôs description of a neglected, rejected, poverty-ridden area that has not seen improvement under successive Democrat leaders. When facing lack of proof for her claims she was at least creative enough to make them up out of thin air. But she lost credibility and that is why Pepe the frog is ultimately bad in the eyes the left and why everyone associated with Pepe must be an evil Nazi. I had an amazing photography teacher in college named Frederick Baldwin who looks like Doc of the Back to the Future series. He taught me to see all nuances and shades of color and light and inspired me to help he and his photographer wife Wendy Watriss produce Fotofest where I contributed my framing and photography skills. So what does it mean for me to be ALT RIGHT? Isn't that something skinheads and neoNazi's are into? No. the movement began when anonymous users of a message board called 4chan became fascinated by the number synchronicities of their posts - the only identifier on the site is a number associated with each post. At the time, occurrences of repeating digits were given mysterious significance and the most auspicious of these is the repeated number 7. An obscure cartoon by Matt Furie became associated with the hunt for 'dubs', that is double, or repeated digits within the anonymous posts. Matt's cartoon of a chill frog named PEPE resonated with the group precisely because it was racially androgynous. It was most definitely NOT a symbol of hate but a symbol of resistance to being typecast and pigeonholed as such. Indeed it was Hillary Clinton's speech in Reno which demonstrated just how ALL-wrong a person could be to attack a green frog because someone decided to put him in a Nazi outfit. Nobody ever accused Mickey Mouse of being Nazi and certainly not Charlie Chaplin even though both were depicted as the Nazi leader in parody. Pepe was given a booster shot when someone discovered a green frog holding a magic wand at the end of a spiral in the artwork of an obscure Italian disco song called Shadilay by the band P.E.P.E. The acronym stands for Point Emerging Probably Entering. Also on the label is printed 007 - the alt right's most revered number. Indeed, a meeting of two sevens stands as one of the movement's most iconic images. The song quickly was adopted by the alt right based on the song‚Äôs refreshing optimism in a dank world. The movement was propelled by a model of space-time called 935-OKK. It is an extraordinarily intuitive modeling of the Arrow of Time. It possesses a fundamentally regenerative property, an emergence of mathematical eggs, or ‚Äòpoint(s) emerging probably entering.' Physically it describes the topology of space-time as an intersection of ever-expanding and orbital paths. Finally, the synchronicities of KEK inspired the push for Justice in the death of Otto Warmbier who single-handedly negotiated a press conference in order to plea for help which sadly never came. However, a Chinese journalist showed up wearing what can understandably be mistaken for a green frog costume and he made a prodigious attempt to seat himself as close to Warmbier as officials would allow. To the alt-right the missed signs and missteps were typical of a political ideology which is unfairly hostile to their benevolent aims. Otto Warmbier through his false and forced confession has become a symbol of the suffering we in the alt-right go through for being typecast and taken for something we are not.

Presidential Election,Will Marine Le Pen win the 2017 French presidential election?,"France is in a disastrous financial situation. If the next President is not able to take strong measures to reform the State‚Äôs growing public debt, liberate private enterprises from excessive taxation ‚Ä¶it runs the risk of becoming a basket case, like Greece. The country has an ever growing debt due to excessive deficit financing of its generous social security protective measures. (See my Quora answer to ‚ÄúWhy France hates capitalism‚Äù)  In a completely surprising first round of the right wing‚Äôs preliminary ballot Fran√ßois Fillon has overwhelmingly beaten his two major competitors. Fillon won with 44 % of the votes, Jupp√© got 29 % and Sarkozy 21 %. Apparently Fillon has an excellent chance of becoming the representative of the right wing parties in the 2017 Presidential election ‚Äì and the present majority led by Fran√ßois Hollande is so unpopular, that he is expected to triumph. However in this post Brexit, post Trump world, where surveys were consistently wrong, nothing is certain until the last ballot is counted ! WHO ARE HIS MOST DANGEROUS OPPONENTS ? One thinks of Marine Le Pen who has systematically tried to distance herself from her highly controversial father and also from the old anti-Semitic Front National party. She has a strong position in the unemployment suffering North of the country, and also in the North African immigrant hating South. Her message sometimes confuses law abiding Arab minorities and the terrorist threat, but she benefits from a wide feeling that the country should move closer to its historical roots.  Fran√ßois Fillon has dedicated a book concerning the fight against Moslem terrorism, so he is less vulnerable than Alain Jupp√©, on this subject. (Jupp√© proposes a happy relationship with Moslems, with whom France should learn to live together, without questioning their values). However one might imagine that if there should be a major terror event like France and Belgium has experienced in the recent past, the time might be ripe for Marine Le Pen‚Äôs message of questioning all legal and international impedimenta in the fight against extremist Moslems. There is however an outsider one should not ignore and who may present his candidacy for the next election : EMMANUEL MACRON . International media are not yet as familiar with him as with Marine LePen, and his positioning of neither right nor left is very unorthodox. The man belongs to no political party and conventional wisdom would consider that he has absolutely no chance of getting elected. He has never held an electoral office, not even as Counsellor for his town ! How can he possibly be taken seriously as a contender for the highest office ?  He is head of a movement (not a party) called ‚ÄúEN MARCHE‚Äù (get going !) Does that remind you of someone who said to a paralyzed man : ‚ÄúGet up and walk‚Äù ! (Bible, John 5:8). Macron‚Äôs approach is just as realistic‚Ä¶but considering his curriculum vitae it might even work. At 16 he won a nation-wide competition of French literature (Concours G√©n√©ral) and also rated third best in a prestigious piano competition. At the age of 21 he was interested in philosophy, became assistant to a famous philosopher and wrote about Machiavel and Hegel. He then entered and graduated at the top of his class at the most prestigious School of Public Administration,(ENA) and worked for 4 years for the Finance Ministry. Thereafter he spent two years with the Rothschild Bank, negotiating one of its major acquisition deals‚Ä¶and left as a full partner and a millionaire. Next step : President Hollande named him as personal assistant and two years later he became Finance Minister. However his two year tenure in this position was not quite a happy one : his various projects for modernising the French economy were severely curtailed by political considerations.(He did manage to authorize some businesses to open on Sunday). He realized that to carry out all his ideas about modernizing France, he needed to be elected President and that is exactly what he is campaigning to become ! If Donald Trump could switch from real estate promotion to the highest office of the United States, Emmanuel Macron would be infinitely better qualified. He wants to federate both right wing and left wing sensibilities for the common pursuit of France‚Äôs reforms ‚Ä¶an approach that is not unusual in coalition-prone countries but that has never been tried in France. May be the times are ripe for unorthodox approaches ! FILLON‚ÄôS PROGRAM Stop deficit financing and over 5 years reduce public debt by 100 billion euros Increase the working week for both public and private employees to 39 hours per week (in stead of 35) Abolish the wealth tax. All retirement pensions are due at age 65. Simplify farm production rules. Create 16.000 additional places in jai, so that all sentences can be carried out Limit immigration Limit unemployment benefits. Abolish all ‚Äúmake work‚Äù false jobs and substantially reduce public employment Once elected edict presidential orders to take the reforming measures and ask the country by referendum to back them up. On past experience, much less ambitious programs were prevented by massive strikes and manifestations. Fillon‚Äôs first round score authorizes the hope that this time the country is ripe for strong medicine‚Ä¶but the proof of the pudding is in the eating !",https://www.quora.com/Will-Marine-Le-Pen-win-the-2017-French-presidential-election,,,,,
Italian Restaurant,What is a good (or great) Italian restaurant in Berlin?,"I very much like ""Trattoria Libau"". As the name suggests it's in Libauer Strasse"" in Friedrichshain. Not too big (about 30-40 seats, I'd guess), run by Italians, usually a fair percentage of the guests is speaking Italian as well.
They offer really well-made pizza with a large variety of toppings and two or three pasta dishes on the regular menu, as well as salads and a few simple starters.
These alone would be reason enough to keep going back, but there's always a small, varying choice of other dishes, which range from fairly good to sensational. Pizza is very affordable (approximately from five to twelve Euro for Very generous portions), pasta a little less so, but very much worth it's price. Everything else is priced like real restaurant fare (which it is) and often included stuff you're not likely to see on most menus in that price range, like pigeon, rabbit or less-common seafood. All in all, it's one of the most authentic Italian places i've come across in Germany, which explicitly excludes high-end restaurants. very well worth a visit, especially since you can always fall back on a fairly cheap and very good pizza if all else fails. Oh: Brick oven, obviously, Pasta is either made in-house or bought from a very good source.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-or-great-Italian-restaurant-in-Berlin,,,,,
Italian Restaurant,Why don't most Italian restaurants serve breakfast?,"Because there is no such thing known as breakfast. Whilst living in Italy what you would call breakfastat at home was a cup of coffee and (maybe a brioche) or caffelatte with pieces of stale brad in it( or dunked). Most people would call breakfast an espresso or a cappuccino at their local bar before heading for work. There is no cultural meaning to Breakfast in Italy, colazione, the correct translation for breakfast means : Breakfast is an important meal and it has to be my favourite meal of the day. This is a typical Italian breakfast that locals would have more on chilled mornings. I consider it to be an all rounded breakfast as it contains both savoury and sweet things. Definitely my kind of breakfast. Ciao a tutti! Welcome back to another post. Today I'm writing a different style of post to my usual recipes but I really wanted to share this scrumptiousness with you all. It‚Äôs been over a year since I‚Äôve last been to Italy. This beautiful country will always have a special place in my heart as it was my first solo adventure (when I studied in Perugia). Since then, I‚Äôve spent a lot of time on this beautiful peninsula. For the past 13 years, I've been to a few different Italian cities but there's still a lot to visit. Its culture is so rich and having studied about Italy for so long, I get really excited about discovering all these cities. Nevertheless, the thing that gets me really excited every time I visit is the food. If you‚Äôre a foodie like me, you've probably heard about and tasted some of the most amazing dishes Italy has to offer. Personally, the meal I look forward to the most is always breakfast. I struggle to have a proper breakfast during the week when I'm rushing from one place to the other or trying to write blog posts and creating recipes. Therefore, I try to make it my mission to at least enjoy and indulge on breakfast during weekends. Since I live in the UK and some Italian products are not as easy to find, I made sure to order a few things I've been craving since I last was in Italy and put together this beautiful tasty breakfast.  What do you serve? coffee milk orange/fruit juice dunking bisquits tartletw crispbreads honwy fruit comfit fresh fruir What do we need? coffee milk orange/fruit juice biscuits - macine, pastefrolle chocolate/apricot tart toasted bread honey fruit jam fresh fruit Why am I obsessed with the Italian breakfast? During my travels I‚Äôve tasted a number of different breakfasts, some sweet based, others more savoury. However, the one I keep craving the most is the Italian breakfast because, in my opinion, it's well balanced. Also, the idea of being in Italy and going to a bar (in Italy a cafe is called a bar) and order breakfast makes me really happy. The smell of freshly brewed coffee and its taste is to die for. I highly suggest you try going to a bar for breakfast if you ever find yourself in Italy. In addition to having a lovely breakfast, being at a bar makes me feel part of a community. The chaotic and fast paced life seems to calm down for a few minutes whilst in a bar enjoying a breakfast. What does the Italian breakfast consist of? During weekdays, at the bar, most people order a cappuccino or an espresso and a pastry. However, if you get the time to have a proper breakfast, then you can also order fette biscottate, cornetti e crostate di marmellata. As I‚Äôve been dreaming of having this breakfast again for a long time, I decided to create the full breakfast. For me, the most important part of my breakfast is having freshly brewed coffee. I decided to go for a caff√® latte. I made an espresso with my Moka and then heated and frothed some milk.    I managed to get  fette biscottate;  twice cooked slices of bread. The idea for the  fette biscottate  is eliminating the too much waste of fresh bread. Most Italians have them with a spread of jam on top. For my breakfast, I decided to get one of my favourite jams; blackcurrant. You could use your favourite jam flavour. Next come the  biscotti  (Italian biscuits). These biscuits are called  biscotti da inzuppo  as most people dip them in their coffee or warm milk. I can honestly say they are some of the nicest biscuits I've ever tasted and they are perfect to dunk in hot drinks. They absorb the milk and become really soft but don‚Äôt fall apart. There are only a few simple ingredients in them such as flour, eggs, milk and sugar. For today's breakfast, I decided to get two of my favourites;  pastefrolle  and  macine  but there are loads more to choose from. It's definitely a blessing I can't get hold of these biscuits in my local supermarket otherwise I would never stop eating these biscuits.   Another classic piece for an Italian breakfast is the  crostatatine . These are simple sweet tarts with a jam or chocolate spread filling and stripes of dough on top. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt get hold of my favourite one;  crostata all‚Äôalbicocca , however, I managed to get the second best, the ones filled with chocolate. These tarts are simple to make at home too. In fact, I decided to make my favourite one, the   crostata all'albicocca  a few days later. Last but not least is fresh fruit. These bring colour to the table and are also an important part of our diet. Italians, like many other countries, try to have some fruit every morning with their breakfast. I went for different coloured fruit such as strawberries, blackberries, pomegranates, mango, kiwi and grapes. Drizzle some honey on top and job done.   Planning and recreating this amazing breakfast has been so much fun and it definitely didn't disappoint. It brought a sense of calmness and that's something I always look forward to having on weekends. Make sure to try this breakfast and stop to chill for a few minutes and enjoy the goodness. Comment down below if this is your kind of breakfast and which other breakfasts I should try. Enjoy! x",https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-most-Italian-restaurants-serve-breakfast,"Okay. So, you‚Äôve done a pretty good job of describing an Italian breakfast. So, the question was, why don‚Äôt Italian restaurants serve it?",,,,
Tricking,What are some mind tricks?,"I know a simple trick related to body language which tricks someones mind into revealing their inner thoughts and gives the performer of the trick (i.e you) good feedback about the way a conversation is going.  Imagine you are in a situation where you are getting to know someone whom you would be happy to please for example -  an interview, networking event, first date etc.  Psychology says that when we like someone we tend to imitate their actions during conversation. This is so subconscious that even people who know this will involuntarily imitate people.  What does that mean ? For eg. You are on your first date and you are having a normal conversation. Of course at times its obvious if its going well or not, but if you are in doubt, try a simple action like... in the middle of a long sentence or anecdote that you are sharing... pause and drink some water, or scratch your nose. If the person opposite does the same ( yes it happens !)  you know you are on the right track.   What actions work : Mostly anything that is distinct enough to be observed as imitated .. touching your face, drinking water, adjusting your glasses, stroking your hair, scratching your head as if thinking, just improvise.

Fashion 2022,"Why is ""#YGLetLisaDoHerWork"" trending on the internet among K-pop fans?","Well, it‚Äôs because a statement was recently released that broke the last straw of many BLINKS and LILIES‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..  As you know, Jisoo, Ros√© and recently, Jennie attended the Paris Fashion Week Spring 2022, representing their own luxury brands as global ambassadors and fans were really excited for Lisa‚Äôs appearance for the upcoming BVLGARI showcase, since she‚Äôs also the global ambassador for BVLGARI and Celine, but BLINKS and LILIES woke up to a news statement from the BVLGARI CEO, according to YG, due the COVID, Lisa won‚Äôt be attending Paris Fashion Week and will miss out on an exclusive photoshoot along with the other muses, such as Zendaya, Lily Aldridge, and Vittoria Ceretti for its Brand Campaign 2021/2022‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..!!  BLINKS and LILIES immediately got mad because during her fan sign, Lisa confirmed she is FULLY VACCINATED and will be on her way to France, so there‚Äôs actually no excuse to why YG won‚Äôt let her attend Paris Fashion Week!! So BLINKS and LILIES started the new trend now #YGLetLisaDoHerWork, which seems to be working since YG‚Äôs stock instantly dropped drastically!!  And also the fact that she already made her solo debut over a month ago and still don‚Äôt have her own personal playlist!!  Before this, YG Entertainment were also very unprofessional with the brands Lisa is endorsing such as‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ VIVO released a statement that says YG is always late in submitting the photos of Lisa so they launched the new phone without her because they already set up the time of release NYLON China Magazine has asked YG to shoot Lisa for their magazine for 6 months and still no reply AIS claimed that YG won‚Äôt let Lisa perform or interact with anyone and also restricted her from going out until AIS had to set up another solo shoot for Lisa Youth With You said that Lisa seems to always have slow connection which is odd since Lisa is a global star and comes from a huge company and that this should be the least of their problems and they feel like they‚Äôre being disregarded DOWNY wants to work with Lisa but they don‚Äôt want to follow the YG‚Äôs work ethics BAZAAR Thailand Magazine claimed they couldn‚Äôt properly have their own creativity because of the restrictions set by YG A lot of magazines and brands are asking to work with Lisa but YG is refusing ALL of them And now BVLGARI is also facing this problem so now she can‚Äôt be included in BVLGARI Global Campaign 2021‚Äì2022 despite being their global ambassador!!  (YG is lucky that BVLGARI in the end decided to not drop Lisa since they still have a good relationship so they decided to continue work with Lisa)  As you can see, right now, Lisa is so high in demand for so many opportunities, brands and ads and YG Entertainment is limiting her opportunities‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. As a BLINK myself, I am also mad over this since Lisa practically not allowed to do anything and YG is treating her like an ATM ever since the change of CEO‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I myself also want ‚ÄúPapa YG‚Äù to come back, despite his past mistakes, he is the one who treated BLACKPINK equally and like the queen they are!! But I need to clarify something, I know BLINKS and LILIES are mad over this but PLEASE don‚Äôt hate on the other members, if you really think about it, they can‚Äôt do anything about it, you might ask ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they like sister?? Why aren‚Äôt the members standing up for Lisa??‚Äù, it‚Äôs because if they do, they‚Äôll also be risking their own careers just to try and save Lisa because the true villain here is their own company‚Ä¶. So please don‚Äôt hate on the other members, as an OT4 stan, I‚Äôm begging you LILIES‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This new CEO isn‚Äôt treating our global stars the way that they deserve!!  After all that, even big sites like MTV is speaking up for Lisa and asking YG to treat her better!!   So what do you think?

Fashion 2022,Should Trump run for a House seat in Florida so he can become Speaker in 2022 and try to impeach Biden?,"Here‚Äôs the absurdity of it all: First off, Donald Trump would need to stand  against an existing Republican representative , unless one plans on surrendering their seat. That seems rather unlikely, and it‚Äôs not going to go down well among Republicans in Florida. Were Trump to successfully be elected to the House of Representatives (which seems unlikely - would he want to run for a lower office?), at present, the Democrats control a majority of seats in the House, so the role of Speaker is for the Democrats to control. He wouldn‚Äôt have a shot at the seat  unless  the Republicans won the majority in 2022. Should the Republicans claim the majority,  Trump would still have to run for Speaker , and it‚Äôs unlikely he‚Äôd win. Remember: we all know that he‚Äôs ultimately incompetent, and is more of a demagogue than a governor or an administrator. The Speaker has a lot of  Congressional responsibilities , and Trump would not be able to cope with those effectively, and certainly not in a civil fashion. More to the point,  becoming Speaker would mean that Trump has to supplant many more-experienced Republicans for the slot . Kevin McCarthy most certainly wants the job, and he‚Äôs likely to resent Donald Trump trying to use it as a springboard to get to the Presidency. I daresay there are many younger Congressional Republicans who are similarly ambitious to get towards the Speakership, and they‚Äôll similarly resent Trump trying to jump the queue, particularly without putting in the work to make himself a competent and reasonable choice. From there, both President Biden and Vice President Harris would need to be impeached and convicted. As Trump ought to know from experience,  this is incredibly difficult to do , particularly since neither Biden nor Harris have done anything that rises to the level of ‚Äúhigh crimes or misdemeanours‚Äù, whatever the Republicans might claim. The fact that you‚Äôd have to remove  both  from office (and simultaneously, too) in order to punt the Presidency to the Speaker of the House makes it particularly unlikely. Not that this is  actually  Donald Trump‚Äôs plan, we should be clear. That deluded moron is  still   expecting that he‚Äôll be returned to the Presidency by force . There‚Äôs no other means by which he could be in the White House by August (which is only two months away):  the only means by which this could be accomplished is by violent overthrow of the US Government by his supporters , and that‚Äôs just not going to happen.

Those charges are State IncomeTax Fraud, Real Estate Fraud, Inheritance Fraud, and Charity Fraud. I think the State Income Tax Fraud and Charity Fraud are the most likely charges that the State Prosecutors will win a convictions on. Tak Charity Fraud as an example. The New York State Attorney General laid out the charges to Donaldd Trump and his 3 Adult Children Don Jr, Eric, and Ivanka. They also laid out the conseqences of a conviction whih most likely carried a lengthy prison sentence and a hefty monetary fine. Trump and his Associates decided to pay a fine and sign a binding agreement with New York State to not operate any charity of any kind within the boundaries of New York any violation of any kind would result in their arrests and confinement without bail until the outcome of their trial. What Donald Trump and his Father Fred feared the most was a Jury trial made up of citizens of New York City.

Ibanez Series S,"What's a good electric guitar I might start with that has a wider - but not too wide - neck, so I can get my fingers on all cords?","What your looking for is a Wizard II neck. They have a thin re-enforced neck with a compound radius fingerboard, they are manufactured by Ibanez. Check out the RG 300 series or if you have rich parents try and get a JEM or signature model. These necks were built for flashy 80's style shredding Ala eddie vanhalen, randy roades, steve vai etc. In other words maximum playability.   Other than that any compound radius 16' and larger would be ideal. Compound radius necks are flatter and wider than your standard single radiused neck.  The Fender c-style necks by comparison are on the smaller end and have a 7.25' fret board radius (this can change depending on model/year), and they have a fairly thin neck. Gibson les paul necks are much fatter almost like holding a block of wood, and have a radius of 12'. Remember numbers help for comparisons sake but every neck resonates and sustaines differently & their shapes/materials vary drastically as well (V-shape, D-shape, Wedge-shape, tapered, laquered/unlaqured).",https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-good-electric-guitar-I-might-start-with-that-has-a-wider-but-not-too-wide-neck-so-I-can-get-my-fingers-on-all-cords,"Fretboard radius has nothing to do with string spacing. It's a measure of how much of a curve there is in the fretboard. A guitar neck is usually a little under two inches wide, so if you imagine cutting a 2"" section out of the middle of a cylinder with a radius of, say, 7.25"" you'd see a significant curve in the outer edge. A similar sized chunk from a cylinder of 12"" radius would be less curved. Small radius necks are often considered to feel more comfortable, but may suffer from strings ""choking"" on the fretboard on wide bends higher up the neck. Flatter radius necks won't choke, but may not feel as good to play. A compound radius neck has a different degree of curvature in different areas to try to get the best aspects of both.
Neck width and string spacing aren't affected by radius- there's no reason why a neck can't have a narrow radius but be very wide, or why a wide neck can't still have very narrow string spacing and lots of space between the outer strings and the edges of the fretboard. The depth and the profile are separate again- some of the more upmarket guitar brands actually offer different necks as options on their instruments- PRS used to offer ""wide fat"" and ""wide thin"", G&L have perhaps half a dozen different neck options to choose from on some models, each with different combinations of fretboard radius, string spacing, neck width and profile (C, D, V etc.). If you look at the number of options some of the manufacturers of custom guitar parts (Warmoth, WD etc.) offer, the mind boggles. Where we can agree is that the numbers don't necessarily tell you what a guitar will feel and sound like to play, so there's no substitute for actual hands-on experience with a range of instruments.",,,,

Window of Person‚Äî Your Eyes and You Shit are the window of you. Your eyes tell a lot of things so is your shit. Because eyes are lets world inside of your body and shit outside.

It took seven long years, the birth of my son, a letter I wrote to my uncle (the supposed ‚Äúgreedy"" sibling), and a lot of coercion from both myself and a mutual friend of my father's and my uncle's, but the mutual friend and I were able to work together to bring my family back together to reconcile, and my dad and his brother got to see each other in a happy, memorable setting as we gathered with old friends for a poker game, and my uncle was able to meet my infant son, just once -- my dad has this as his last memory of his brother -- my uncle passed away two days before Thanksgiving the following year. On Thanksgiving, at his wake, while it's never been revealed to me the things that were heard or said because it's known that I would be crushed and would probably say something to the wrong person, I do know that my uncle's wife said some things to my father and the other siblings which revealed to everyone at long last, that she was the puppet master behind how the family had split apart the way they all had when my grandmother passed, and from what I understand, not only did she not appear the least bit remorseful, but she didn't appear grief stricken, even, that my uncle had just passed.

Fashion 2022,Why would Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes do a one-year deal for 2021?,"As I said in another answer to a similar question, only this man and the Mercedes team can tell you for certain:  Yes, that‚Äôs right, it is seven times WDC Sir Lewis Hamilton. Nonetheless we can speculate a bit given what we‚Äôve been told so far. Consequentially it‚Äôs probably, in part, about the new rules and regulations which kick in from 2022 onwards. Although not hugely significant they could make the difference between Mercedes still dominating the grid to having to battle to stay in front. We also need to take into consideration whether Sir Lewis still wants to keep racing. As his boss Toto Wolff has said: As long as he enjoys racing, I think he is very capable of going longer. So I think this is the crux of the matter -  As long as he enjoys racing‚Ä¶ Wolff has also said that Hamilton does have interests elsewhere, not just about ensuring motorsport in general becomes more inclusive, but also life outside of motorsport. Needless to say Hamilton, by limiting his contract to just one year, ensures a whole lot of options open up at the end of 2021. He can either stay, especially if he doesn‚Äôt win another WDC, or if he does win another he can move onto other ventures knowing that he has achieved the impossible by becoming the holder of numerous F1 records including eight WDC trophies. And that isn‚Äôt going to be bettered anytime soon. In a similar fashion it also keeps the door open for Mercedes as to what they do with this driver:  George Russell is undoubtedly lined up to join the team in 2022. With Hamilton‚Äôs plans uncertain for 2022 and beyond, Mercedes can still bring in Russell but they now have a choice to keep Valtteri Bottas should Hamilton move on especially if he wins his eighth WDC. From the team‚Äôs point of view, this would ensure a level of stability, at least for their driver line-up, to counterbalance whatever instability the new regulations will cause to ensure they‚Äôre still at the competitive end of the grid.",https://www.quora.com/Why-would-Lewis-Hamilton-and-Mercedes-do-a-one-year-deal-for-2021,,,,,

Ibanez Series S,Which e-guitars should I look into when buying my next one? And what about amps? Read description please.?,"It depends on if you want more sound effects on your amp, and if you want a digital amp or a tube amp. Tube amps are going to be more expensive, but, watt for watt, are going to be louder and have much better tone. I wrote a blog on my site about amps:  Tube amps vs solid-state amps   I would recommend the Fender Super Champ, Fender Blues Junior, Marshall MG series, Vox VT20+, Line 6 Spider series, Fender Mustang, and the Roland Cube. Try out as many as you can and see what your style and budget dictate. As for the guitar, you have a lot of great options. The Epiphone DOT or ES-339 size is great for the blues and jazz. Ibanez Artcore or Gretsch Electromatics are right up that same alley. Fender American Standard Strat or Tele will do you well, and you can get them used for under your budget, allotting more to the amp. Fender has the Thinline Telecaster that is a semi-hollow version of its Telecaster and is a joy to play.  Les Pauls are great guitars, but they might be a bit heavy. You can get the Gibson Les Paul Studio worn series; it has a thinner 60's profile neck, and chambered body, reducing the weight significantly.  All of the guitars that I mentioned are well below your price limit, allowing you to spend more on a good amp, great cable, and maybe even some cool pedals like a compressor, delay, reverb, or slight overdrive.

Presidential Election,Who is more likely to win the presidential elections: Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders?,"Ok, let's start with the reasons why Bernie might win. The Bullish take on Bernie People like Bernie.  Bernie Sanders Favorable Rating s are better than than either those of  Hillary Clinton  or the  Democratic Party , and people are still getting to know him. People across the spectrum are cynical about crony capitalism (see the tea party), and Bernie has a strong record of trying to get money out of politics. He has been consistent, and just like a lot of Liberals have respect for Ron Paul, even if they disagree with him, people from across the spectrum respect Bernie Sanders, even if he is far to the left. He has a strong populist message, and as people hear it, they'll support him. Just look at what happened in NH and Iowa: he's leading in NH and has constantly been moving up in the polls in Iowa as voters get to know him. The same thing will happen everywhere else. Bernie sanders has drawn larger crowds and has more grass root enthusiasm. The Bearish Take on Bernie Bernie is popular with white progressives. That gives him a decent chance in Iowa and New Hampshire. Unfortunately, Iowa and New Hampshire are two of the whitest states in the U.S. (3rd and 7th respectively; Vermont is number 2). On top of that, the Democratic party isn't really that liberal: only 30% of democrats and democratic-leaning independents consider themselves economically liberal ( Democrats in the U.S. Shift to the Left (Gallup) ). Meanwhile, Clinton is getting 70-75% of the support of non-white democrats. Hillary is leading nationally by over 15 points, with over half of democrats supporting her. On top of that, historically, polls have significantly underestimated the chances of winning for candidates with broad support from inside the party: which Hillary has and Bernie doesn't. Finally, Clinton has been in the spotlight for the last 20 years: most people aren't likely to have their opinions changed by any negative attacks. Bernie Sanders has been relatively unscathed from the right: when he starts getting attacked for his socialism, you can expect his ratings to go down as he's attacked on policies that are far too liberal to have any chance to get through a Republican controlled congress. On top of that Clinton has a far better resume, and while not exactly young, is still younger than Bernie.   In other words, if you believe Bernie will win, you also believe that he will convince people who don't identify as liberal that he's the best candidate for them, which probably means convincing people to be a lot more liberal, and he needs to expand his support outside of his mostly white base. Most political observers (e.g.  Five-Thirty-Eight)  are skeptical that he can do that to a degree that significantly imperils Clinton's chances.",https://www.quora.com/Who-is-more-likely-to-win-the-presidential-elections-Hillary-Clinton-or-Bernie-Sanders,,,,,

Remember this bit - I'll get back to it in the end, when I finally tell you who I support. 2.  Because a good friend is the guy that tells you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear . The US president has every right to call the Israeli PM and go ballistic if circunstences merit it, for example. 3. Because the relations between the US and Israel transcend a person, or a party  (and before you trolls go ballistic on ""Israel gets all the aid!"" read this:  Noam Kaiser's answer to What are the criteria of US Foreign Military Aid?  You don't know jack shit... sorry, just facts). Our two countries, share very complex security and diplomacy circumstances, conduct a long, lasting relationship which endures highs and lows, but ultimately prevails based on trust and common values, and a connection that is deeply rooted. 4 . For me the United States stands for friends, partners, people and places I care about and ideals I hold dear.  I care for it too much to want it be run by someone inapt. So: sorry, THIS Israeli is NOT going to write anything about the Israeli ""angle"". There is none: A president that is good for the United States is good for Israel and much more than it.  Moving on. As you can see from my answer here,  Noam Kaiser's answer to What is Noam Kaiser's position on the economic left-right scale?  and from pretty much anything else I write, I'm Socially Liberal and Fiscally Conservative. So I wouldn't have a classic home by definition in either party. Then let's just look at the candidates, beginning with the Republicans.  You're kidding me right? This is what you came up with? This  is the best the Republican party has to offer? Jeb Bush?  Please not again, please no, I know people say he can't be worse than the second, but that's the thing about the Bush family - they are full of surprises (some of them in Florida). Just vote for Cheney and get it over with. I know he isn't running, but Cheney never let technicalities stop him... Donald Trump?  I'm sorry... you cannot be serious. No one thinking straight can really think Trump for president is a good idea. I'll just put these two answers here, and be done with it: Noam Kaiser's answer to Is it unfair to Donald Trump that TIME picked Angela Merkel of Germany ""Person Of The Year"" rather than Donald Trump? Noam Kaiser's answer to What do American and/or Israeli Jews think about the remarks Donald Trump has made towards Muslims? Do you support his views in how he plans to deal with Muslims as President? Sorry, I just physically can't write more on Trump as potential leader of the free world... ugh... Ted Cruz ? Are you mental?! I mean, I know he is, that's for sure, but are you?! He stands for everything that went wrong with the Republican party, beginning in the 80's, when it was hijacked by people who forgot that a classic conservative means a person who wants to limit government rights of meddling in the affairs of the individual, not a person who wants to limit the individual rights! This type of hijacking is why John McCain, the last normal candidate I can recall the Republicans ran for president had to take a loonie toons character with him as a vice president to be in the form of the craziest co-runner ever in the history of the US: Sarah Palin. Ted Cruz would be to the presidency, what Palin would have been to the vice presidency. My republican friends - your party has been hijacked. It's time to take a long hard look at 2 things: by who was it hijacked and where this situation will lead you - If you won't win these elections it will be because of them, not because the Democrats have a dream team.  And man, they don't. Let's move on to the Democratic party then,  (I know I skipped Rubio on the Republican slot, I think he's out of it, look for Ryan in the future of this party though, maybe ,  standing for nothing seems to keep you in the race)  which as Bernie Sanders said recently:  ""On our worst days ... we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate"" At least in the 2016 elections? He's right. Speaking of  Sanders , I like the guy, I'll admit it. We would all want our politicians this clean, fresh, different from what we have all gotten used to. But it won't work for the presidency. Sanders idealistic and in certain places naive approach will not make him, in my humble view, the right person to lead the United States forward on its domestic recovery track and has pretty much zero to offer internationally to re-establish the US global dominance nor any particular diplomatic insight. There's a place for him in politics, in leadership, we should want more of him, but he is not the commander in chief, and being a very clear cut free market capitalist that I am, I don't want him holding the wallet either. I'm not even touching how cluless he is on global matters, it's quite embarrassing. Which leads us to the Gmail account. Sorry, to  Hillary Rodham Clinton . It's just that they keep going on and on with those emails... fine, she fucked up there. We got it - Agreed. OK, so she has the charisma of roadkill, and the likability of border control. I'm not overwhelmed by this prospect, there is no shining candidate this time around, we concluded that. But here is what Clinton brings to the table: 1.  She's got experience,  oh hell yes she does, more in amount and more in relevance than all the others combined. Experience is something we all need in US president. 2.  She's tough , she's gutsy and resilient. This is not a person who crumbles under the pressure and she's proven that. 3.  She can build a team . Just ask her husband. And a leader is only as good as the team behind her/him. 4.  She knows the system  - well, in and out. She will be able to get things done because she played this game before. This is something we don't necessarily like, but it helps a leader accomplish. 5.  She is a global diplomacy veteran . And here is why this is important. Because she will face off with Putin and follow Obama Remember earlier, I wrote an American president should do right by the Americans first? That's Obama, believe it or not. If you just look at it in domestic American view: Lowest deficit in years, lowest unemployment since before Bush, best ratio of debt to GDP in a decade, lowest unemployment rates recorded in a long time, major US corporations and companies recovering, and yes - Healthcare (But Ted Cruz says he wants to ""turn America around""... crazy, I told you). This all comes after a shattered economy left by arguably the worst American president in the modern age, who fucked things up at home and beyond. In fact Obama did something very ""Republican"": He decided the world can wait. Home comes first. And he did good by the American economy and society. He basically had NO foreign policy, and his - lack of - handling of the Crimea crisis, Syria, the Mid east no-process, and who can forget this shining ""achievement"" -  Noam Kaiser's answer to What are the pros and cons of the Iran Nuclear Agreement announced on July 14, 2015?  and  Noam Kaiser's answer to Is the new Iran deal a ""bad deal""?  (And with all due respect, the CIA, NSA and SEAL Team Six got Bin Laden, it wasn't Michelle) - all this, had a crippling effect on U.S global diplomatic and military positioning. Basically, as far as world peace and leadership is concerned, Obama was over -realistic in his  ""hey, I can't help 'em if they can't help themselves "" and left the scene for the Russians, Chinese or for pure chaos. An absent landlord. He gets an A+ for Home-Ec and an F in History. Making Clinton the right person to step in. She won't turn things around within the US, she'll preserve what he started, and make sure she has a good team to do it, she knows the right people. What she can do - and probably will do - is a much better job at reestablishing the United States position as a global power, leading the world in peace and war, being the address in time of need, leading the assault, or the diplomatic effort or both, anywhere required. She knows how to do this. And, guys? We need you back in the driver seat...  So to summarize how I see it, again looking at the relevant candidates, In a gray, shallow, sometimes ridiculous field of poor options,  Clinton  a little more than stands out. I think she's your guy. Unless you want Melania Trump taking nude photos on Air Force 1. Yeah, she does that:  Melania Trump would be the only first lady to pose in the nude  ‚ÄãDon't get me wrong: She can do whatever she wants, but the first lady should stand for more that that. He seems to like it, but I don't think you want either of them in the White House.  Good luck buddies. And remember - elections are determined by the people who show up. Vote.  Epilogue: This is just MY opinion, this is what the question is about. I (well, Michael Vogel actually) wrote that ""who cares"" disclaimer, which emphasizes that point. So the fact that some or most disagree with me, does not change the fact that... well, this is my opinion - THIS is the correct answer to THIS question, scroll up to remind yourselves what it was).

Tricking,What are some cool PHP tricks?,"Return a result and error from a function.
Comes in real handy when creating validation functions.
 list($result, $error) = validateString($str);  if($error){   // Do something. }  function validateString($str){   return array(false, ""String is invalid""); }
 PHP: list - Manual
  Output buffering can be really useful:
 ob_start(); // Start capturing output. print ""this""; echo ""that""; $buffer = ob_get_contents(); ob_end_clean(); // End capturing.  // ... Do some stuff here...  print $buffer; // Prints ""thisthat"".
 Output Control Functions
  I recently learned about these useful Ctype functions:
 ctype_alpha($str); // Only letters ctype_digit($str); // Only numbers ctype_space($str); // Only whitespace ctype_print($str); // Only printable characters ctype_alnum($str); // Numbers or letters // And there's more...
 PHP: Ctype - Manual
  This isn't really useful, but shows you know a thingortwo about PHP:
 echo ""hello"", ""world"";
Notice, the strings are separated by a  comma,  not a period.
 PHP: echo - Manual
  PHP comes with some amazing string functions. For example, if you wanted to check for common word mispellings:
 levenshtein - Manual
Find what words  sound  the same:
 soundex - Manual
Check if text is similar:
 similar_text - Manual   A better way to do a lot of IF statements:
 switch(TRUE){   case email_is_valid($email):     // Do something.     break;   case username_is_valid($user):     // Do stuff.     break;   case pass_too_short($pass) && pass_not_save($pass):     // Other stuff.     break; }
Cool part is, you can your pieces of code ""collapse"" by not putting a break in.
  Settings a $count variable when looping through a for loop.
 for($i = 0, $count = count($my_array); $i < $count; $i++){   // Do loopy things. }
Notice that this is very different from:
 for($i=0;$i<count($my_array);$i++){}
If you create your loop this way, the count() function gets hit on every loop cycle.

Tricking,"In C or C++, what are your favorite pointer tricks?","I‚Äôll start with an important warning about  aliasing , then cover my three favorite pointer tricks, which are the  double pointer  trick for linked list traversal, finding the  length of an array  without  sizeof  and division, and the Linux kernel‚Äôs  container_of  macro . Strict aliasing rules Before you start using pointer tricks, you should be sure to understand the language‚Äôs aliasing rules. From the C99 standard ¬ß6.5, Expressions:

 7. An object shall have its stored value accessed only by an lvalue expression that has one of the following types:
 a type compatible with the effective type of the object, a qualified version of a type compatible with the effective type of the object, a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to the effective type of the object, a type that is the signed or unsigned type corresponding to a qualified version of the effective type of the object, an aggregate or union type that includes one of the aforementioned types among its members (including, recursively, a member of a subaggregate or contained union), or a character type.
Historically, you could get away with violating these rules, and programmers would use pointer casting to access representations of the same data using different types. But modern optimizing compilers will often break that kind of code, because the rules allow them to assume that pointers of different types do not point to the same region of memory! See the  GCC documentation  and  Understanding Strict Aliasing . Linked list manipulation with double pointers Consider the problem of inserting a number into a sorted linked singly-linked list.
 struct node {     int data;     struct node *next; } *head;  A typical solution has two pointers and a few special cases to get right:
 void insert(struct node *new_node) {     struct node *node = head, *prev = NULL;     while (node != NULL && node->data < new_node->data) {         prev = node;         node = node->next;     }     new_node->next = node;     if (prev == NULL)         head = new_node;     else         prev->next = new_node; }  But with clever use of a  pointer to a pointer , you can do this with no extra cases:
 void insert(struct node *new_node) {     struct node **link = &head;     while (*link != NULL && (*link)->data < new_node->data)         link = &(*link)->next;     new_node->next = *link;     *link = new_node; }  The same trick applies to node deletion. It‚Äôs also useful to store the  previous  links this way in non-circular doubly-linked list implementations, such as the Linux kernel‚Äôs  hlist  ( types ,  operations ). (Of course, in C++, you don‚Äôt need to write your own linked lists, since the STL provides  std::list  and  std::slist .) How long is that array? It‚Äôs typical to see loops like
 int arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13}; for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]); i++)     printf(""%d\n"", arr[i]);  That  sizeof  nonsense is ugly, and it‚Äôs often hidden behind a macro. But we can simplify it using pointer arithmetic.
 &arr  is a pointer to the array. It points at the same memory address as  arr ‚Äîwhich decays to a pointer to its first element‚Äîbut with a different type, whose size is that of the entire array rather than of just one element. That means that  &arr + 1  points at the address after the end of the array. Dereferencing to  *(&arr + 1)  gives the address after the end of the last element (which is again the same address with a different type). Finally, we can subtract the pointer to the first element to get the length of the array:  *(&arr + 1) - arr . The equivalence between array indexing and pointer arithmetic simplifies this to  (&arr)[1] - arr == 1[&arr] - arr , saving a pair of parens. This might be that equivalence‚Äôs only practical use outside the  International Obfuscated C Code Contest .
 for (int i = 0; i < 1[&arr] - arr; i++)     printf(""%d\n"", arr[i]);  Having done that, it‚Äôs even simpler to make the iteration variable a pointer too:
 for (int *p = arr; p < 1[&arr]; p++)     printf(""%d\n"", *p);  (C++11 provides the wonderful new  for (int n : arr)  syntax for this.) The  container_of  macro The Linux kernel source includes this useful macro that‚Äôs invaluable for writing object-oriented code in C. I‚Äôve simplified its definition to remove GCC-specific extensions:
 #define container_of(ptr, type, member) \     (type *)((char *)(ptr) - offsetof(type, member))  It‚Äôs used as follows (example taken from  linux/Documentation/kobject.txt ). Imagine you have a structure containing another structure:
 struct uio_map {     struct kobject kobj;     struct uio_mem *mem; };  Then, given a  struct kobject  that you know is a member of a  struct uio_map , you might be tempted to get the outer  struct uio_map  just by casting the pointer:
 struct kobject *kp = ‚Ä¶; struct uio_map *u_map = (struct uio_map *)kp;  But that leads to fragile code that would be broken by the addition of another member to the beginning of  struct uio_map . Instead, write:
 struct uio_map *u_map = container_of(kp, struct uio_map, kobj);",https://www.quora.com/In-C-or-C++-what-are-your-favorite-pointer-tricks,"I tried out the array length trick with the following:  #include <stdio.h>   int other_func(char *str){     if (!str)         return 0;      return 1[&str] - str - 1; }  int main(void){      char arr[] = ""some string"";       printf(""%d\n"", other_func(arr));      return 0; }  This didn't return the proper length. However, if I malloc `arr` first, it works fine. I think it stems from ""some string"" being at a much lower memory address (in the text portion if I remember correctly) than where the stack is at the time `other_func` is called. Am I correct?",container_of() looks like it would be very useful! Thanks,"Linus Torvalds calls people who dont get your first trick - 'people who dont get pointers'. Admittedly I am one of them. I don't get the last line of the code. Consider this list - 3   5   7
Assume  'new_node' contains 4. So our new_node needs to be inserted between nodes containing 3 and 5. So the while loop runs once and 'link' now contains 'address of the node containing 5'. Next we have -
new_node->next = *link;
*link = new_node; First line is okay. 2nd line - how does it ensure that the next pointer of node containing 3 now points to new_node ?",So I guess this mean u can use this solution only if the compiler knowns the array‚Äôs length? Am I right? What if I want to use dynamic length arrays?,
Tricking,What are some useful Bash tricks you've seen or written? I‚Äôm looking for tricks not apparent by reading the manual or random init.d scripts.,"Shortcuts on the current line
 Ctrl+A: move to the start of the current line Ctrl+E: move to the end of the line Alt+F: move to the end of the next word Alt+B: move to the start of the current or previous word
 Ctrl+T: swap the two last characters, e.g.:  sl<C-t>  ‚Üí  ls Alt+T: swap the last two words, e.g.:  foo bar<M-t>  ‚Üí  bar foo
 Ctrl+U: cut the text of the current command  before  the cursor. Ctrl+W: cut only the  word  before the cursor. Ctrl+K: cut the text of the current command  after  the cursor. Ctrl+Y: paste the previously cut text after the cursor. This is useful when you have typed a long command and realize that you forget to do something before, e.g.:
 % ./my_long_command -v -u foobar -t -x<C-U> % ./do_something_before % <C-Y><enter> # paste and execute ./my_long_command‚Ä¶
 Alt+U: uppercase the next word, e.g.:  ls<C-a><M-u>  ‚Üí  LS Alt+L: lowercase the next word, e.g.:  LS<C-a><M-l>  ‚Üí  ls Alt+C: capitalize the next word, e.g.:  foo<C-a><M-c>  ‚Üí  Foo
 Ctrl+L: clear the screen, leaving the current line at the top. Ctrl+_: undo (incremental).
If you don‚Äôt have an Alt (Meta) key, you can use escape:  <esc>u  is the same than  <M-u> .
 Note:  these shortcuts are available with any program which uses Readline, like most command-line interpreters ( python ,  irb ,  node , etc). Macros
Bash allows you to record macros, and replay them after. AFAIK, you can only execute the last recorded macro. Type  <C-x>(  to start the recording,  <C-x>)  to end it, and  <C-x>e  to re-execute it. History interaction
To fully interact with Bash history, you have to understand three things:  Event Designators ,  Word Designators  and  Modifiers . Event designators are basically used to pick a command you typed before. Here are them:
 !n  refer to the command  n . For example,  !1  refer to the  first  command of your history. I don‚Äôt know if some people use that, since Bash history is usually big (mine contains 4000+ commands). More interesting,  !-n  refer to the command  n  lines back. It means that  !-1  is the last command. There‚Äôs a synonym for that:  !! . So,  sudo !!  let you run again the last command, preceded by  sudo . You can also run again the command before the last one with  !-2 . !str  refer to the most recent command starting with  str . So, if you recently executed  make , you can execute it again with  !ma  (or even  !m  if you didn‚Äôt use  mv  after it). !?str?  refer to the most recent command containing  str  (you may remove the trailing  ?  if the string is the last part of the command). Say you recently executed your awesome Python script which displays pictures of cats all over your screen. But it‚Äôs in a really deep directory so you‚Äôd have to type again something like  ./foo/bar/python/awesome.py , and you‚Äôre  very  lazy. With this command, you can type  !?aw? , and, assuming you didn‚Äôt type a more recent command containing the string  aw , it‚Äôll execute your awesome script again! !#  refer to the entire command line typed so far. So  cd ..;!#  is equivalent to  cd ..;cd ..; . You can use it many times, so  cd ..;!#!#  is equivalent to  cd ..  four times.

Word designators are following event designators. The two must be separated by a colon ( : ), unless the word designator begins with  ^ ,  $ ,  * ,  - , or  % . Also, ‚Äú if a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as the event ‚Äù (from the Bash Reference Manual). Here are them:  $  refer to the last argument. So  !!:$  refer to the last argument ( $ ) of the last command ( !! ). It may be shortened to  !$ , e.g.:
 ~% mv myfile.c foo/bar/ ~% cd !$ ~/foo/bar%
You can also loop over the last argument of all previous commands with Alt+. (thanks to  Jacobo de Vera ). n  refer to the  n th word.  0  is the first word (the command). Say you want to edit the second file mentioned in the following command with vi:  cat foo.h foo.c bar.c . Use  vi !!:2 . ^  refer to the first argument (this is equivalent to  1 , see previous word designator).  !!:^  (the first argument of the previous command) may be shortened to  !^ . E.g.:
 cat foo.c bar.c vim !^ # edit foo.c %  refer to the word matched by the most recent  ?str?  search. x-y  refer to a range of words.  -y  is equivalent to  0-y  while  x*  is equivalent to  x-$ , and  x-  is equivalent to  x-$  without the last word. Also,  *  is equivalent to  1-$ . Here are two examples:
 cat foo.c foo.h vim -p !* # edit foo.c and foo.h

 echo I love Quora !!:- Twitter # echo I love Twitter
Here,  !!  is the previous command, while  -   is an equivalent of  0-  which is itself equivalent to  0-$  without the last word. So this shortcut execute the previous command again with stripping its last argument and replacing it with ‚Äú Twitter ‚Äù (hey, that‚Äôs just an example).
Now that you can access previous commands and extract some words from them, you may want to modify them to execute modified versions of these commands. Modifiers are here for that! Note that they must be preceded by a colon. Here are them:  h  removes a trailing path component:
 cd /home/baptiste/Mail !!:h # cd /home/baptiste
You can use twice (or more!):
 ls foo/bar/xyz !!:h:h # ls foo t  is the opposite of  h , it removes everything except the trailing path component:
 /bin/ls !!:r # ls r  removes a trailing suffix:
 rm config.rc.save vim !^:r # edit config.rc
In this example,  !^  is the first argument of the previous command. e  is the opposite of  r , it removes everything except the trailing suffix. p  prints the new command but doesn‚Äôt execute it:
 /bin/ls !!:r:p # display ""ls"" s/old/new/  substitutes  new  for the first occurrence of  old :
 cd bat # oops, wrong directory !!:s/t/r/ # cd bar
You can use any delimiter you want (e.g.:  :s+old+new+ ), and omit the trailing delimiter if this is the last character of the line. Also, if you use  &  in  new , it‚Äôll be replaced by  old  (use  \&  if you want to avoid it).
 ^old^new^  is a shortcut for  !!:s/old/new/ . gs/old/new/  substitutes  new  for every occurrence of  old . It works like  s . Gs  substitutes  new  for the first occurrence of  old  in each word:
 echo bar car daar !!:Gs/a/u # echo bur cur duar
 String expansion & ranges
 Expand strings with curly braces:  xxx{A,B,C}  is expanded to  xxxA xxxB xxxC . This is very useful in some cases where you need to use a filename twice with small differences, e.g.:
 % mv {,.}foo # mv foo .foo % cp foo.rb{,.bak} # cp foo.rb foo.rb.bak % vim -p myfile.{c,h} # vim -p myfile.c myfile.h Loop over a range of numbers:
 # will print 17, 18, ‚Ä¶, 42 for i in {17..42}; do echo $i; done

This works with letters, too:
 # will print a, b, c, ‚Ä¶, z for i in {a..z}; do echo $i; done

You can use a different step:
 # will print a, c, e, g, ‚Ä¶, y for i in {a..z..2}; do echo $i; done

 # will print 10, 20, ‚Ä¶, 100 for i in {10..100..10}; do echo $i; done

You can also try the  seq  function which does the same things, with a little more options.  Variables
There are  a lot  of predefined variables, here are some useful ones:  $OLDPWD  contains the path to the last directory you were in, e.g.:

 [~/one/path]% cd ~/another/path [~/another/path]% mv $OLDPWD/myfile ./ # move a file # from the last working directory to the current one

 cd -  is a shortcut for  cd $OLDPWD  (thanks to  Simon Josi ). $RANDOM  gives you a random integer between 0 and 32767. If you assign it a value, it seeds the  random number generator .  Miscellaneous Tricks
 You can include a file using a dot ( . ), here is what I use in my  .bashrc :
 for f in ~/‚Ä¶/functions/*.sh; do     if [ -x $f ];     then         . $f; # include the file     fi done

Ibanez Series S,I am buying an electric guitar. Should I invest more in the amplifier rather than in the guitar?,"Invest more into the guitar. There is a minimum level of instrument you'll want for a comfortable learning experience. Yes, ""the masters"" can make any ol' beater sound amazing, but it's a different story for beginners. BUT, and this is a mistake I made), make sure you get an amp that sounds good, or you will not love playing your new guitar. My first amp (from back in the 80's) was not a good amp, and I was inexperienced enough to not realize that. Though you may eventually want to get a tube amp, I strongly suggest picking up a Fender Mustang or similar inexpensive ""modelling amp"" as your first amp. The lower end versions of those amps are generally not very expensive (relatively speaking), and in addition to sounding nice, will give you a chance to play around with a variety of effects and such, which is a lot of fun. Also, don't worry about getting a lot of wattage, in a ""parlor"" setting, a 10w amp can easily play along side an upright piano, and will probably drown it out at the higher settings. I usually practice with a 1w tube amp, and it can get pretty loud in a smaller room. So get a nice inexpensive guitar like one of the Squire Classic Vibe series (much better than you'd expect for the price), or maybe an Ibanez, and a small modelling amp, and jam on.",https://www.quora.com/I-am-buying-an-electric-guitar-Should-I-invest-more-in-the-amplifier-rather-than-in-the-guitar,,,,,

Ibanez Series S,"What is your opinion of late 70's - mid 80's Matsumoku-made guitars? How do they compare with, say, modern Cort or World Musical Instruments guitars?","They‚Äôre usually quite well made in a time where QC from many American companies was quite bad. Early examples are really nothing that special and play like a mid level Squier. Now here‚Äôs where I may catch flak, while some stuff in the ‚Äúlawsuit‚Äù era (there was no lawsuit involving Matsumoku, a cease and desist was sent to Hoshino who made guitars under the Ibanez name but it was reportedly settled out of court.) was good but I feel at times they can be a little overrated. The bolt on Gibson copies are good and quite gigable but play like a low to midrange Epiphone. Of course they also had more ornate versions with nicer materials (those are the ones that are worth the hype). But I believe Matsomoku hit its peak from the late 70‚Äôs until it‚Äôs closure in 87‚Äì88. The Japanese have a great ability to copy something down to the smaller details BUT I feel their best work was when they took these old traditional designs and made changes to make it their own. That‚Äôs when you start seeing the kind of innovation that would give the incentive to choose it over the big 3 of brands. I feel if you want Matsumoku‚Äôs magnum opus I‚Äôd look for the Aria PE series, those felt like a super car version of a Les Paul in my opinion, Electra Workingman is another good one, any neck through Matsomoku guitar will be of superb quality.

Ibanez Series S,Does the type of wood of an electric guitar have an effect on its tone?,"I can only speak for myself, but I can certainly differentiate between the tone of alder and mahogany body on a Strat type electric guitar. Although as others have mentioned, it would not be reasonable to compare two instruments not only built from different materials, but also employing  very different construction methods  such as a Gibson type fixed neck or a Fender type bolt-on neck. I would state unequivocally that it  is  possible to hear how warm or cutting the acoustic tone is of a given electric guitar, as well as the quality of the sustain and resonance, among other characteristics. Once the instrument is amplified such tonal differences become too affected by the content of the signal chain to remain objective, yet despite that I can certainly hear the difference between a Les Paul, an ES-335, a Strat and a Telecaster, to menton the best known models. These are however examples of quite different instruments, and in the case of most Strats and Teles you are also hearing the very different sound of single coil pickups against the humbuckers fitted to Les Pauls and ES-335 semi-acoustics. Despite that, I would have to also concede that I was very surprised to hear how close a Telecaster can come to the sound of a hollow body jazz guitar when using the neck pickup and the tone control rolled off. (You only need to listen to the late great Canadian jazz guitarist Ed Bickert to hear that for yourself). But that is due in part to the combination of an alder body with a maple neck and rosewood fingerboard. So let's take a specific example of an Ibanez 'S' series superstrat with a mahogany body compared with the sound of an Ibanez superstrat with a basswood body - both fitted with humbucking pickups by the way. To my ears the mahogany bodied Ibanez always sounded muddy, and I ended up selling it in frustration. An alder or basswood body with the same setup would cut through far better in the mix, and despite the humbuckers would retain more of the typical Strat tone when desired. I strongly disagree with those who discount the wood entirely from the sound equation when they state that there is no tonal difference produced by diffeeent woods. One of my criteria for choosing an instrument is  how it sounds acoustically.  You can even touch the tip of a screwdriver to different parts of the instrument and put the head of the screwdriver against your ear. That will effectively amplify the sound coming through the body, and you will certainly hear the tone of the instrument. If it sounds warm and resonang, then so much more so when amplified. But if it sounds tinny and dead, chances are it will nog sound much better amplified. But it is true to say that there are many factors which combine to provide an instrument with its overall characteristic tone - even  before  it is amplified - as several answers explain in detail. It would be difficult to quantify how great an effect any of these had upon the tone  individually , so you would need to test the sound of otherwise  identical  instruments with only different woods being used. But you would need to include different neck and fingerboard materials also, as these also contribute to some extent to the tone of the instrument. I believe that there is quite likely some sort of psycho-acoustic effect involved, as the impression of such characteristics as sustain can affect one's perception of tone. What I mean is that sustain is such a atrongly desired characteristic that it may be difficult to separate it from the qualitative perception of tone. In other words the tendency is for a guitarist to equate good sustain characteristics with a 'good' tone - but in fact the actual tone may not be anything special. Once you have a good narual ringing sustain acoustically there is a great deal you can do with outboard EQ and processing, plus the sound tailoring characteristics of the amplifier which can all transform the sound subtly or radically. There are certain instruments conceived with the objective of being as  tonally neutral as possible,  as is the case with Steinberger electric guitars. The earliest designs were made from cabon fibfe composite, and later models featured a cf composite neck with a  wooden  body. These instruments sound totally different from all wood constructed electrics, and derive their tone almost entirely from the signal chain -intentionally.",https://www.quora.com/Does-the-type-of-wood-of-an-electric-guitar-have-an-effect-on-its-tone,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,What is the recommended string gauge for the Ibanez SA Series Electric Guitar?,"Basically it just boils down to what you prefer. If you want easy to play and bend strings start with .008`s. I prefer .009`s because I do not want to bend the chords, but still bend individual notes. The lighter the strings the easier it is to throw the chord out of pitch. Hendrix used .009`s with an average string height. But he would play what ever was one the guitar till he changed strings. Stevie Ray Vaughn used .011 tuned down a step to make them easier to bend. Hendrix never tuned down when he started, but did later on. Many of Jimi`s songs are in standard tuning, but some are tuned down a half step or more. On one live album he is tuned down a step and a half, 3 frets. If you want to play with other instruments, like a piano or other keyboard your best to tune to standard and use a light string. Lighter strings do break more frequently, but mostly after they are dead any way ( no twang , sustain ). Manufactures recommend changing strings after ever 40 hours of playing time. They rust, get dirt on the back side and get dented when finger pressure is put on the fret. This makes them sound dead or out of tune. Billy Gibbons makes and plays .007 strings that he named Reverend Willy`s Mexican Lotto strings.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-recommended-string-gauge-for-the-Ibanez-SA-Series-Electric-Guitar,,,,,
Presidential Election,What are the underlying causes of Twitter‚Äôs heightened relevance in the 2016 US Presidential election?,"Social media market share has never been more important for political candidates. More Americans are spending time online, instead of in front of the TV. That means that social media, including Twitter, has the potential to influence voting decisions more than ever before. Consequently, audience participation in the social media side of the election is huge. According to Crowdbabble, Hillary Clinton attracted a total 18,056,925 likes, replies, and retweets from June 1 to September 19, 2016 alone. She averages 9,616 likes, replies, or retweets per tweet.

Presidential Election,Will Hillary Clinton win the Presidential election?,"Yes, Hillary will win, I have thought so all along. There are a couple of big reasons why she will win. The political elite of both parties want her to win. When they run for office as a Senator or Congress usually they are either middle class or a little bit wealthy.

Hillary is a part of the old school political class and they know she will keep the gravy rolling for them as one of the established political group. The old politicians will make sure she wins. Even if it means playing games with the FBI to make sure that the day before the election there is positive news about Hillary. Wall Street adores Hillary and wants her to win. She gave speeches to Wall Street bankers and told them that she will do everything in her power to make sure they are well taken care of. Then she told Wall Street she has to lie to the voters about it and not to worry, she is only going to lie to get votes so she can protect them. Wall Street and big money really want her to win and they will do all they can to make sure she wins. Hillary will win, so you can pop out the champagne now and start rejoicing and if you have the day off tomorrow, party through the night and all day long.

Presidential Election,"Which issues ""will"" decide, versus ""should"" decide, the 2012 presidential elections?","Will Decide: Charisma and Likability
It's unfortunate, but many americans pick who they're going to vote for based on perceived likability. Whether it was George W. Bush's folksiness vs. Al Gore's stiffness or Bill Clinton's southern charisma vs. Bob Dole's uncomfortable uncle-ness, general elections are usually decided by this kind of non-relevant information. Should decide: Experience
Both Obama and Mitt Romney, by the time the election happens will have (roughly -- Romney by a couple months) the same amount of ""executive experience"" -- this is important. I think the American people paid a price with Obama in that he's had to spend much of his first term learning how to be an executive, rather than a legislator. My general feeling is that that's why the Healthcare debate went on so long, and why he spent his mandate on negotiating rather than leading. That ""executive experience"" thing is actually a big deal, and it costs the taxpayers millions, if not billions of dollars to have a president that learns on the job. Will Decide :  Persuasiveness of Campaign Advertising and IE Advertising
A much heralded ""more than a billion dollars"" will be spent on this campaign, and most of that money will likely go into advertising, and the lions share of that advertising will be spent on television. But the intent of advertising is never to inform, it's to persuade -- either to persuade you to vote, or to persuade you to shell out your hard earned money. It's never to tell you the truth. We're also going to have a huge swarm of last-minute advertising from independent expenditures and superPACs that will hopefully cause us to abandon our television viewing habits. It's going to be really quite something this year between labor day and election day. Should Decide: Social Networks of Influence around Candidates
It's a shame people don't use websites like littlesis.org which profile the social networks around our candidates and the people in control in Washington. A candidate's character, who they surround themselves with, and who they attract money from (in context) are better predictors of what it is that they will actually do once in office than their advertisements or campaign speeches are. Will Decide: Austerity vs. Jobs
Even though the economy is starting to recover, we're still having a debate in this country over whether or not government can ""afford"" certain programs -- things like TARP and ARRA, to Healthcare, to even established programs like Social Security and Medicare. Much of this is a question about what the role of government is, and fundamentally what it should provide. Should Decide: Efficiency and Adaptability
As important as the debate of the role of government is to have, it's not the right frame. While I respect the question that maybe the role of government shouldn't be to provide things like ""medicare"" -- it's unlikely a helpful conversation at the present time, as the electorate isn't going to allow for ""cancelling out medicare"" A more pragmatic discussion should be about how we spend our money, and how government can keep up with Moore's Law. Right now procurement law all but guarantees that our money gets spent as inefficiently as possible, and goes to the worst people imaginable. Things like the GSA Schedule are exclusive programs that ensure a culture of corruption.  It's like this: America is tired and fat. Republicans say ""That's because our legs are taking up all our energy. We should cut them off."" Democrats say ""No, we just need to eat some more so that we have more calories to expend."" Both answers are preposterous, and what we ought to be doing is making our bodies more efficient.  Will Decide:   Unionism vs. Corporatism  One debate more worth having is the debate about labor unions and corporations and their influence in our political process. To an extent, unions impede progress through the preservation of jobs that may not be necessary (perhaps if unions always had their way, we'd still have guys in lighthouses?) and at the same time, corporations tend to convince government to serve their interests at the expense of the overall health of the nation. Should Decide: People vs. Organizations
The truth is that there's not much difference between a large labor union and a large corporation (other than the fact that a large corporation has lots more money than a large union) -- large organizations tend to be more sociopathic, and tend to be more interested in their own self-preservation (and the preservation of their management team's jobs). Neither are quite off the hook -- both tend to care more about themselves than they do the right answers. A debate worth having in this country is about how the influence of *large organizations* whether they be unions or corporations influence our politics and regulatory policy. It's likely we can't have that debate, because corporations want you to spend all your time thinking about how unions affect our elections, and unions want you to think exclusively about corporations. And since both of these types of organizations spend most of the money on elections, it'll be hard to have an honest dialogue.",https://www.quora.com/Which-issues-will-decide-versus-should-decide-the-2012-presidential-elections,Great Answer - thanks,,,,
Fashion 2022,Where are the EXO members?,"f o r m e r m e m b e r s KRIS WU  He is currently working  in China  and  the US  as a  soloist, actor, and model . After he left the group in 2014 as the first member ever, stating that the company never took care of his health issues - he was diagnosed with myocarditis  (a serious heart condition, that can be deadly in 20% of the cases) - , treated him more like a mechanical part and a slave rather than an actual human being and never gave him a bit of artistic freedom, he got into long legal battles with the company. The result of these ended up in the company‚Äôs favor, meaning that he lost the lawsuits he put against them and has been forced to stay signed up with SM until 2022, a year in which all EXO‚Äôs members‚Äô contracts officially come to an end. He is not doing any promotions under SM, they are not supporting him in any sort of way, but the company is still taking profits from all of his activities as he is technically still their artists. A bit messed up, yeah, I know. Because he is Canadian and fluent in English (the only member in EXO as a whole) he also works in the US and from time to time living in LA. He already made his Hollywood debut with the movie  The Return of Xander Cage  with  Vin Diesel or Samuel L. Jackson  and  Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets  alongside actors like  Cara Delevigne or Rihanna .  (With a cast of Valerian)   (The Return of Xander Cage) He is not really that known for his music as he is for his acting, but he had plenty of chances of being a mentor on different music programs -  Rap of China, CHUANG 2020 for example  - and is definitely a famous face in China -  ranking 8th on Forbes China Celebrity list last year (the only member of EXO who ranked higher is Lay, but about him later) .  Last year, he released a collaboration with Luhan, called ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù. Well, and as I already said in the beginning, he is interested in fashion a lot -  he even walked runaway once or twice . At the moment he is the ambassador for  Burberry  and  Louis Vuitton.  (His Burberry runway experience)   (Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2020 collection) . . . LU HAN  He is also working in China‚Äôs music and acting industry. His case with leaving EXO and SM is pretty much similar to Kris‚Äô one -  the only difference he is, that the reason he wanted to leave was the unfair treatment EXO-M was getting in comparison with their Korean sub-uni t -, but even his legal battles ended up in the exact same way, meaning that h e is also signed up under SM until 2022. On Weibo  (which is a Chinese social media platform for those who don‚Äôt know)  he has over 60 million followers, which is the most out of all Chinese members of the group. His music is cherished probably the most by the public in China and he is also praised a lot for his acting skills, which are a big part of the reason, why he is so famous.  I also read somewhere that if you go to China, you can see his face on almost every second billboard in every city, so that just confirms the fact he is a role model for Chinese people. As the only one out of the Chinese members,  he is in a relationship  with an actress she met while filming a TV drama. Her name is Guan Xiaotong and they are happily together for a pretty long while.   And he is just as well an ambassador of a fashion brand - in his case it is  GUCCI.  . . . HUANG ZITAO  He is also a  soloist  and  actor , but on top of that, he is  CEO of his own entertainment company. Out of the three former members, he is the only one who so-called win his legal battles, and therefore  his contract was terminated back in 2015 , meaning that he is freed from SM and doesn‚Äôt have to wait until 2022. From all three members,  he is the one with the smallest fanbase and influence  in the industry from what I have read about his current status. He acted a few times, but none of his movies got as good feedback as Luhan‚Äôs or Kris‚Äô movies did, mainly because all of them are these cringy love stories, resembling Wattpad stories if I were, to be honest with you =  that is my impression from what I have seen so far. His music work is similar -  his fanbase likes it, but it is not strong enough to make all people praise him for it . And just like his Chinese counterparts, he is an ambassador for a fashion brand, but in his case, it is  KAPPA , not any luxurious high-end fashion brand.  He has been a  mentor  on two seasons of a survival show program called CHUANG, and as a CEO of his own company, he even sends his trainees to these programs.   (Gift from me to those who wanted to see the three of them together again) And here you have a few videos for all of those who miss them being together:     c u r r e n t m e m b e r s LAY ZHANG  He is representing SM as a soloist in China. Many people are asking why is he not promoting with a group - it due to the political tension between China and Korea (because Lay is active in China, he would get in troubles for promoting with a k-pop group as China put a ban on k-pop) and due to SM wanting some of their artists to represent their name in China and fix the reputation they got there after three Chinese members leaving.  With Lay being the only Chinese member left in the group and him making his solo debut there when he was still promoting with a group, having already quite a big fanbase there, the company is now using him to promote the company name in China. He has a huge influence on the Chinese music market, similar to Luhan‚Äôs. If he was an actor too, he would definitely be even more famous than Luhan, but due to him only being in the music industry, he is still lacking a bit in influence and the size of the fanbase. On Weibo, he has over 40 million followers to give you some idea of what is the difference between him and Luhan.  (Him attending Grammy - Lay also has quite decent influence in the US, he collaborated with Alan Walker and Steve Aoki in past) But, he is way more respected in the music industry than his former groupmates. So far he won 40 awards for his solo work - he is producing his music, directing his music videos, and sometimes even taking a part in making the choreographies to his music. Just as his former Chinese members, he was also invited several times to be a mentor on survival shows like Idol Producer, where he was with Jackson from GOT7, and Idol Producer 2.  XIUMIN, D.O, SUHO These three guys are now serving the military. Xiumin went at the beginning of the last year, meaning he is going to be the first member to come back in December of this year.  D.O went as a second member, even though he still had time. He went earlier because he is going to film a movie once he will come back, which will be next year in May.  Suho as a leader of the group enlisted on May 14 this year, which is quite recently and will be back in November of the next year.  These three guys are right now inactive, because of their military service. From time to time they got free days and are able to meet the rest of the group, but none of them can participate in any public activity like performing on stage, recording a song, filming a movie or go for a photo shoot, because that is a violation of military laws, therefore you don‚Äôt see them anywhere on the internet. CHEN  As many of you know, Chen announced at the beginning of the year that he has a girlfriend and expects a baby with her, which caused a huge backlash from fans, who were protesting in front of the company building, demanding him to leave the group and calling him irresponsible for impregnating his girlfriend before marriage. From that moment, Chen is not really participating in any schedules. He had a private wedding and his wife gave birth to a girl, so right now he is spending the time with his family. The last time he was shown in any group related content was when they were sending Suho to the military.  He will soon have to do the same thing as he reached the age in which men have to enlist, but to that moment he will spend time with his family, so please respect that and give him privacy. KAI and BAEKHYUN  These two guys are part of another group under SM called Super M with a few other male idols from other SM groups, so from time to time they promote with the group, flying to the US as the group is targeted for the western music market. Their comebacks are not regular, so both of them have still time for their solo activities as EXO as a group is now inactive due to the members being in the military. Baekhyun released his second solo album called Candy, which was a huge hit and he is still promoting it on music shows and Kai is also preparing to make a solo debut as he already spoiled many things on his social media platforms.  Baekhyun will also be probably enlisting soon due to his age. SEHUN and CHANYEOL  Sehun and Chanyeol formed a sub-unit of EXO called EXO-SC last year and it was confirmed by the company that they will be doing a comeback in July. Chanyeol also became a part of studio NNG, which has its own YouTube channel which features both Chanyeol and Sehun a lot. Chanyeol was able to release two solo singles which he produces thanks to them and the studio also filmed a mini-documentary about him which is free for everyone to watch on their channel. Overall both Chanyeol and Sehun spend there a lot of time.  It is also possible that at the end of this year or beginning of the next one Chanyeol will have to enlist just like Chen and Baekhyun, leaving only two youngest members - Kai and Sehun as the only active members.",https://www.quora.com/Where-are-the-EXO-members,"Would you say these ex members are actually more successful now than they were with EXO?

That is: 87 ‚Äì 7 = 80 or 93 - 13 = 80 (whichever you could quickly calculate), and the 91 is simply the product of the deficiencies: -13 √ó -7= 91.    Careful  -

Don't make matter worse by replying in one word. That kills the talk. Try using cliffhangers. That intrigues the listener.

Fashion 2022,Is the California governor recall election a waste of time and effort since Gov. Newsom won again?,"A waste of money, absolutely‚Ä¶. A waste of time, well, that remains to be seen. Let‚Äôs examine this a moment. When Elder emerged as the front runner, the Repugs poured big bucks into his campaign. Commercials, YT and radio ads, they loaded the full spectrum of media with messages of terrible governance and rampant corruption under Newsome. They figured they had an orator on their hands, a radio talk show jock who could speak with ease and confidence, spreading their party lies with fervor and conviction. That he would appeal to some Dems voters because of his color.  Think the Repugs don‚Äôt take that into account in the most progressive state in the Union‚Ä¶? Yeah, don‚Äôt fool yourself.

They no longer want to hear the other side, they‚Äôve had enough of the lies and conspiracy. At this point, the GOP stands for loss of rights and fascism and the Texas abortion law is just a microcosm of this authoritarian new GOP and its ramifications are not lost on the state or its potential future under Repug control. A political party that would subvert the rights of women‚Äôs bodily autonomy have zero success of running in California. And the voters spoke.

Ibanez Series S,What is your personal favorite Strat-type guitar? Is it a Fender or from a different builder?,"My favourite are the Schecter SLS series guitars. They are carved top solid-body Superstrats. I like them because they look muscular but at the same time they‚Äôre easy to play. Despite of looking big, chunky and muscular they have thin flat profile necks which are extremely similar to the Wizard necks on Ibanez guitars. Their upper fret access is actually better than RG because Schecter contours the neck heel even on neck-though SLS models for easy upper fret access.
However I‚Äôm not fond of other Schecter guitars. Other Schecter guitars have rather thick and chunky necks. Among old-school Strat like guitars I like the Kramer Baretta, especially the made in Japan JK series models with non-tilted Holy-Grail banana headstock, angled humbucker at bridge, a noiseless single coil pickup at the neck and original Floyd Rose trem. It‚Äôs an offset hot-rod Strat and honestly it looks like something straight out of an 80‚Äôs hair metal music video. Some of them even had tiger and leopard print on them. Its controls are extremely minimalistic, just one volume knob and a three way micro toggle switch (it‚Äôs even smaller than the normal mini toggle switch found on other guitars) for switching pickups, that‚Äôs it nothing else.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-personal-favorite-Strat-type-guitar-Is-it-a-Fender-or-from-a-different-builder,,,,,

Ibanez Series S,What guitar string gauge do you prefer?,"For the past 20 years (though with a few long breaks due to schooling, etc.) I‚Äôve mostly played .009‚Äì.042 gauges. This is what I grew up knowing as the standard string gauge for electric guitars, and it is what came with the Ibanez RG series that I‚Äôve had (still have it) and played for all these years. I found it a good gauge to learn with, as it is very forgiving on the fingers, easy to bend, and relatively faster to play. In general, I‚Äôd say playing with 9‚Äôs feels like it takes less energy to press down on the strings, and as a bonus you can often get a lower action with it too. Fast forward a few years, I somehow got really motivated and went back to practicing scales and arpeggios seriously and diligently. Maybe this was a byproduct of too much time on YouTube getting re-inspired by guitar virtuosos like John Petrucci (anyone here remembers the Rock Discipline days?), and the new gen technical/speed monsters like Jason Richardson and Tim/Scott from Polyphia. Anyways, what actually happened was that I found myself practicing a lot more on an acoustic guitar that I always have lying around in the living room, since it was convenient to do so between TV shows, cooking, chores, etc. I‚Äôd only play with my electric during ‚Äúdedicated‚Äù practice time. Earlier this year, I decided to venture into the world of 7-strings and purchased a Sterling Majesty 7, which came with .010, .013, .017, .026, .036, .046, .056 gauge strings. At first, I thought this was a negative thing, and was prepared to switch back to 9‚Äôs at the next string change. But to my surprise, I actually found myself gravitating towards the Sterling a lot more than to my Ibanez in terms of what guitar I wanted to grab and play with. The guitars are significantly different from each other, sure. Different neck width, bolt-on vs set neck, different body shape, different weight, different floating bridge, HSH vs HH configuration, etc. But sitting back, I realized that the string gauges might be one of the bigger reasons for my current preference, and that there were two main reasons for this: Reason #1: Tone. I know it‚Äôs a bit of comparing apples to oranges since it‚Äôs not the same guitar, but I finally understood what people meant by fuller tone with heavier gauge strings. I mean, I had heard about it for decades, but this was the first time I truly felt/experienced it first hand. Not that the Ibanez sounds bad, but now that I have two guitars with two different string gauges, the difference was easy to tell when switching off. This is both with the guitars plugged in or unplugged. Reason #2: Playability and Feel. I‚Äôve always enjoyed the playability of lighter string gauges. Playing an acoustic guitar usually feels like a finger work out to me both on the right and left hands. I usually get burning fingertips regardless of how conditioned my callouses were. But as a result of playing more often with the much higher tension and action of an acoustic guitar, getting more precise and having better technique due to the increased practice time, and also having stronger fingers made playing with the 10s just as easy as I have always remember the 9s being. In fact, I found the 9s a bit too ‚Äúfloppy‚Äù now. I find myself pulling the low E off the fretboard from time to time, or bending strings past the desired pitch since the resistance is a lot lower now. I also find myself doing slight unintentional bends when doing arpeggios. On the picking hand, I now find myself having to hold back since it feels easier to pick too hard. (I don‚Äôt have a compressor through in my effects signal chain, so it‚Äôs a bit unpleasant to the ears). My least favorite part about the 9s now is that the strings feel a bit too thin, so I get this psychological feeling that a wire is cutting my finger tips when I play songs with a lot of sliding. I‚Äôm sure my new-found problems with the 9s due to perhaps increased playing time/stronger fingers can be solved by adjusting my playing and/or paying more attention to technique. But I have to say it was the first time during my time playing that the 10s felt more ‚Äúright‚Äù and just ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. My experience years ago was the opposite, and I went back to the 9s and stayed there for a long time. The true test would be to string my Ibanez with 10s again, and see how it compares with it using 9s, and how it compares against the Sterling. I‚Äôm on queue with the local guitar tech to have the Ibanez tuned-up and strung with 10s in the next few weeks. We‚Äôll see how that plays out. Conclusion is that perhaps string gauge preference can changes as your playing style, playing time, and technique changes. For most part, it seems that most people go towards heavier and heavier gauges as they evolve as guitar players. Perhaps the next step for me is to try them 10s with heavier bottoms?",https://www.quora.com/What-guitar-string-gauge-do-you-prefer,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Which guitar suits you best? ,"Thanx for the A2A Noam. I think some answers here missed your link lol. My result was Fender. Which is really NOT my personal choice. Ever since I was 10yrs old and saw Ace Frehley ripping on a Les Paul, I have been a Les Paul guy. My first guitar was a Montoya Les Paul copy. It was jet black with a bolt on neck and I absolutely LOVED it. It wasn‚Äôt easy to play at first, but luckily a friends father mades some adjustments and improved it for me. Over the next 40+ years I never lost that love of Les Pauls. I have never owned a Fender, real or copy until about 2wks ago. I built a ‚ÄúPartscaster‚Äù Tele. Got most of it in a kit by sheer luck. My brother ordered two by accident, so he graciously gave me one. I changed some of the hardware for better quality components, sanded & grain filled the body, cut the headstock to the Tele shape and painted it Maui Blue with traditional Nitrocellulose paint & clear gloss. She plays great and sounds like a Tele.  I had been eyeing Tele‚Äôs for about a year. Wanted a single coiled guitar for some contrasting tones on my recording projects. But after breaking her in, I returned to my beloved Les Paul‚Äôs. They just feel right to me. My current favorite is my 19‚Äô Gibson Les Paul Classic Gold top.  As you can see, I have a few Les Paul types. The flame top behind the Classic is my ‚Äò00 Epiphone Les Paul Standard. THAT guitar is such a joy to play. The second I picked it up in Sam Ash I just had to have it. It felt like an extension of my hands. The action is so low, you can barely slide a credit card between the fretboard and the strings. The tobacco burst behind that is a ‚Äò15 Les Paul Studio. I recently sold that one. I loved the way it felt, sounded and played, but once I got the Gold Top, she was just not being used enough and afforded me the ability to add some studio gear I would use on a daily basis. Before building the Tele, I bought another guitar. I needed a guitar with a Tremolo for some recording projects so I bought this one:  It‚Äôs a ‚Äò20 Ibanez RG450. While it does have the ‚ÄúFender‚ÄùStratocaster body shape, it doesn‚Äôt sound like one at all. It is what they refer to as a Super Strat. It has 2 Humbuckers and 1 single coil. I swapped out the bridge pickup for a DiMarzio Satur8 to recover the bass/mids that Floyd Rose Tremolo systems are known to take away. I also made sure to buy one with a Maple fretboard. All my other guitars have Ebony or Rosewood and I wanted something different, again for a different sound and because I never had one. She was very affordable and blew me away when I picked it up for the first time. The radius of the neck is vastly different from a Les Paul and even the Tele. It‚Äôs extremely flat which makes soloing easier. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy another Ibanez RG series and highly recommend them as a first electric. Same goes for the Epiphone, another great first guitar. Both will inspire you to WANT to play. The quality and playability of lower cost guitars these days is awesome. Wish it was like that in the late 70‚Äôs early 80‚Äôs. Our choices were very limited and the craftsmanship wasn‚Äôt as great.",https://www.quora.com/Which-guitar-suits-you-best,,,,,

Tricking,Puzzles and Trick Questions:  The cows story. What is the solution?," The solution is provided in the above picture in tabular format. Table 1 is first step ( assumption) and table 2 is the solution. Row header : S1 - S9 represent sons 1‚Äì9 The columns headed by the blue row represents the cows (1 says cow no.1, also since the litres delivered by the cow is equal to the number of the cow, it can also represent the no. of litres of milk given by the cow) The yellow highlighted row is the number of litres each son would get . Since 1,2,3‚Ä¶‚Ä¶81 is uniformly distributed , I arrived at table 1 by assuming that the father can give 1st 4 (1,2,3,4) and last 4(81,80,79,78) cows to 1st son, 2nd 4(5,6,7,8) & 2nd from (77,76,75,74) to 2nd son and so on. This leaves us 9 (numbers 37‚Äì45) cows behind which I have assigned in an increasing order to the 9 sons. Now, it is clear from table -1 , that for equal distribution , the sum should be 369. You can also arrive at this 369 by dividing the sum of series (1‚Äì81) , ie, 81*82/2 , by 9 (number of sons). Based on this I have altered the original distribution taking two columns at a time and arrived at table -2. I have arrived at table-2 by iterations from table-1.

Fashion 2022,Mitch McConnell is urging Senate Republicans to not agree with any electoral vote challenges. How do you feel about this?,"Frankly, that‚Äôs an act of self-preservation, both for McConnell and for the Republican Party. I should be clear:  no challenges to the Electoral College vote would actually work . For such a thing to happen, there are a few stages: First off, a member from both the House and the Senate must object to a given state‚Äôs Electoral College votes. With this done, both chambers would adjourn for a debate on the issue, and then reconvene in order to vote on the issue. Only if a majority of members in both chambers agreed  would the votes be discarded. This is fairly unlikely in the current climate, since the Democrats hold control of the House, whilst the Republicans will still have a Senate Majority on January 6th. Neither party is likely to vote to discard any EC results. More to the point, even if they  did , Donald Trump would need to overturn the results of  at least  four different states in order for the election to be decided by Congress  directly . Joe Biden‚Äôs Electoral College victory was sufficient to give him a reasonable cushion, so even losing one or two states  would not change the outcome , and frankly, even that‚Äôs unlikely to happen. Thus, knowing this, McConnell is trying to ensure that there‚Äôs a consensus on January 6th. Donald Trump is not going to be President, no matter how much undemocratic action he tries to take, and the Electoral College has formally determined that Joe Biden is the President-Elect, and with those votes recognised by Congress (again, there‚Äôs next to no chance that they‚Äôll be overturned), he will be sworn in on January 20th. Trump has had plenty of long-shot attempts to change the outcome of the election. His campaign‚Äôs numerous court battles were dismissed in humiliating fashion, and the Supreme Court  unanimously  dismissed two separate challenges, clearing the way for the Electoral College to perform their Constitutional duty, and confirm Joe Biden as President. Put bluntly:  Trump has no further rolls of the dice . There‚Äôs no legal mechanism by which he can become President now. McConnell recognises the futility of trying to continue to back Trump‚Äôs efforts, and knows that he has to focus the Republican Party a) upon governing as the majority party in the Senate (depending on the Georgia elections) and minority party in the House. The Presidency is lost to the GOP until at least 2024: so McConnell now has to prioritise Congress. If the Republicans attempt a long-shot soft coup in Congress, that‚Äôs going to a) result in a backlash against the GOP in the long-term, which might end up as a negative during the 2022 midterm elections, and b) would paint the party in even more of an undemocratic light than before. And why? To salve the ego of a narcissist who now can  without doubt  no longer be re-elected to the Presidency? Trump may retain support among the Republican base, but for McConnell‚Äôs purposes, he‚Äôs a political non-entity as of January 20th. He doesn‚Äôt have any political authority, and any ability to do much of  anything  in Washington after Biden‚Äôs inauguration. Trump had his chance to retain the Presidency  and failed the Republican Party in this regard . Now that the Electoral College have spoken, McConnell knows that Trump is on borrowed time, and he needs to focus on a Republican Party that exists  after Trump has gone . Continuing the support of the tinfoil hat brigade  doesn‚Äôt give the GOP any form of credibility , and while they might not like the rest,  they now have no choice but to accept it, or attempt to secede from the United States . McConnell isn‚Äôt going to take that risk, so Joe Biden will be President, and the Republican Party should just acknowledge that and move  forward , rather than trying to ice skate uphill.",https://www.quora.com/Mitch-McConnell-is-urging-Senate-Republicans-to-not-agree-with-any-electoral-vote-challenges-How-do-you-feel-about-this,"‚ÄúMore to the point, even if they did, Donald Trump would need to overturn the results of at least four different states in order for the election to be decided by Congress directly.‚Äù Actually, no.

Fashion 2022,Will Xi Jinping follow convention and step down in 2022?,"Will Xi Jinping follow convention and step down in 2022? Xi‚Äôs landslide: A provincial shuffle shows the power of China‚Äôs president | The Economist A2A. I had to stare at this question for five minutes before I get what it‚Äôs all about. From The Economist. Hmm. To answer the question: No, it‚Äôs not the ‚Äòconvention‚Äô. It‚Äôs the Constitution.  http://en.people.cn/constitution/constitution.html . Article 79. The term of office of the President and Vice-President of the People's Republic of China is the same as that of the National People's Congress, and  they shall serve no more than two consecutive terms. It‚Äôs been there, embossed in the Chinese Constitution, since 1982. So yes, Xi will step down. And most of the content of The Economist‚Äôs article is illogical in a familiar fashion. I mean, you can‚Äôt build somebody (like Xi) up as the next dictator with the power to arbitrarily bestow permanent power on himself, and then describe how ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt appoint some of his allies to key positions‚Äù because of ‚Äòfactional fight‚Äô. I mean, which one of Mr. Trump‚Äôs blatantly incompetent appointees failed to be confirmed? And the US is a ‚Äúleading democracy‚Äù. So Mr. Trump can appoint a bunch of guys with neither experience nor intelligence and be a ‚Äòbeacon of democracy‚Äô, and Mr. Xi can‚Äôt get his highly competent allies appointed and he‚Äôs the f*cking dictator. Does this make any sense to you? The fact is, China is actually much more authentic about their leadership criteria than you think. They have to. The whole system is dependent on promotion from within, so if they don‚Äôt clearly state what they are looking for, how can they incentivize the 80 million CCP members to work hard for it? That‚Äôs like setting up an Olympic but don‚Äôt tell you what sport it‚Äôs going to be. It doesn‚Äôt make sense, and it doesn‚Äôt work. Instead, the CCP publishes guidelines and articles on promotion criteria all the time, like once a month, on various government levels, to get everybody motivated to work. There are periodic articles on People Daily, explaining ‚Äúwhy these three people are appointed to these three positions, and this is how the criteria works.‚Äù The criteria to get to the top national level is very clear and well-known: you have to have exactly the kind of experience solving the biggest problems China is facing, you have to have recognized technical expertise backed with many years of experience; you have to have volunteered to go to the poorest places and worked there for a number of years, and understand that the poorest people are your people too. That‚Äôs about it. Political factions are real but transient in nature, and very much suppressed by the Party, so if you say openly ‚Äúi support faction A‚Äù, you‚Äôll be immediately expelled. The Economist always puzzles me, as much as the traditional British food. It‚Äôs like you have good quality ingredient, so good that I can just eat them raw with relish. But once you cook them together, well, I‚Äôd rather go out chew on the grass! The Economist is often the same way, until I realized what the magazine was for. The Chinese tend to view the Economist as anti-China. Well, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs got nothing to do with China, except occasionally being used as a prop. The primary intent of this setup is to persuade their own middle-class people to voluntarily line up against the wall and be shot at, economically-speaking. So they‚Äôll put out some ridiculous stories like ‚ÄúXi won‚Äôt step down after 2022‚Äù without mentioning that this would involve trashing the Chinese Constitution, when the real point is that the Brits won‚Äôt cull their ruling class as much as the Chinese, so you end up with somebody like Blair who can still play a role after the War in Iraq, Cameron with about as much intelligence as a high-schooler, and May less competent than an Amoeba. Almost all Anglosphere are led by people who are better suited to star in Daily Soap than in any real job. Fat and stupid. Competition is good for the ordinary people, but not for the elite. In the meantime, the Chinese actually have real competition, and they will ‚Äúcull the herd‚Äù by the hundreds and thousands at a time. The officials will get death sentence for major corruption, go to prison for 20 years over industrial accidents, 5 years for derelict of duty, and be fired for trying to play safe and do nothing. Surprise, surprise! Real competition really does generate stronger animals! But no, let‚Äôs not think about how the heck did the Brits end up with such an outstanding group of losers, and the said losers will never die politically but will go on and on and on, no matter what!

Tricking,What are some tricks to improve my concentration skills?,"How to Concentrate on Studies - Think that you can score the highest and you can do it . Leave everything and just look at your book. Don't just cram it. You should also understand it. Persistence  (keeping on it) is the secret in medium, longer term goals, get some talent (pursue what you want to become good at a higher level: start to do develop your  ability ; desire it and follow through to shape your talent/or skill). It helps to think about what you'll be doing, if you flunk and get an ""F"" or under 35 marks. Think about this and it will compel (or ""entice"") you to do better. Alternate nipping, snipping bits of fruit or snapping off bits of food; a sip of chilled juice (from a spill proof container/sealed thermos), beef jerky and water, to kill hunger, etc. -- to help you stay alert/awake, satiated, but wanting more. Set periodic goals and work them through. Always remember: ""What you believe, you can achieve."" Your dreams (or hopes) can come true by setting goals and achieving your ""hopes"" step-by-step (college, career, family). Daydream about your possible futures! Think about that you will go for the [other] good things after you have completed your main goals, postponing short term goals of self-gratification to make the time for realizing your longer term, bigger goals (dreams/and schemes of you better/best life). Highlight important words and sentences and review them over and over again to make them stick in your mind. Close your books and say it aloud or write it down. Make tasks for each day to see that you complete your work in your given period of time. Figure out your study habits, such as re-reading previous notes or pages in a textbook. Some college libraries make the employee snack area open to students during finals and even stay open extra hours/all night. Make sure that the room you're studying in has bright lights so it helps your eyes to focus. Keep a goal or a challenge you want to achieve. This will help you to concentrate and work hard to achieve that goal. Say to yourself, ""Right, I'm going to ignore my phone/ computer and study for 30 minutes then I'll go on my phone for 10 and study some more."" Giving yourself a realistic good study period and allowing yourself a break in between. Don't just read something over and over. Read it slowly enough to think about and explain to yourself its deeper meaning. Try to express what it really means--if you ""get it""--and remember its meaning. If you can't summarize what you have just read, it probably means you did not get it very well; so, read it a second time, and accept the puzzle of each sentence. Bounce about in the maze of the idea. Then say in your own words what that concept means to you, either in your mind or voice it quietly, if it helps you to concentrate. Summarizing and rewording ideas forces you to react and challenge the topic. Have a cool shower before studying because it makes you relaxed and fresh. Try making memory maps. You can also use paper marks and colourful highlighters to make your studies more interesting. If you can not concentrate at home, go to a library. If you cannot concentrate on your studies at home, the best place is the library. People always go there to study, so it will obviously be quiet! Make a timetable for each subject. Often, some subjects are larger than others, so give more time for those. Easy subjects should have less time.

Tricking,What are some tips and trick of Android that most people don't know about?,"There are lots of tricks and hacks that are commonly known by  Android  users. But there are some hidden tricks that most of the people don‚Äôt know.  However , these days because of the customers are  very cautious  they can find the solution themselves.

A lad who bought a second hand  Android  device ( Samsung Galaxy J2 ) and formatted it. But was unable to use that device. He came to me and request me to fix the problem. I tried hard but all in vain. Then I searched on internet a got a solution. There is a way called bypassing. I used that  .apk  app called  ByPass  and fixed the problem. You Need: You need  (i) A   memory stick  ( memory card ) or a  pen drive , (ii)  An   OTG   cable  ( On The Go cable ) and  (iii) ByPass app .  How To: Download the  ByPass  app from  google play  or from any where. Copy it on memory card or on  pen drive .  Turn off  the  Android  device you want to clear the user data. Then  turn it on .

Ibanez Series S,Are there any guitar effect pedals/units that could help me get somewhere close to the tone from Iron Maiden's Somewhere In Time album? I know what I'm asking so don't chide me as I know I can't recreate the exact sound.. Any help is appreciated ," The set-up for their early albums was actually quite simple. Each of them (Dave Murray and Adrain Smith) used four of those 1978 to 1981 era non-master volume 50-watt Marshall JMP 1987 Mk II Super Lead amp heads running into two pairs of full stacks of 4x12‚Ä≥ Marshall cabs. One pair was loaded with late 70‚Äôs era 200-watt Electro-Voice EVM12L Series II speakers (they were the first lead type EVM speakers) and other pair was loaded with those late 70‚Äôs era aluminum domed JBL K120 speakers. As for effect pedals, they weren't that fancy too: Dave Murray:
 Depending on the song he used to boost the amp with either a MXR 10 band EQ, Boss FET FA 1 Preamp, or the old script logo MXR Distortion + pedal. Sometimes he even combined them.
Other than them he used one of those Yamaha AD10 analog delay pedal, the old script logo MXR Phase 90, DOD Flanger 670, Dunlop Crybaby wah.
Starting from the World Slavery Tour he also started using a Aria ACH-1 Chorus. Adrian Smith:
 Depending on the song he either used a MXR Micro Amp with treble bleed mod or a Ibanez TS808 to boost his amps.
Rest of his pedals were similar to Dave, he too used a Dunlop Crybaby, Yamaha AD10 analog delay. Other than them he used Yamaha PH01 phaser, Yamaha FL10M flanger.
Starting from World Slavery Tour he later replaced the Yamaha AD10 with a Boss DD2 and also started using a Boss RV-2 reverb and Boss CE3 chorus pedal. Both of them used Pete Cornish 4-way signal splitter to split their guitar signal between their four amps. Pete Cornish also made them a pedalboard which facilitated fast and easy switching between the effect pedals. That pedalboard was the precursor of modern day programmable effect pedal switchers. Starting from late 80‚Äôs by the time when Adrian Smith left the band most of those effect pedals were replaced by rack-mount effect units.
In the No Prayer On The Road tour while Dave used his JMPs, Janick Gers used his JCM800 amps running into Marshall 4x12‚Ä≥ cabs loaded with Marshall G12 Vintage speakers. However by mid 90‚Äôs those amps were replaced by JMP-1 rack-mount preamps and Marshall 9200 rack mount power-amps. They switched to a fully rack-mount rig. The signal routing between those rack-mount preamps and effects is handled by a custom built rack-mount signal router made by Pete Cornish. Long story in short they used whatever effects available to them to achieve their guitar tones. The only thing that remained common for them was that they used Marshall amps. Those pedals they used till the Somewhere In Time tour can be replaced with pretty much any similar pedals. None of them were some sort of unobtanium pedals.
As for the effect pedal switcher made by Pete Cornish, pretty much any programmable loop switcher can do that nowadays. Back then it was difficult to do but nowadays many pedal manufacturers make programmable loop switchers which can do a lot more stuffs then just switching pedals.
As of the speaker choices for those early albums, well you can compensate for it with right settings. Truth be told many modern hot-rodded Marshall amps are so bright that they will sound absolutely strident through those JBL K120 speakers. At the end of the day all that matters is how you play. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to clone their rig to sound like them.
Forget Marshall DSL even a Jet City Amplification JCA running through Eminence V12 speakers can easily pull off Iron Maiden style guitar tones if you set it right. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to get a Marshall.
Just get something like a Boss SD-1, mid-boost your amp with it. Play around with the settings on your delay pedal and the plate reverb setting of your reverb pedal and you‚Äôll be good to go.",https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-guitar-effect-pedals-units-that-could-help-me-get-somewhere-close-to-the-tone-from-Iron-Maidens-Somewhere-In-Time-album-I-know-what-Im-asking-so-dont-chide-me-as-I-know-I-cant-recreate-the-exact-sound,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Do students need homework?,"Practice. Practice makes perfect. If you‚Äôve ever started something new, some new skill, and i‚Äôm guessing you probably have, then I‚Äôm sure you realize that you weren‚Äôt fantastic in the beginning. Think about an instrument, let‚Äôs say a guitar.  But not just any guitar, an Ibanez S series, because that‚Äôs one hell of a guitar! Anyways, when you first pick up the guitar chances are you‚Äôre not going to be  Yngwie Malmsteen  incarnate, you‚Äôre going to have something I call stupid fingers; lack of coordination between your eye, fretting fingers and strumming hand to produce and meaningful notes. Now instead of despairing, you practice. Maybe 20 minutes a day at first. Then an hour. Then you start learning whole songs after a few months. And after a year or two of practicing for an hour or more a day you‚Äôve learnt a bunch of songs, musical scales and are even comfortable generating so original music. And to think just a year ago all you could do was slap the strings with your hand because you couldn't even hold a pick correctly! The point of all that was all the stuff that‚Äôs being taught in school is a lot like that guitar; it‚Äôs hard, seems stupid to learn, and all these feeling are compounded not being good at it. The first few weeks when you started playing that guitar was not fun, in fact it was probably incredibly frustrating and most of the time you would just want to give up. But after just a year you can play enough to impress most people, and it‚Äôs really fun now! Mathematics, Languages, Essays for English(Or whatever variation) class, etc. are all skills that require practice to hone. The homework is that practice, guided practice which is meant to get the ideas instilled in your head, and contrary to what a lot of people say about the education system,  all of the stuff you learn in school is absolutely important.  Maybe not every little detail but overall, yes it is.  To become good at something you need to practice, and homework is practice through repetition, which is itself one of the best ways to learn something . So you‚Äôre question was, ‚ÄúWhy the hell do we have to do homework?‚Äù. Well You really don‚Äôt have to do the homework to pass in all actuality, I rarely did mine in high school. But if you want to actually learn the material then yes, you have to do your homework.",https://www.quora.com/Do-students-need-homework,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Are expensive guitars worth it?,"I agree with many answers on here. As far as acoustics go, more expensive is going to go further in that world, but still, you can find great acoustics for a decent price, but its really hard to beat a good Taylor or something of that caliber. I am an electric player, mainly blues rock, but love metal too. I have owned $2,500+ guitars. Still, my favorite is my $600 Ibanez S series with a ZR tremolo system. And I spent another $200 to have my favorite Dimarzio pickups installed in it. This guitar plays like a dream-just as good as a Satriani or my old Petrucci signature JP6. It‚Äôs nice to own a signature electric, but if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for, just find one that has the features and playability you love, then build on it and make it your own. Just don't try to change out trem systems and such unless you‚Äôre experienced in the install or are willing to pay a professional to do so. I‚Äôve built my own guitars from base models and love them all the more because I‚Äôve made them my own, unique to me. But really, a good guitarist can make a bare bones guitar sound great.

Pepe the frog,Which nation is most in need of a new flag?,"New Zealand If you don‚Äôt know, we held a flag referendum to change our flag. Thousands of designs were pitched, and we finally chose one.  We spent $27 million, and end up choosing to keep the same flag? This is worse than the time one of our politicians had a dildo thrown at them. But in all seriousness, we needed a new flag. Why else would we have the referendum? We were sick of being confused with Australia‚Äôs flag, and the Union Jack was an outdated thing to put on the flag of a country which isn‚Äôt under colonial rule anymore. Most New Zealanders agreed: ‚ÄúSure, change the flag. Just not to that one.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat one‚Äù referred to the final flag in the referendum. We as a country would vote to keep our existing flag, or change it to this.  It‚Äôs awful. Absolutely frickin‚Äô awful. We needed a flag change. But we failed. Last note: There were some godly flags we needed.  Pepe the frog. Can‚Äôt go any better than that.  Oh wait. Laser shooting kiwis. Never mind. But the greatest flag?  God bless New Zealand.

But I think a flag with a kiwi bird would have been the best. Everybody would recognize this flag, just everybody in the world.",I think the proposed flag (silver fern on black background combined with red stars in the blue background) is unique and beautiful. The blue should be darker though (similar to the current flag).,"Personally I think the entire process shows that New Zealand neither needs nor wants a new flag. Polls before the process was started showed that only about 1 in 4 people were at all interested in going ahead with the process. $27 million thrown away. Yes, it's similar to the Aussie flag but, so what? It's meant to be. ‚ÄòWe‚Äô are sick of our flag being confused with the Aussie flag? Who is this 'We'? The Union Jack is symbolic of our strong historic and cultural ties with Britain. Nothing wrong with that. I can see nothing to be gained by changing whereas a great many people would be deeply hurt by having change forced upon them.","Could not agree more with this answer. The Laser Kiwi would have won by a landslide, just like how Bernie Sanders would‚Äôve bet Trump in the US election if he was in it instead of Hillary Clinton. And the last flag is so true, there‚Äôs nearly more Chinese than Maori and will be in the next few years.","I tell yas, if one of the options had been the very standard white fern, black background, nothing else; we wouldn‚Äôt have needed any other entries, or a referendum.

Tricking,Mentalism:  What are the most amazing mind reading tricks of all time?,"I think the Gold Standard for mind reading effects would have to be Bob Cassidy's ""Fourth Dimensional Telepathy."" Three spectators are given cards upon which to write various thoughts. The spectators THEMSELVES place them into small envelopes and seal them shut. Nevertheless, with no questions asked, the mentalist is able to tell each spectator what they wrote. It is a seamless, beautiful piece of work. Cassidy also has a card effect -- I don't know the name of it -- that is similarly inexplicable. In short: the mentalist writes down a prediction ahead of time. This is given to a spectator to hold or placed somewhere where it is absolutely unquestionable that the mentalist cannot get to it to change it. The mentalist then introduces a full deck of cards, and divides it into two halves. At the audience's direction, he throws one of the halves away. He then shuffles the remaining cards and divides them into two packets; again, at the audience's SPECIFIC direction, he throws one of the packets away. He continues to do this several times until he's left with a very small packet of cards (which he then shows to be all mixed up). He turns them face-down and slowly deals one card at a time from top to bottom. At any point, a spectator tells him to stop at a specific card, and the spectator looks at that card. (All the other cards are shown to be different, of course.) And sure enough, that one card matches the mentalist's earlier prediction. It is a thing of beauty to behold. There is absolutely no explanation other than that the mentalist correctly predicted the outcome, 1 out of 52, ahead of time.
 I think the ""blindfold drive"" is also a stunning piece of mentalism when done correctly. All sorts of things -- balls of dough, topped with big coins, held in place by big bandaids, wrapped in ace bandages, and topped with a blindfold (for instance) -- are placed over the mentalist's eyes, and then a sack placed over the head just for good measure. Then the mentalist gets behind the wheel of a car and drives it perfectly, through traffic, on highways, etc. At the end, each of those solid, examinable impediments are removed from the mentalist's head and eyes.  There are many more. I could talk about Sefalaljia, for instance, the marvelous mysterious box that acts as if there are spirits inside, creating impossible effects one after the other, being shown entirely empty every time. That is another favorite.",https://www.quora.com/Mentalism-What-are-the-most-amazing-mind-reading-tricks-of-all-time,The card effect  sounds like the magicians force unless he is asking specifically which packet to throw away and not just to pick a packet.,"Joshua- Thank you for the kind words.;My version of fourth dimensional telepaty is my favorite creation. It took me over a decade to perfect the handling, but the result is actually almost a complete act that looks exactly like real mind reading. Thankfully it isn't easy to do well, so not many mentalists actually perform it exactly as taught. Instead, the frequently eliminate the ""convincers"" that make the effect seem so impossible. The card effect you referred to is called ""The Protean Eye."" And you are correct- all of the choices are completely free. Any audience member can tell me whether to toss a packet away or keep it. The final selection is also a completely free choice.I designed the effect specifically to baffle the wise guys anxious to explain the magicians choice to whomever is sitting next to them. You got the prediction part a bit wrong though. I write the prediction on a large clip board and actually SHOW it to half of the audience before I begin the routine. After each selection I show the remaining cards to that half of the audience so they may verify that the predicted card is still there. The rest of the audience doesn't see the prediction until the end of the effect.",,,
Tricking,"What are your favorite automation tricks (browser tricks, email tricks, social media tricks, etc.) personally and at work?","Email allocation trick for better prioritization: The best way that works for me is the following system of email rules: Start Easy - Create rules to  move system notifications , internal general notifications to designated folders. (there were already 40 messages in the designated folders after 50 minutes - this alone saved precious time) Continue Medium - Create  rules for incoming messages per team mates, management . Have separate folders created to each person and create rules for each person. Once they send an email, it will be automatically moved to their folder. What is the use of this? You can know straight away and don't need to search for your boss's emails and can react, take action immediately. Get advanced - Create a CC folder, and create the rule to  move each email to this folder in which you are in the 'cc' field  only. Why? Most of these emails are only FYI, but can very quickly cause Inbox meltdown. If an email should have been actioned by you, it will come back again with your name in the 'to' field anyway; or you will receive a meeting invite or call. Get hardcore - Go to your Inbox; click on the 'Unread' emails; select the 'From' option for sorting; collapse the rows; and drag the from column wide to the right.

Tricking,What is your little known investing trick that you are willing to share for free?,"I am a trained fundamental and technical analyst of stocks, And I have been experimenting with different Investment techniques in Indian stock market for a while now. The techniques mentioned below are so simple that it may seem too good to be true, but believe me they have given higher returns than some of my thoroughly analysed and bought shares. STOP hunting for multibaggers in penny/cheaper stocks, Instead invest in well known large companies, even if their price seems higher. Observe around you and see which companies come up with new and innovative products that you or your family and friends use often, Shortlist 3 to 5 such companies from different sectors. Try to stay away from commodities such as gold, silver etc., If you have two companies identified from the same sector, go with the one with lower PE and lower PEG ratios. Don‚Äôt be worried if the share price when you buy are around it‚Äôs 52 week high or low, over long term this doesn‚Äôt matter much. Invest sizeable amount in each of the identified companies Have 10% to 20% of your entire portfolio value in your trading account, to top up your investments, when the prices fall. Then you start monitoring them regularly for the price fluctuations, and follow the below strategy: If you observe the stock price start falling due to some bad news or global or local incidents, don‚Äôt panic and sell off. Wait until the price fall settles down, and top up your investment in that company, make sure the price drop is at least 10% from its previous high or your purchase price. If the price drops agian, make sure the price drop is at least 10% from its previous high or your last purchase price to buy more shares. Every quarter, see if the sales and revenues are going higher for all the invested companies. They need not go high considerably, they may even be range bound for few quarters, in such case you need not worry. However, if you see constant decline in sales and revenue for last 4 or more quarters, check if the company fundamentals are in tact( new product line, debt, promoters holding, etc.). If not, exit before the prices plummet. But this is very very rare for a well known large Cap, but you have to have an exit strategy to cut your losses. Don‚Äôt get into Stock market investment for quick money. Never invest the money which is meant for something very important such as education, marriage, medical purposes in hope of a quick buck. To see the power of compounding, one has to stay invested for a very long period (10+ years at least). Buy more shares from the same 3 to 5 Shortlisted companies, from all the dividends that are paid out.

Tricking,What are some useful psychological hacks for a successful interview?,"I've not attended many interviews. But here are few things which we can keep in mind : Interview is a process of selection, not elimination. So the chances are, the interviewer is trying to make the most of his / her time by selecting you if you match at least 50% of their expectation. Try to look cool and composed even when it's not going well. This will make them feel that may be you are doing bad because this is not your area of expertise. Remember that in most cases your strong points or area of expertise will not be their comfort zone. While you are being questioned, try to be proactive. This will create a comfortable atmosphere. Acknowledge openly if you can't answer a question and try to enquire about it's answer. Being interested will show that you are open for learning. If given a chance, be inquisitive about their organization and nature of work. There's a thin line between being convincing and being argumentative. Don't cross it.

Tricking,What are some cool C++ tricks?,"This post is mainly for tricks regarding  Competitive coding  which can improve the efficiency of your code. No need to use % for checking if the number is even or odd. Just use &(bitwise operator). This is efficient with large numbers, otherwise for small numbers % is better. if (x & 1)     cout<<""Odd""; else    cout <<""Even""; What happens here is- Suppose x=5. Converting it to binary, we have ‚Äú101‚Äù. So 101 & 1, so it will be 001. Want to do fast multiplication or division with 2? Use binary shifting. x=x<<1; // Multiplication with 2 x=x>>1; // Divide by 2 Here we are using the left shift and right shift operators. Swap numbers using XOR. This method is more efficient and also doesn‚Äôt require a third variable x^=y y^=x x^=y Use  emplace_back()  instead of  push_back()  because it is much faster and efficient Create  inline  functions and use them during contests such that you don‚Äôt have to code again. Example- Function of sieve You know that the maximum size of array inside main function is 10^6 right? But if you declare it globally, you can even declare it upto 10^7. You can calculate the most significant digit by using this:  N is the number double x= log10(N); x= floor(x); So now, x is the most significant digit. Calculate number of digits without loop and this is more efficient that the traditional one. N is the number Number of digits= floor(log10(N))+1; Check if a number is power of 2 efficiently. bool powertwo (int x){   return x&& (!(x&(x-1))); } Complexity of this is- O (no of digits of number in binary form) instead of the normal technique which has O(logN) Want to copy elements of an array to another array without running a loop? See below. int x[3]={1,2,3}; int y[3]; copy_n(x,3,y); Want to initialize an array from a value you want and increment? Use the IOTA Algorithm. int x[3]={1,2,3}; iota (x,x+3,5};  // {5,6,7}  char y[3]={0}; iota(y,y+3,'a'); //{'a','b','c'}; Use C++ STL for binary search binary_search (start,end,valuetofind) This all might be helpful. Your little appreciation will help me to write more. Thank you Koulick Sadhu",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cool-C++-tricks,"Ahh, interesting. Write more about programming brother. You may write more answers on competitive programming.",Does binary shifting work for negative numbers?,"Excellent tricks. But one thing I would like to add is that when you are swapping two variables without using third variables, it is using exor operation which doesn't work in one case i.e when two numbers to swap are same. Ex a= 3,b=3 then at the end a=0 and b=0","Your 1st, 2nd & 3rd point are factually incorrect. There is no speedboost gained from this. At O2 optimization level (which is standard for CP) the compiler optimizes it anyway. Also, your writing inline infront of a function doesn't practically affect performance. The compiler almost always ignores your request for inlining and decides the best on its own. Number of digits in binary form and log N are the same.",Well that's wondrous! Such kinda answers motivate me to use C++ over any other language.
Tricking,Can you teach me a weird psychology trick?,"1. Allowing the opponent to refuse will make it more difficult for the opponent to refuse.  People instinctively resist constraints, but when he feels that he is free to choose, it is easier to listen to the other's suggestions.
So, next time you ask someone else, you might as well say ""if you are inconvenient, you can refuse."" You might have unexpected gains like this! 2. When you feel nervous, chewing can relax the brain's vigilant response to the surroundings.  Preliminary EEG studies have shown that chewing can affect brain activity by enhancing the response of arousal mechanisms. Chewing can reduce stress, eliminate tension, improve concentration and memory, and improve people's performance in certain cognitive tasks. 3. People are more likely to spend money when they are hungry.  Researchers have found that people secrete a kind of ""hunger hormone"" when they are hungry. This hormone can increase our attention to food and at the same time exert an influence on the brain, making us very craving for the food on the shelf. This hormone will make people think that food is more attractive, while also becoming more generous when buying other goods. 4. ""Unhappy, when you wake up from sleep, you will feel refreshed?""-The opposite is true.  When many people encounter unhappiness in real life, their friends will comfort you: ""It's okay, go to sleep and when you wake up, you will forget everything."" However, psychological research results show that: Sleep will not make you forget the unhappy things, but it will make you remember the unhappy things deeper, because when people are in deep sleep, they will convert short-term memories into long-term memories. So if you have something unhappy, you must solve it before going to bed! 5. You in your imagination are 30% more beautiful than you in reality.  Psychological research has found that when people look in the mirror, their brains automatically beautify themselves. You in the mirror look 30% better than you really are. In other words, your true appearance is actually about 30% uglier than you feel. This is why many people feel that the self in the photo is different from what they think.",https://www.quora.com/Can-you-teach-me-a-weird-psychology-trick,"These are interesting and I know the first two are true. The last one about the mirror may be true for some or even most but body dysmorphia is quite common (I have it - I see myself as skinnier than I am, like unhealthy skinny as I‚Äôve had self confidence issues around this from my childhood) so I‚Äôm curious as to what percentage see them as hotter and who sees themselves as uglier - presumably because it‚Äôs a scale some must see themselves accurately?",The reason people feel that a photo is different from what they think is because they are used to seeing themselves in a mirror. Things in a photo are reversed from what they see in a mirror. Also you never really see your hair quite the way a photo shows it.,So I'm more uglier than I see myself. Another reason why I hate my life.,,
Tricking,What is the kernel trick?,"Let us start by understanding what kernel is. If you read  Nikhil Garg's answer to What are kernels in machine learning and SVM and why do we need them? , you'd understand that kernel is essentially a mapping function - one that transforms a given space into some other (usually very high dimensional) space.  As it turns out, while solving the SVM, we only need to know the inner product of vectors in the coordinate space. Say, we choose a kernel  K  and  P1  and  P2   are two points in the original space.  K  would map these points to  K(P1)  and  K(P2)  in the transformed space. To find the solution using SVMs, we only need to compute inner product of the transformed points  K(P1)  and  K(P2) . If we denote  S  as the similarity function in transformed space (as expressed in the terms of the original space), then: S(P1, P2)  =  <K(P1), K(P2)>   The Kernel trick essentially is to define  S  in terms of original space itself without even defining (or in fact, even knowing), what the transformation function  K  is.
Let me illustrate by an example. Say the original space is 2 dimensional cartesian space. Say we define the similarity function as follows:  S( P(x_1, y_1), P(x_2, y_2))  =  x_1^2x_2^2 + y_1^2y_2^2 + 2x_1y_1*x_2y_2   and then solve the SVM problem. We've, without even realizing, projected our points in a higher dimensional space (in this case 3 dimensional) and then taken the usual inner product in that space. Let's try to see what the kernel function  K  was in this case. x_1^2x_2^2 + y_1^2y_2^2 + 2x_1y_1*x_2y_2
=  <(x_1^2, y_1^2, \sqrt2 x_1y_1), (x_2^2, y_2^2, \sqrt2 x_2y_2)> So  K(x, y) = (x^2, y^2, \sqrt2 xy)    So why is it useful? Why is it even called a trick? For a kernel to be useful, it'd typically need to have a large number of dimensions (in most popular kernels, even infinite). But transforming input data into such large dimensional space can take a lot of computation power. This is where Kernel trick comes into picture - we can choose a kernel[1] where the transformed space is of high dimension and yet it is easy to compute the similarity score in the original space.  For example, if we define our similarity function as: S(P1, P2)  =  e^{-||P1 - P2||}   Kernel function is infinite dimensional space but still similarity is easy to compute.  Also just so you know, most people use  K  for denoting similarity function instead of  S  because it clarifies that similarity is in transformed space even though it is expressed in terms of the original space. Also thanks to kernel trick we don't need to talk about transformation function any more, and so  K  is free for us to use.

[1] As you can guess now, we go the other way around - we choose a similarity function and hope that it represents a transformation where data is separable. Also, there are some constraints on the similarity function  K for this trick to work. Though knowing them isn't crucial for understanding what the trick really is.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-kernel-trick,One thing I don't understand is how did you even find this similarity function? Can you explain with some other not very intuitive similarity function?,Reposted your answer here  What is the greatest trick in mathematics?,"One thing I still need to understand about the kernel trick is how it works for symbolic objects. It seem that the kernel trick removes the need for using features in your svm, and lets you just supply a 'similarity function'..","You are wrong. Your function K is not the kernel. It is the feature map. The kernel, whose the real name is the  reproducing kernel  associated to a  reproducing kernel Hilbert space H , is your function  S  that we usually call the  similarity function . The similarity function or kernel uses the definition of  reproducing kernel , of the  Moore‚ÄìAronszajn theorem , and of the mapping between  feature map  and  evaluation function of any function f in an Hilbert space H  noticed  Kx  related to the reproducing kernel  K(x,y) .","in terms of terminology..isnt the similarity measure (what you denote with S) actually the kernel function. and what you define as kernel K, isnt that actually the feature map - often denoted phi? edit: mathjax not working in comments? just removed the dollar signs:P"
Ibanez Series S,"What movie or video game character was the audience supposed to root for, but actually hated?","I‚Äôll list a few, and some of my answers may piss people off, but here we go: Mutt Williams(Henry Jones III)
 Mutt Williams was created to be the replacement of Indiana Jones. Just like his father, as a young man he was rebellious and took the name of a dog as his own given name. People just prefer Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, so yeah.  Jar-Jar Binks
Jar-Jar Binks was created to be the comic relief of the Prequel trilogy. In a weird inversion, on release, he was tolerable, but due to the massive media coverage on how ‚ÄúAwful of a character‚Äù he was, he has since been used as a talking point on how terrible the film was. He was basically made for the kids, and to ease up on the heavy political drama portions of the movie since the film was made as a kid‚Äôs movie first.  Abigail ‚ÄúAbby‚Äù Anderson
 Abby is the 2nd protagonist of The Last of Us Part 2. Her journey mirrors the journey of the previous game‚Äôs protagonist, Joel. In fact, She‚Äôs more or less got the ‚ÄúPhysical‚Äù prowess of Joel while Ellie got his ‚ÄúStealth and Tracking‚Äù. Abby‚Äôs playable parts were tailor made to make the player sympathize with her AND prefer playing as her rather than Ellie. Abby was made to replace Ellie and Joel, but because of no build up, the player is immediately given a reason to hate her, and what makes it funny was that Naughty Dog underestimated just how much players were emotionally latched to Joel. The game also proceeds to tell you ‚ÄúJoel and Ellie are bad people‚Äù, either from characters actively saying it, or Ellie making stupidly selfish decisions. To be fair to Abby, Abby is knocked down multiple notches and has her hypocrisy shoved in to her face multiple times to humble her to the point of not wanting to fight Ellie anymore. Abby‚Äôs story is actually VERY well thought out, but the ‚Äúhate‚Äù on her falls more on the execution of the story rather than on her looks or her personality. You can‚Äôt make a character look good if your story wasn‚Äôt executed well, especially if the characters she was meant to replace had a far better story than hers(note, her ‚Äúi feel bad for Lev and have to be a big sister for him‚Äù is in no way nearly as powerful as Joel‚Äôs survivor‚Äôs guilt and his struggle to not replace his dead daughter with Ellie)  Sam Witwicky
 Sam Witwicky is supposed to be the live action equivalent of Spike Witwicky. Unfortunately, after the first of the Bayformers films, his character just got more and more worse that they eventually just killed him off when it became obvious that people disliked his character. side note: This has nothing to do with the actor seeing as this is the 2nd time he‚Äôs appeared.  ROBOCOP(2014)
 He‚Äôs Robocop! He‚Äôs supposed to be liked, but because of being the reboot version of him, people didn‚Äôt like him. His new design sucked, and you only see him don the classic look briefly at 2 separate sections of the film. This is more of audiences hating the film rather than the character, but people still hated on the character. They ditched Robocop‚Äôs goofy dad jokey personality(his 1987 self was a font of goofiness and dad jokes) and the satirical Jesus symbolism of Robocop(the character) for a more bland interpretation of the character.  (Left: what we wanted| Right: What we got) Guile(Street Fighter the Motion Picture)
Guile is the protagonist of the film. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs even more of a caricature of the character given the really bad miscast of the heavily accented Jean Claude VanDamme as an American. But, it‚Äôs not his fault, you see, when Raul Julia gave such a great performance as the villain, that his performance was the basis used for the character in the games going forward, Guile just seems bad. Guile was nothing compared to Julia‚Äôs M.Bison, and that‚Äôs why fans ‚Äúhated‚Äù Guile.  (You can see him struggling to be understood, but he was probably high) Trace(Pokemon LGE/LGP)
 Trace is the rival that replaces Blue/Gary in the the Gen 1‚Ä≥remake‚Äù of Pokemon. He was made to ease new players in by being easy. He‚Äôs a joke of a rival, and most of the trainers you meet in Victory Road are harder than his final fight against him. He was given a ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù personality to welcome players, but players preferred the asshole Gen 1 Rival, Gary, over him.  John Connor(Post T2)
 John Connor was the literal ‚ÄúChosen One‚Äù of the Terminator franchise. But, since T2:Judgement Day was released, he went from someone you want to root for to someone fans hated because of what was done to his character. After T2, he grew up to be a paranoid drug addicted hobo in T3. In Terminator Salvation, he was an unlikeable asshole, a far cry from the messianic figure he was prophesized to be in Terminator 1. In Terminator Gensys, they turned him into the villain. Then they just killed him off in the reboot. So yeah. The character was made to be the one you rooted for, and ended up being the one fans hated, because movie magic.  (The Terminated, The Druggie, The Asshole, and The Badman. All the same guy) Zilla(Godzilla 1998)
 Zilla was made to be Godzilla. And you know how fans of the Kaiju would want to root for him. The marketing of the film really didn‚Äôt help but hype him up. But Zilla was such a bad design that not only did the fans hate him, the  IP OWNERS HATED HIM . The hate was so big that they dedicated a 7 second cameo of the monster in Godzilla Final Wars, just to show the Toho Godzilla killing it in under 7 seconds. Not much can be said about a movie character when even the IP Owners hated him.  (took the ‚ÄúGod‚Äù out of Godzilla) Steve Burnside
 Steve Burnside was Claire Redfield‚Äôs ally and potential love interest in Resident Evil Code Veronica. He was designed specifically to appeal to the female fanbase in RE, from his looks being based off of a well known Teen Heartthrob of the time, to his clothes being design after what was ‚Äúin‚Äù in Japan among youths. But his character and voice acting was so annoying that he is barely edged out of ‚Äúmost annoying character in RE‚Äù by RE4‚Äôs Ashley Graham.  (yeaaah, a lawsuit waiting to happen. it‚Äôs why they redesigned him in later releases) Johnny Rico & Carmen Ibanez(Starship Troopers)
 These 2 are supposed to be the protagonists alongside their friend ‚ÄúNaz! Neil Patrick Harris‚Äù. They‚Äôre also the ‚Äúpairing/ship‚Äù we‚Äôre supposed to root for. Unfortunately for us, the 2 of them are such horrible people that it‚Äôs hard to like them, especially since their significant others(after the 2 initially broke up at the start of the film) were so much better people than them(and for them), that its not even funny. Rico does eventually get better in later films, but in the 1st film? yeah, terrible guy, even for a satire like this film.  (terrible people that are hard to root for) Liv Hawthorne(Willy‚Äôs Wonderland)
 The movie basically sets it up so you‚Äôd root for the Janitor(aka Mute Nicolas Cage), Liv and her friends. You‚Äôre supposed to root for Liv specifically since her backstory said so, but every time she says something, it‚Äôs either stupid or annoying. It‚Äôs so hard to root for her  (every time she opens her mouth to try and add something to the plot, it hurts because of how annoying it is) Raiden(Metal Gear Solid 2)
 Raiden was created only because series creator Hideo Kojima got offended at some teenage Japanese girls complaining about not wanting to play as an old man. But, the fanbase HATED him, not because his character was bad, not because he was a pretty boy, no. They hated him because he replaced Solid Snake. Simple. He has since developed a following after his humorous cameo in MGS3, his edgey return in MGS4, and his over the top awesome solo game in MGRevengance.  Bayonetta(Super Smash Bros 4)
 In a rare turn of events, Bayonetta was a guest character in Smash Bros. But because of how unfair of a fighter she was, people began to hate her. She has been nerfed in Smash Bros Ultimate(note: She‚Äôs well liked in her own game, its just that it‚Äôs hard to root for her given how OP she is in SSB4)  (‚Äú Bayonetta gets BANNED ‚Äù in Smash Tourneys)",https://www.quora.com/What-movie-or-video-game-character-was-the-audience-supposed-to-root-for-but-actually-hated,"This was awesome. I loved this reply; I‚Äôm really happy that you added both Video Game  and  Movie characters. Thanks for the descriptions, too. I loved the historical context.","From what I have heard Roland Emmerich had some weird ideas about Godzilla. Among other things, he basis for the design was that he wanted it to be fast. Because when people think of Godzilla, the first thing that comes to mind is speed. Hating on Jar Jar is something that has gotten old for me, and the fact that his actor nearly committed suicide just makes me cringe. I can‚Äôt help but think of how an innocent man in real life nearly killed himself when I see the character derided. Raiden‚Äôs hate mostly came from American fans because his design is less masculine than Solid Snake. A decent chunk of the flak I saw thrown at him also struck me as homophobic, which from what I have heard, it is homophobic. Thankfully fans warmed up to him. I will admit that I feel Snake was the better lead character, but he was in still in MGS2. But Snake set the bar so high I feel almost anybody would struggle to match it.",,,

Even in the west, though it is forgotten now, it was a symbol of luck and auspiciousness. It has been found by archaeologists around the world, including in Mesopotamia and the Indus valley.

Presidential Election,Does the 2016 U.S. presidential election seem unreal?,"Thanks for the A2A. Absolutely it is an unreal election, and in more ways than one. In fact this might be the first real election, which is what makes it seem so unreal. The key thing that is happening is that all the ‚Äú Unbiased ‚Äù pundits are having their biases exposed. Until now every media agency has been able to be the public‚Äôs view into reality. But those behind the bias had a common chord between them. They had this backroom linkage that insured that all had to co-exist peacefully, with none exposing the underbelly of the beast. Until now the media could, in a day‚Äôs time, destroy anyone‚Äôs reputation.  This ability of the media to totally control the narrative meant that every candidate had to stay within certain bounds. Those bounds were determined whatever the media wanted them to be. Donald Trump was the first candidate who figured out how to use alternative media through his Twitter and Facebook feeds, and to effectively bait the main stream media into showing their bias. This is what has changed the game dramatically. This is why you can have media 24x7 portraying Trump as the worst human being ever, and yet his polls rise or stay steady. It is not that 42% of the population wants to elect Hitler. It‚Äôs that 42% of the population has learned how to see through what the media is doing. So in reality it isn‚Äôt that the election is unreal. It‚Äôs that prior elections were only unreal. They were never real. The media always drove all of the narrative and candidates had to play entirely within their rules, and otherwise ignore reality. Donald Trump has now run a campaign based on reality, real events that occurred, real actions people have taken, real lives that have been affected, real national changes that have occurred over time. That reality campaign is running along side the normal unreal campaign where everything is not about reality, but about looking presidential, about using the nicest words about staying within media approved boundaries, about letting the media decide the narrative. So yes the campaign is unreal. But it‚Äôs always been unreal. What is different is that this is the first time a real campaign has been running alongside the unreal one. That‚Äôs why it seems so odd. It is not odd to those who‚Äôve taken the red pill, who can see the Matrix (metaphorically speaking, of course). There‚Äôs 2 simple worlds. One is the world of Left Wing Hysteria, which the media plays in where every thing they talk about, no matter how small, is a pending crises. Trump's Comments: The Latest Left-Wing Hysteria | RealClearPolitics The other is reality. In reality the 19-trillion-dollar debt is a big deal. The fact that our companies are competing under crippling burdens put there by their own government is a big deal. The fact that murder rates are going up is a big deal. The fact that insurance costs to both the insured and the taxpayer are skyrocketing is a big deal. The media likes the unreal world because they can play with emotions there. 42% of the people have recognized that the real world is what matters. That number will only grow. The question is whether or not there is enough time.",https://www.quora.com/Does-the-2016-U-S-presidential-election-seem-unreal,"I'm struggling with this answer. On the one hand I agree entirely that the media controls the message. There was a point where unbiased media existed. Today it's almost impossible to get information without considering the source, their politics and agenda and who stands to gain. On the other hand I don't see Trump as a hero (accidental or otherwise). He's a dishonest businessman, a total creep to women, a blowheart and an ego maniac. Acting professionally and with good taste does not require that you bow to the media or any other agenda. Their may be correlation in your argument but you didn't prove causation. I do agree the Trump phenomenon has proved something. Sadly I think it's proved that a lot of people are angry, somewhat racist and happy to accept simple answers (that aren't answers at all) to complex problems.

Presidential Election,When is the 2020 presidential election in the US?,"November 3, 2020. The general election for the United States of America always happens on the day after the first Monday in November. Thus, it happens on whatever day of November 2 through 8 is a Tuesday. The major parties will be having statewide primary elections to choose their candidates throughout late winter and spring in 2020, with the candidates formally selected in early summer of 2020. The Republican primaries will probably be pretty boring: one has to be a pretty terrible president to have your party reject you, and Trump is liked by Republicans, especially the sort who come out to vote for primaries. The Democratic primaries will be more interesting because there are lots and lots of candidates, even if there are clearly tiers and lower-tier candidates will start dropping out.",https://www.quora.com/When-is-the-2020-presidential-election-in-the-US,,,,,

Presidential Election,How does the presidential election affect the stock market?,"Jon, I am not a Republican, though it might seem like it if you read my posts, I am presently in favor of the Capitalist Model, having been a socialist, well educated, well traveled and skilled in many things, I concluded socialism is BS. And so, if we like it or not, Capitalist rule us all; I do not like it completely, indeed I have often wondered why, do, not these money men, become more humanitarian?, o.k. a few billionaires give money away, but I mean it in a structured sense. If they did, then I am sure Fascists, Communities, Socialist would become near obsolete, but I am afraid never gone. Do not forget the stock market reflects today, what they expect the future to be, in the here & now, its what people like Trump's advisers put into play, that frees business, for example from all the EPA, actual Law, and Health & Safety over-kill, that Obama herniated business with, almost killing it, and in some places he did that, for good. Trump simply made the conditions right for business, for workers, for bankers lending. You should look up Capital Additions, or try search for my reference to it in Trump‚Äôs manifesto, and run out in his Tax & Jobs plan policy. A master stroke for business & future jobs, Obama & his people never even gave that a thought, because Trump‚Äôs people are light years ahead of Obama‚Äôs. That is why when Obama‚Äôs economy flatlined in July 2016, and after anemic growth averaging under 1%, he cannot lay any claim to Trump‚Äôs economic success, the uptick went vertical, as soon as Trump won.

Presidential Election,What were the top ten biggest landslide presidential elections?,"A landslide is victory by an overwhelming margin. Ronald Reagan in 1984 won 49 of 50 states and 58% of the popular vote. That was a landslide. Richard Nixon in 1972 won 49 of 50 states and 60% of the popular vote. That was a landslide. Donald Trump won 46% of the popular vote and his electoral vote margin ranks 44th in history, out of 58 total elections. There is no reasonable definition of a landslide under which Trump‚Äôs election qualifies as a landslide. None. Calling something a landslide just because you want to believe it is one does not make it a landslide. Trump won. He won according to the rules of the system. He need make no apology for winning. But the desire to describe a win that is clearly NOT a landslide as though it is one is just nonsensical, and speaks to insecurity both on the part of Trump and his supporters who want to believe it was a landslide. Very few presidential elections are landslides. You do not need to win in a landslide to be a legitimate or successful president. This was not a landslide. I‚Äôve had people write comments on some of my answers to the effect that ‚ÄúSince the media was against him and everyone expected him to lose, that makes it a landslide.‚Äù NO. That makes it an  upset.  Trump‚Äôs election was definitely an upset. But it was not a landslide. To be a landslide, he would have to have won overwhelmingly. He lost the popular vote (whose importance is mainly symbolic) and his electoral vote margin ranks 44th in history. That‚Äôs not a landslide no matter how hard you try to make it one. You can SAY it is a landslide all you want, and so can Trump, but no amount of saying it, or trying to redefine what a landslide is, will make it so.",https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-top-ten-biggest-landslide-presidential-elections,"UPSET.

Presidential Election,2014 Indonesian Presidential Election:  Should Jokowi run for presidency?,"I think it's almost unpatriotic to answer no. Here's why:  Asking this is the same as asking whether Indonesia should be governed for another 5 years by corrupt bureaucrats and self-serving politicians before we get a leader as capable and honest as Jokowi to start the process of de-corrupting and actually start building Indonesia. I'm amazed that many Indonesians are still ignorant of how corrupt Indonesia is, in so many ways, and how urgent it is to save the nation.  One fact that many people are oblivious to: instituting real change in Indonesia entails going against the status quo and making lots of powerful enemies in the process. Corruption is a systemic thing maintained by networks of powerful groups (political parties, political dynasties, oligarchs etc.) and people, not something done by some random bureaucrats or politicians that many are led to believe. Those caught by KPK were just the tip of the iceberg. I mean seriously, do you believe there's any other potential candidate who's brave enough (or crazy, depending on how one sees it)  to go against the status quo (most other candidates are in fact part of the status quo themselves) and constitute real change in Indonesia other than him? Jokowi (and Ahok) has shown what I thought any governor of Jakarta would have to do to actually solve one of Jakarta's problems: to fight the gangsters of Tanah Abang; and he did that early in his tenure. How many Jakarta governors before him did the same thing? None. A leader of Jokowi's calibre only comes along once in a lifetime. Why deprive Indonesia of such leadership, even for another 5 years? Please stop the BS about how Jokowi should finish his term in Jakarta before running for Presidency in 2019. Why wait 5 years if we can start the process of reversing the downward spiral and finally end the pervasive corruption in Indonesia in 2014? It's long overdue for Indonesia to have a leader with Jokowi's qualities to begin with. Besides, Jakarta will be better off if Jokowi becomes President as lots of authorities relating to Jakarta's affairs are in the hands of central government anyway. This is one of the excuses uttered by previous Jakarta governors, including Foke, on why they can't do much about Jakarta's problems. If he's seen as a job hopper for running next year for presidency so be it. It's not like he needs to craft his CV to get a better job somewhere after the end of his Jakarta governorship. For those who say that Jokowi should only run in 2019 because they need to be convinced of Jokowi's ability, I would ask why not in 2024 or 2029? Anyone who wants proof of Jokowi's ability only need to see his track-record in Solo. He doesn't need to prove himself again in Jakarta before running for Presidency, he's done that already in Solo. Those that still need some convincing will not be convinced even after seeing more realities and proofs anyway. Whatever he does there will always be people who condemn him. Damn if he does and damn if he doesn't. So just do the right thing: run for Presidency in 2014. I think there are many people in Indonesia with the same mindset as Jokowi or Ahok. It's just most are reluctant to show their real colour just yet or haven't gotten the courage to act. The majority still do not believe that their idealism has any chance of surviving in the present Indonesia. Jokowi and Ahok are 2 role models of the new breed of leaders of Indonesia. They have started this movement of New Jakarta and it will get larger in scale once more leaders got inspired and follow their foot steps. Right now most are just watching from the sideline with some hope and disbelieve whether this is a real thing or just a passing fad. Installing Jokowi at the helm will only propagate this movement. If he doesn't run for presidency it's a big loss for Indonesia. So, it's a definite YES! Jokowi should run for presidency, next year that is, not in 2019. It's the only patriotic thing to do.  My personal prediction: Jokowi will run for presidency next year and win. Then Indonesia will wake up from its long slumber and fulfil its destiny to become a great nation. Selamat Hari Kemerdekaan Indonesia ke-68. *March 14, 2014 Update:  My first prediction just becoming a reality . Yeay!
 Jokowi ready to run for president  *July 23, 2014 Update:  It's official! By the grace of God the Almighty Jokowi has won Indonesia's 2014 presidential election.  The second part of my prediction, made almost a year ago before many even believe Jokowi should run for office, is a reality now . Off course you will see the dark forces in Indonesia, those whom I mentioned in the answer above, do whatever in their capacity to cling to power because Jokowi's presidency will be the begining of the end for them. I'm not saying that the political forces backing Jokowi for presidency represent only the good forces but for the time being they are at least friendly ones.  Now, for Indonesia to fulfil its destiny to become a great nation I think Jokowi realizes that he can not rely on the political forces that backed him for presidency as many are in fact part of the problem, not solution. Jokowi, I believe, understands that he need to gather support from the new breed of Indonesians who have untill recently been largely abstain from and apathetic toward politics to take a more active role in politics and government. That means he needs YOU, yes you, and me to take a more active role in making this achievement a reality. So let's stop the corrupt way of doing things and work our ass off to begin the 'mental revolution' and a change of mindset to make Indonesia a great nation.

Ibanez Series S,Why does Joe Satriani prefer Ibanez guitars?,"Joe Satriani  first endorsed the Ibanez 540 Radius in 1988 because it suits his style of play. The Japanese made R540's are very high quality  guitars which is still a great value if you can find a used online : for usually around $500 Ibanez went on to build Satriani a custom JS model built to his preferred specifications.  There is a wide range of current JS models available from lower end JS140 for $700 to the top shelf model the JS2450 which can be had for around $2500. Joe started with the radius 540 due to its excellent quality, durability-playability not to mention the reasonable price. Before Joe became a superstar guitar god he was just a virtuoso touring guitarist I would bet that cost was a relevant factor. I personally owned a Ibanez R540 in the early nineties. Its a highly versatile guitar thats has an excellent feel and sound even when not plugged into an amp! The r540 has a thin neck : ""ultra"" which is perfect for fasting playing techniques such as sweeping.

Additionally, the guitar has a trem-setter tremolo system that is very similar to a Floyd Rose system. The trem-setter is great for extreme divebombs, gargles, and scooping techniques. The guitar stays in tune due to the double locking nut tremelo system. Ultimately, for a well known guitarists its a good thing to have guitar endorsement deal.  Satriani was able to take it further when Ibanez agreed to create a signature series in his name the JS model. Joe stated in interviews :  ""They (Ibanez) really feel  like the ultimate instrument to me"". Perhaps, his commission checks on these guitars is also quite fair?  Joe stated in an early interview with Steve Adelson:  ""Ibanez, of course, are my guitars of choice. They've  designed them around every little thing that I need"".",https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Joe-Satriani-prefer-Ibanez-guitars,,,,,

Presidential Election,Did Democrats commit major fraud in the 2020 presidential election?,"Yes. By having more people vote for Biden than for Trump. A lot of them did mail in their ballots. Republicans apparently believe mailing in ballots is fraudulent. They filed dozens of lawsuits trying to get mail in ballots rejected. The courts decided that voting by mail is not fraud. So those courts are frauds. A kooky lawyer from Texas was absolutely sure that voting machines that tabulated votes all around the country must have been switching votes from Trump to Biden. She went on many news stations making those claims and even filed a couple of lawsuits with those claims. The manufacturer of those voting machines has sued the lawyer for defemation. Now the lawyer is claiming that no reasonable person would have believed her claims. So, good on the judges that threw out her lawsuits, right? Nope. Those judges are frauds, but at least reasonable people according to this Texas lawyer because they didn't believe her arguments were factual. They claim dead people voted. I have it on good authority that not a single dead person voted in the 2020 election. That's right, not one. There were very few instances where a living person tried to submit a ballot in a deceased person's name. Those few instances so far have been votes for Trump, not for Biden. Even if those votes had been for Biden less than 10 nationwide out of a gap 7 million votes really isn't enough to swing an election. So, the only fraud are those who voted for Biden when Trump and his fans really, really, really wanted those people to vote for Trump. In fact, those who voted for Biden really should have voted for Trump. That fraud must be fixed. Texas filed a lawsuit to have the State legislatures in certain states overrule the popular votes and assign electoral college electors for Trump instead of Biden. That'll fix the fraud of the majority of people voting for the wrong person. Well, the Supreme Court with its three hand picked Trump appointees proved to be just as fraudulent as everybody else. They somehow decided Texas had no standing. Let's get this straight, if another State tells Texas they did their election wrong, that other State has no standing. Texas should be able to tell all the other 49 States what to do when it comes to electing presidents. It's the only right way. Since the Electoral College will be voting for Biden, that must be a fraudulent vote. Thankfully, we have a Vice President in Mike Pence that can change Electoral votes. He surely won't let the fraudulent Electoral College stand on January 6th. What? Pence is saying he doesn't have that power? He's a fraud, too! Well, the only way to undo fraud that has gone through every layer of government except our Dear Leader Trump is to do this ourselves. Mount up boys! We're going into the Capitol! Well, now the US criminal courts are frauds, too. They're charging Republicans, the ones who tried to save this country from the fraud that shows at every level criminals. This can't be. Republicans are the law and order party. They support police. Except the fraudulent police at the Capitol who were trying to stop us from getting in, but that's different.

Presidential Election,U.S. Presidential Elections: Would Trump beat Sanders if they were the nominees for President?,"Here's an answer I posted on a question about which Democratic candidate the Republicans would rather face in the general election.  Broader than just Trump, but here's the full view I currently have. I think it depends on which Republican eventually gets the nomination.  Maybe that's stating the obvious, but you have to look at it in individual candidates rather than all the GOP. Trump : he won't care who the candidate is, because he'll simply continue the campaign of insults and incomplete/misguided policies that he's campaigned under so far.  That being said, I think he should have an easier time with Clinton than Bernie. He'll capitalize on every negative thing that's been made public about  Clinton .  He's already proven that he will stoop to make fun of her for using the restroom during a debate.  He will get his already angry base even more worked up on anti-Clinton rhetoric that they probably already harbor.  He's tapped into their grudges on many topics to get this popular and will ramp it up when he has one Democratic target.  She'll put up a good fight, but there's a lot of dirt for someone like Trump to use. Bernie  will be tougher, because Trump has already pointed out this campaign has shown they're the two candidates highlighting the fact that more and more of the country is veering away from the ""politics as usual"" party lines.  Everything he calls Bernie out on will be met with, ""Yes, I am a Socialist Democrat and I'm sick of rich people getting everything while the poor suffer.""  With Trump being rich, he's got what argument?  ""I'm worth (overstated) $10 billion and have built businesses, blah, blah, blah.""  It doesn't help that Trump's tax plan is the 2nd-most favorable to the 1% income earners after Cruz's plan.  Bernie would also have a better shot at pulling some Independents over than Clinton.  Independents thus far have stated not liking Clinton OR Trump. For the  rest of the GOP field , I think they'd prefer Clinton.  Their biggest hope is to paint either candidate as more of the same after eight years under Obama. Again,  Clinton  has the most dirt available.  She's also a Clinton, which establishment Republicans and many Independents don't want at all.  The other GOP candidates can tap into the religious conservative voters to get them mobilized against Clinton's pro-choice position. Bernie  is also very pro-choice, so it opens him up for targeting.  I don't know if it's as easy to get evangelicals mobilized against Bernie   just because he's Jewish.  If I'm not mistaken, Republicans tend to have fairly close ties to Israel, so probably not a fight they'd want to pick.  It would have to be very, very subtle.",https://www.quora.com/U-S-Presidential-Elections-Would-Trump-beat-Sanders-if-they-were-the-nominees-for-President,,,,,
Presidential Election,Why would you not vote for Bernie Sanders this presidential election?,"He is an openly admitted socialist, that's why. While I admire his immediate pragmatism, that admission  means deep down he's a dreamer - worse, a political dreamer - a believer in an economical utopia - that the state and society  can and should  provide  economically for the individual - and as such lacks an understanding on how real world economics, motivations and entrepreneurship works.  Socialists get into power by populist promises to the poorest of people. Sometime they even  deliver on those promises by spending all the nation's wealth and beyond.They leave behind a population that  expects the government to cater to their every need, a bloated state aparatus and huge national debts. Look  at Greece for a live example. Heck, look at any country  that has had socialists  in power : France, Italy, UK in the 60s, most of the Eastern European countries. Socialism is a siren song populist politicians  sing to the poor, but once you've gone down  that smooth path of tax and spread and nationalize wealth, it's very painful to come back and a rude awakening awaits when all the money run out. Just don't go. P.S. It says volumes about  how much US has shifted  to the left, and how many more poor or disenfranchised  people there  are compared  to say, fifty years ago - that he's considered a viable  candidate rather  than a joke.

Fashion 2022,The Boston Patriots picked up Mac Jones (#15 DP) for the QB position? What‚Äôs going to happen with Cam Newton?,"New England is staging a good old fashioned quarterback contest, and it likely doesn't care who wins so long as  someone  steps up and definitively claims the job. In one corner, you have Newton, a former league MVP and a player who, at his peak, was capable of putting a team on his back and making it a Super Bowl contender. But unfortunately, due to overuse and injury, Newton hasn't been at his peak in years, and in his first season with New England, there wasn't a whole lot of ‚Äúold‚Äù Cam. There are ways to downplay 2020 - a strange year for the league, a new offensive system, more injuries, and a COVID-19 infection for Newton - but there wasn't a lot that screamed ‚Äústarter for the long haul.‚Äù Still, if Newton regains his form, he'd be a top 10 quarterback in the league and still young enough to have some football left in him, so the Patriots wouldn't complain. In the other corner, there's Jones. A lot of teams fell in love with him leading up to the draft, and there were rumors he might go as high as #3. But at the same time, Jones is also a one-year wonder who put up big numbers playing on a team loaded with offensive talent and who doesn't have elite athleticism or incredible arm talent, and therefore probably has a lower ceiling than many of his first-round peers. Just as there were teams that loved Jones, there were teams that wouldn't have given him a first-round grade. The truth is likely in the middle: what you're getting - unless Jones finds another gear in the NFL - is a patient pocket passer who isn't going to make a ton of ‚Äúwow!‚Äù plays but who has a chance to be a bona fide starter in the right system. A lot of draft gurus had Jones going to New England precisely because of the system match, so the potential's there. But unless Jones has the the training camp of his life, the plan is likely to have him sit and learn as long as possible. So my guess is that Newton is the starter as long as he plays well. If Newton turns back the clock, I don't think the Patriots will have any problem with him being the starter even in  2022  or beyond, because he's a Hall of Famer when healthy and guys like that don't grow on trees. But it's easy to envision a scenario where Jones is given the keys this year because Newton just can't make things happen. The likeliest scenario is an Alex Smith in Kansas City situation, where Newton is the safe starter this year and Jones is groomed for next year.",https://www.quora.com/The-Boston-Patriots-picked-up-Mac-Jones-15-DP-for-the-QB-position-What-s-going-to-happen-with-Cam-Newton,"Yeah, you‚Äôve said exactly what other Pats fans and radio show hosts have said. With the Patriots, it is always ‚ÄúPut up or shut up‚Äù: if Bill B thinks the person (namely Cam Newton) is competing hard and playing well, then Cam is going to be the starter.",Your last paragraph hits the nail on the head.,"‚ÄúA lot of draft gurus had Jones going to New England precisely because of the system match, so the potential's there. ‚Äú I was reading your description of him and head to check you hadnt switched to talk about Brady.",Jones ceiling is Drew Brees.

Presidential Election,Which current presidential election polls are the most and/or least reliable and why?,"I think there are a lot of good comments on here, and I think this is an important topic.  Let's start at the beginning. Any poll released by a campaign or a political party should be looked at with suspicion. It's not that campaign pollsters are bad (in fact they are quite good), but that they only release polls that show their candidates in favorable positions. They may also release a result that reflects one turnout scenario (e.g. 60% of all eligible voters) when another more likely scenario (e.g. 70% of all eligible voters) is kept secret because it doesn't reflect well on the candidate. There's a pretty decent rule that if a campaign or a party releases a poll subtract 6 points from the margin for the candidate for whom the poll is being released.  Remember a campaign will often only release a poll when the public polling is bad and/or they need a fundraising boost.  Most polls are not polls done on behalf of candidate, party, or interest group. Most are public. I'm one who believes that there really aren't any great pollsters, but there are really bad ones. My own look at pollster ratings illustrated that there really isn't any consistency from year to year. (http://poughies.blogspot.com/2011/05/predicting-elections-is-like-nfl-we.html) Most of these ratings don't take into account the months before the end of the campaign, so it's difficult to note if any one pollster did better at predicting the result in say August than another one.  My simple rules for a pollster are a. do they do callbacks? You want a truly random sample. If harder to reach folk aren't tried again, you really are limiting yourself to only the most reachable/enthusiastic. That's not good. Response rates won't be good no matter what, but 10% is better than 5%. b. Do they call cell phones or can they reach those who do (e.g. online panel)? Again, if you don't, you're likely missing 20-30% of the population. c. have they polled before? If not, remember they could be one of the bad pollsters.  Finally, the average of the polls is likely to be more accurate than any one poll. I'm in the camp that any aggregate you choose is good. Whether it be Nate at 538, RCP, or Huff Pollster. All three are going to be as accurate at the end of the day.

Presidential Election,Which teachings of Jesus would support Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election?,"The climate that Jesus born in was a politically charged one. The hated Romans had invaded the country, tax-collectors (some who were Jewish) were bleeding the people dry and the religious establishment debated among themselves whether they should support the Roman. The zealots disagreed vehemently, while the Pharisees decided it was better to side with the Romans. So when Jesus came, and declared himself a Prophet of God, everyone wanted him to answer the Roman question. Would the Romans be driven out of Israel? Would he now re-establish the Kingdom of God on Earth? Much to everyone‚Äôs dismay back then, Jesus was talking about a Kingdom of the heart, represented by love, grace and forgiveness. The political issues of the day was of no concern ‚Äî but you, what are you going to do about the Good News? His message was difficult to accept, today as it was before.

Presidential Election,Could Frank Underwood have defeated Donald Trump in the 2016 US presidential election?,"Road to nomination: Frank Underwood would be Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign machine. Frank wouldn‚Äôt be able to receive party nomination. It‚Äôs not his expertise. The best he could do was gather support for Hillary and make sure he became VP. Underwood is an optimistic realist. He knew where he stood and what to do to step forward. How did you think Hillary won that many Democratic delegates compared to Bernie Sanders? Yeah, that‚Äôs Frank Underwood. Vice presidency: Frank need to make sure his services was greatly compensated, and he quickly destroyed all other VP candidates, making sure he‚Äôs the only viable option. On Republican Nominee: Trump against all odds won the Republican nomination. Realistically Underwood didn‚Äôt have the time nor energy to intercept this. Trump has a lot of attack surface, his opponents attacked him on that, but he prevailed. On campaign: Hillary Clinton wanted to attack his inexperience too, but Underwood knew better. Still, he‚Äôs just a VP, Hillary was the President candidate, so there isn‚Äôt much he could do about that. Yet Underwood is good in one thing, working behind the scene. He‚Äôd gather everything he could get about Trump, he‚Äôd focus on Trump‚Äôs tax returns, he‚Äôd collect Trump‚Äôs hypocrisy, he‚Äôd attack Melanie, he‚Äôd attack Trump‚Äôs relationship with Russia. At this point the email scandal came out, damaging Hillary, also Bill‚Äôs scandal came out. Hillary is battered, but Underwood saw an opportunity. He began selling himself. He praised Hillary, apologetic with the incident, but promised thing will be better with him as VP, and turned their attention toward Trump. He had gathered those slighted by Trump in the past, building contractors, business partners, investors. Showing how incompetent Trump was no matter how competent he claimed. Call for Trump‚Äôs tax return soon came up. A week later it magically came up on New York Times. Claire was doing talkshow, about the power of woman, praising Hillary. Suddenly a recording of Pussy Grab came out. Claire looked shaken, then she opened up about as a past rape victim. Hillary Clinton jumped on that scandal, and Trump‚Äôs under relentless fire. Meanwhile Underwood made deals with Majority Leader, Paul Ryan made a lot of vocal complaint against Trump. Mail Scandal drowned out, Pussy grab was noisier than Bill Clinton, Miss Americans participants took to the street. Presidency: Hillary was inaugurated, taking electoral college by storm as defiant Trump refused to step down and let Pence step up. Within a year, Hillary‚Äôs health deteriorated, Underwood did most of presidential job. Three months‚Äô later, movement began around congress and senate to urge Hillary to step down.

Overwhelming older white voters Blue color voters that connected with DJT, these are democrats otherwise. Less minority and millennial population Anti establishment wave in that part of country. Snapshot - look at primaries. republicans had 1.3 Million turnout and Dems had 1.1 Million turnout. Bernie sanders and Trump won because of people in that state wanted a change and I have no doubt it will turn red for the first time since 1988. IA, OH - will turn red for reasons similar to MI. FL - a true swing state in my opinion but will turn red because of Tampa. Obama won FL in 2012 only because Tamps voted Blue. In my opinion Tampa Bay decided FL as South Florida is blue due to hispanic population from PR and North Florida is red. Tampa will turn red because of high older and retired white population and they are breaking for Trump. So FL will be RED. Margin of victory will be about 3 % for Trump. VT, NH - will be red because of Bernie sanders support and his followers are less likely to vote HRC because of email and rigging revelations. they wont vote Trump but will either write in Bernie or not vote at all. This will drain a lot of votes from HRC and will eventually turn the states red. NV will be Red, because the state is overall turning republican, even though it has 33% hispanic population, the economics of state especially Vegas area are very favorable to Trump. ME 2nd Dist - governor support and majority are blue collar workers that support Trump. NC- Will turn Blue.

Presidential Election,Which states had the most surprising 2012 Presidential election results?,"It looks like Obama is going to win by about 2 or 3 points, while national polling seemed to indicate that Obama was only up by about a point: 2012 - General Election: Romney vs. Obama | RealClearPolitics This would seem to vindicate the state polling-based approach advocated by Nate Silver, Sam Wang, Drew Linzer, and others. In individual states, Obama outperformed RCP polling averages by at least a couple points in Virginia, Florida, Colorado, Nevada, Iowa, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Oregon.  He also beat the RCP polling average by about a point in North Carolina.  It's possible that the Obama campaign's claims of a superior ground game were accurate.  Surprisingly, the only swing state where Obama didn't beat the polls is the one state that many thought was the most crucial asset to his election: Ohio. I was also surprised that Romney won in Arizona by about 12 points, when polling showed Obama down by about 7.5 points, and Obama crushed Romney in the Hispanic vote throughout the country. It looks like Democrats are going to hold Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri, Montana, and (possibly) North Dakota.  That counts as a surprise given that many predicted the GOP would win those seats, although Democrats seemed like the clear favorites in Indiana and Missouri in recent weeks.  Democrats also did slightly better than some expected in the Montana, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Virginia, Connecticut, and Florida Senate races.   Most of the results were close to the polls...except in Missouri, where polls showed McCaskill up by about 6, and she won by about 15 points (if you don't know why, look up Todd Akin).  If Heitkamp pulls of an upset in North Dakota, she'll also do a bit better than polling indicated.   Republican Dean Heller's win in Nevada is somewhat impressive.  While Obama won his state by 7 points, and Republican Senate candidates crashed and burned throughout the country, Heller managed to pull out a win, despite never having run statewide before.

Under Constantine,  India have been very progressive raising from 173 to 97  in the latest FIFA rankings. In Asia, presently India are ranked 15th. I know it's good to be optimistic but I would be very very happy if we can qualify for the  semis  , which means we are top 4 teams in Asia. That's an incredible achievement.  (There are 8 spots for asian teams in 2022 world cup, so I think you can feel how big a deal it is) We play UAE and Bahrain next, it maybe a easy tie against Bahrain but will be difficult(not impossible)to overcome the hosts. If we finish first in our group, we have a great chance of going into quarters as we face as third placed team of group C/D/E. If we finish second, we most probably face China or south Korea, which will be a tough tie no doubt. If we finish third, we face a group B/C winner and surely would be more difficult. As we go on, we will get tougher teams and greater challenges and I hope the team will overcome them. It would be wonderful if India perform exceeding well so that it might act like a very good catalyst for the growth of the beautiful game in India and possibly make our world cup dream a reality as soon as possible. #Backtheblues .

YG Entertainment is treating her very well like the queen that she is but recently and also after the change of YG Entertainment‚Äôs CEO, BLINKS noticed the different treatment she got compared to the other members‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. As you know, Jisoo, Ros√© and recently Jennie have all attended the Paris Fashion Week Spring 2022, representing their own brand as their global ambassadors and Lisa is the global ambassador for Celine and BVLGARI but she won‚Äôt be attending any of the events since according to YG, due to COVID, Lisa won‚Äôt be attending the Paris Fashion Week even though she‚Äôs fully vaccinated and is in Nice at the moment but will be flying to Paris soon anyway which made BLINKS mad on why YG won‚Äôt let her attend the Paris Fashion Week‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. And this is just one of the many‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Lisa made her solo debut on September 10th, 2021 with her first single album LALISA with the title track ‚ÄúLALISA‚Äù and B-side track ‚ÄúMoney‚Äù. Lisa‚Äôs solo debut is considered one of the hottest music events of 2021 and when it was released, the song immediately topped the iTunes, Apple Music, and Billboard Digital Charts and many other charts around the world including Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Hong Kong, Laos, Hungary, Vietnam, France, Kenya, Armenia and MANY MANY more including the Worldwide iTunes Charts.

She‚Äôs never received proper promotions for her solo and BLINKS and LILIES were mad, demanding YG to give just proper promotions as they did with Jennie and Ros√©‚Äôs solo debut‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  Despite all that, YG still didn‚Äôt listen to fans‚Äô pleads and in the end, Lisa only got 1 Music Show win on Music Bank and BLINKS and LILIES never got to see Lisa‚Äôs encore stage‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. When LALISA era finally ended, BLINKS and LILIES were sad and mad but despite that, they still go on Lisa‚Äôs fan sign and comforted her saying she‚Äôs the champion in BLINKS and LILIES hearts, which she is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.üíõ  Another thing on why I think she‚Äôll extend her contract with YG is because if you compare YG with other companies, they only get a small portion of the artist‚Äôs paycheck which you can see, YG artists are all rich‚Ä¶. And YG doesn‚Äôt actually ask or force their idols to go on extreme diets and let them managed their own diets‚Ä¶.. As you can see, BLACKPINK ate A LOT anywhere and everywhere, especially during their reality TV show, ‚ÄúBLACKPINK House‚Äù!!    YG Entertainment also gives their idols a lot of freedom compared to other companies, letting them hang out with friends, have a girl‚Äôs night, and stuff like that‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ As you can see, Ros√© and Lisa actually ordered room service (And they ordered  A LOT , I can‚Äôt even finish thatü§£) on their trip to Jeju Island which is something that companies don‚Äôt really allow‚Ä¶..   So if Lisa signed with a new label, she might not get all that anymore unless it‚Äôs a label like P Nation which is probably the BEST company in KPOP based on treatment and 100% freedom to their idols‚Ä¶!!  So after all that, what do you think? If you were Lisa, will you extend your contract or sign with a new label? Feel free to leave your opinions!! üòä Enjoy your day or night!! :)) ",https://www.quora.com/Will-Lisa-from-BLACKPINK-extend-her-contracts-with-YG-Entertainment,"Yes, people only see the negative sides of YG. They didn‚Äôt see the positive sides.","Just saying it was kind of obvious that Blackpink House was staged. There were literally 40 cameras in the house too, the girls had no privacy.","very concerned for many people angry about the fashion week. Do you guys know Lisa can‚Äôt attend Paris Fashion week because she wasn‚Äôt invited. BVLGARI is an Italian brand not French, hence why their mid sized event is held in ITALY. Also, the covid excuse YG used does make sense. there has been a sudden rise in covid cases again in Milan, and Lisa is hugely popular and would be surrounded by too many people, so why risk it?",,
Presidential Election,"Leaving out ideology, do you give Donald Trump credit for pulling off such a stunning victory in the 2016 presidential election?","Absolutely. What Donald Trump accomplished in the 2016 presidential election was flat out  outstanding . Look at this map on Election Night:  Trump knew the odds were behind him. Hillary was a lousy campaigner. She simply campaigned to  run up the score  and to add on to the  popular vote . Hillary campaigned in California. Why? California is going to vote for virtually anybody with the letter D next to your name, so don‚Äôt spend time there. I get it, you ran up the score, flipping Orange County blue for the first time in 80 years. For all that extra effort, you still got the same 55 electoral votes that Obama won back in 2012. Hillary campaigned in Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. Why? These are states that have almost never gone blue in recent history. Arizona has voted blue once since 1948. North Carolina has voted blue once since 1976. Georgia hasn‚Äôt voted blue since 1992. Now before you ask me, then  why did Donald Trump campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which hadn‚Äôt voted red since the 1980‚Äôs , I‚Äôll give answer you right away: Donald Trump HAD no other choice. His safe states didn‚Äôt account for enough electoral votes as Hillary‚Äôs.  By being a Republican, Donald Trump lost out on 104 free electoral votes on three out of the six most popular states‚ÄîCalifornia, New York, and Illinois. Therefore, he had more pressure to win swing states than Hillary.  Trump couldn‚Äôt afford to lose Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina. After he focused there, he needed to focus on specific subsets of swing states: New England.  The bluest of blue America, which two main exceptions‚Ä¶New Hampshire and Maine. New Hampshire voted for George W. Bush in 2000, the only time any GOP candidated picked up electoral votes in New England from 1992 to 2012. I was equally impressed that Trump ALMOST picked up New Hampshire, a state that unseated a Republican senator that same year. Trump lost it by a mere 2,700 popular votes. Impressive. However, he did manage to pick up one of Maine‚Äôs four electoral votes‚Äîthe rural, northern 2nd congressional district of Maine (which is the ONLY congressional district in New England represented by a Republican). Trump made countless stops just to pick up  one  electoral vote in Maine, and that‚Äôs impressive. The Mountain West.  Because Hillary believed the Rust Belt was a wrap, she focused on the Mountain West to run up the score. The Left Coast (Washington, Oregon, and California) were already safely blue. So Hillary spent a  majority  of her time campaigning on the following four swing states: Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. Arizona was the only state that voted GOP in 2008 and 2012. The other three voted for Obama twice. Donald Trump knew that he didn‚Äôt have the time or resources to win BOTH the Mountain West AND the Rust Belt. So obviously, he had to choose, and his choice was obvious and something he doesn‚Äôt regret today‚Ä¶ Virginia.  Also considered ‚Äúexcess‚Äù for Hillary, all she needed to do was to maintain Virginia, a state that had voted GOP since the 1960‚Äôs until Barack Obama won it in 2008 and again in 2012. Hillary  specifically  selected Virginia‚Äôs junior U.S. senator Tim Kaine as her running mate to seal Virginia. Trump did his best here, but he realized in late October that he needed focus on the Rust Belt because they were worth more electoral votes than Virginia. As a result, he withdrew all campaigning in Virginia thinking:  I can afford to lose Virginia as long as I win Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, or even a combination of the four.  Which leads me to the final subset‚Ä¶ The Rust Belt.  The region that has decided every single election since the 1990‚Äôs and was  especially  responsible for Trump‚Äôs stunning victory in 2016. Wisconsin hadn‚Äôt voted GOP since 1984, when Reagan won 49 states. Michigan and Pennsylvania hadn‚Äôt voted GOP since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won 40 states and 426 electoral votes. But Trump managed to do it. He picked up Iowa by almost 10 points, and Ohio by over 8 points. Even more impressive was Trump  almost  winning Minnesota. He lost it by just a single point, and Reagan couldn‚Äôt even win it twice. Minnesota has the country‚Äôs longest blue streak at 10 (now 11), and for a lousy candidate he  almost  won Minnesota. And that wasn‚Äôt even the most impressive part‚Ä¶ Trump won WI, MI, and PA by a combined 70,000-vote margin. That was enough to win 46 electoral votes. They proved to be the difference between Hillary winning 278‚Äì260 to Trump winning 306‚Äì232. How did Hillary  allow  Trump to compete in the blue wall? Trump would have been happy just to pick up  one  blue state, but how did he manage to pick virtually  every  state in the blue wall except Minnesota? That‚Äôs what impressed me the most. Trump picked up almost  every  single state in the blue wall‚Ä¶he was a  single  point away from taking Minnesota as well. Kellyanne Conway, whether you like her or not, deserves a ton of credit.  Kellyanne Conway is the first woman to ever lead a successful presidential campaign, and she will never be credited for that.  But without her, Trump‚Äôs victory would have never been made possible. EDIT #1: I also want to point out‚Ä¶President Obama deserves a ton of credit for his electoral victories in 2008 (especially) and 2012.  What the Rust Belt and Maine‚Äôs 2nd congressional district were to Trump‚Ä¶Indiana, North Carolina, Virginia, and Nebraska‚Äôs 2nd congressional district were to Obama. The last time a Democrat won  any  electoral vote from Nebraska was in 1964. Indiana, North Carolina, and Virginia also carried long red streaks, which Obama flipped to his favor. Of course, today, only Virginia is reliably blue‚Ä¶and it may flip again. North Carolina was in play both times in 2012 and 2016 but went red on both. Indiana is back to safely GOP and seems like a lost cause for the Democrats for the time being.",https://www.quora.com/Leaving-out-ideology-do-you-give-Donald-Trump-credit-for-pulling-off-such-a-stunning-victory-in-the-2016-presidential-election,,,,,
Presidential Election,Does the popular vote actually count during a Presidential Election?,"There is no general election. If you had stayed awake during Civics, you would realize that. (My bad, they don‚Äôt teach Civics anymore.) Our country is not a democracy. It is a representative republic organized on a federal basis (as opposed to unitary, i.e. very strong central government). The issue is the distribution of power between the central government and its states. The US Constitution is our supreme law and limits the sovereignty of the states. The American constitutional system recognizes the concept of ""state sovereignty"" where certain matters are subject to government regulation, but only at the state and not the federal level. For example, if I drive from Columbus, Ohio to Ann Arbor, Michigan, I don‚Äôt need a passport. However if I move from Columbus to Ann Arbor, I must apply for a new driver‚Äôs license. The much maligned Electoral College has its roots in federalism. (This is uniformly ignored by its critics.) The Electoral College ensures that the president is chosen by a constitutional majority. Candidates must accommodate a variety of interests and viewpoints. It is not possible to win the presidency by concentrating too narrowly on a handful of states, regions, or metropolitan population centers. (For example just nine states contain half the population of the US. Half of Clinton‚Äôs popular vote advantage comes from one city.) What happened in the Rust Belt in this election year (2016) is illustrative. The Democratic candidate took Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania‚Äîwhich had all voted Democrat for the last six cycles‚Äîfor granted. (Clinton only campaigned sporadically in Pennsylvania. She never visited a United Auto Workers union hall in Michigan and, following the primary, never set foot in Wisconsin.) The combined 46 electoral votes determined the result of the election demonstrating that with the Electoral College there are no permanent ‚Äúsafe states.‚Äù When a state ceases to be persuaded, it either becomes a swing state or a safe state for the opposing political party. In the US, with a federal government, the law is that the states determine who becomes president‚Äînot the national popular vote. The Electoral College voted for the president-elect on Monday, December 19, 2016 and on January 20, 2017, whether we like it or not, he will be sworn in. That‚Äôs the way it works. I hope you realize this question has been asked 50 times in the last two weeks.",https://www.quora.com/Does-the-popular-vote-actually-count-during-a-Presidential-Election,"Actually, Hamilton stated that the electoral college was created because people would not know much about politicians from other states and would thus elect electors who would then use their thought to be superior judgement to choose the president, possibly to prevent demagogues such as Trump from being elected. Of course the founders were not a monolith group, and it is difficult to interpret their original intent. You are right that the states may choose their own electors however they see fit. Right now, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska, they select them on a winner take all basis. However, there is a measure known as the National Popular Voting Interstate Compact, which if passed in enough states that compose a majority of the electoral college, those states would award their electors to the winner of the popular vote. It currently has been passed in 10 states that have 165 electoral votes. It may also interest you that historically the majority of all Americans of both parties would prefer a direct popular vote vs our current system, the exception being Republicans now and in 2000.",,,,
Pepe the frog,"What current trends do you think will be made fun of in the future (e.g., slang, games, etc.)?","I hope that the current trend of News Media accepting anything 4chan says as gospel if it fits with a narrative they want to print gets torn to shreds for the next 2 decades, shaming all future news media out of potentially printing idiotic stories like these: Pepe the Racist?

Presidential Election,Trump said they might postpone the US presidential election. Can they do that?,"Trump said they might postpone the US presidential election. Can they do that? In comments, you claim that Trump, in the press briefing on April 3, 2020, announced his intent to try to postpone the November election. You are misinformed. Trump did not say that. I‚Äôve asked you, and I‚Äôll ask you again, to find the video of that press briefing and cite his exact words. He did make some comments during that briefing about the proposed postponement of the  primary  election in Wisconsin. The Governor has proposed postponing that election, scheduled for Tue Apr 7, due to the pandemic. Trump accused him of wanting to postpone it because a conservative judge endorsed by Trump is on the ballot. Note that, in that context, Trump  opposed  postponing an election, though not the one you claimed he was talking about. Donald Trump has no authority to postpone the November election, whose date is specified by law. If he were successful in postponing the election, his term would still end at noon on January 20, 2021. If he somehow managed to prevent an election from being held by that time (both the general election in November and the meetings of electors in December), he would still leave office, and succession laws would be invoked. He cannot serve a second term without being re-elected. It‚Äôs possible that Donald Trump might propose postponing the November election, in ignorance of the fact that he has no authority to do so and it wouldn‚Äôt help him personally anyway. It‚Äôs not at all plausible that your question on Quora would be the only place I‚Äôve heard about it, and that I‚Äôve seen none of the inevitable outrage such a suggestion would have triggered.

Presidential Election,How do you feel about the 2020 presidential election outcome?,"Okay, let me be clear‚ÄîI think the results are legitimate. Biden won. I know a lot of other conservatives are calling B.S. on the election results, and claiming that the Democrats pulled some dirty trick to win. But I am not so pessimistic about the American political process as to believe that it‚Äôs  that  easy (as yet) to steal an election. I think this is genuinely what the American people wanted‚Äîa Biden-Harris administration. That being said‚Ä¶ I experienced all the usual reactions when I found out this morning that Biden had collected enough electoral votes to win the US presidential election: Bitter disappointment. Disillusionment with the American political process in general. Despair at the gullibility of the electorate. A burning desire to move to a cabin in Alaska and forget all about politics. The urge to never vote again. It was fortunate that I happened to be out on a morning walk when I got the news, however, because it let me process it and digest it in intellectual and spiritual peace (and relative quiet). Here are my thoughts as of now (11:45 AM Mountain Standard Time): I agree with many Quorans‚Äô assertion that Biden‚Äôs presidency, at least compared his predecessor‚Äôs, is going to be a bowl of lukewarm Campbell‚Äôs soup. I‚Äôm not expecting any stellar achievements or drastic moves. I‚Äôm expecting, rather, a continuation of Obama‚Äôs presidency, without the same depth of moral conviction or charisma (or public support). I expect border security to be loosened; gun restrictions tightened; the US‚Äôs membership in the Paris Accords and the TPP renewed; and perhaps even the ACA‚Äôs individual mandate reinstated. And, of course, a whole hell of a lot of empty words, shameless pandering, and virtue-signaling. I‚Äôve survived all of these things before. I‚Äôll survive them again. ‚Ä¶especially since I now live in a red state instead of a blue state. Idaho went redder than it‚Äôs been in a long time this past election. Republicans Ryan Davidson and Rod Beck unseated incumbent Democrats Diana Lachiondo and Bill Rutherford to make the Ada County Board of Commissioners two-thirds Republican. Both of Idaho‚Äôs representatives and its lone senator are Republican, as are the Ada County sheriff and prosecuting attorney. I have a feeling I‚Äôll be pretty well insulated from any left-wing madness a Biden-Harris administration can dream up for the remaining two or three years I‚Äôll be living in Idaho. After Idaho I‚Äôll either be moving to Hawaii‚Äîwhere, unfortunately, left-wing madness is all but impossible to ignore‚Äîor Alaska, where I‚Äôll be even  more  insulated from any Democratic or D.C. hijinks. But that‚Äôs so far in the future that I‚Äôm not worrying my head about it. At any rate, I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm beginning to despair of the whole election cycle. Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚ÄîI‚Äôm not throwing up my hands at the American electoral process in general, like so many virtue-signaling folk from Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand are doing. I think the American political process makes sense and has served us well for the past two hundred and fifty years. But I no longer believe that the American people  themselves  are worthy of the sacrifices, efforts, and erudition of the Founding Fathers and the colonial militia. I‚Äôve lost faith in my fellow citizens‚Äô intelligence, diligence, morals, and knowledge of civics and constitutional rights. They say a country gets the leaders it deserves, and if our choice in 2020 was between Trump and Biden‚Äîtwo ignorant, sanctimonious, authoritarian demagogues (to say nothing of that termagant Harris)‚Äîthen something is clearly effed up somewhere. I no longer hold out much hope that the American people will ever again have the good sense, common decency, or basic know-how to elect a morally and intellectually sound leader in my lifetime. On a not-entirely-unrelated note, I‚Äôve lost faith in  my own party.  I doubt that the Libertarian Party will ever be able to catch fire with the electorate, for the reasons I just delineated above. This morning I caught myself fervently hoping that, within the next two or three years, I‚Äôll be living on a remote parcel of land somewhere on the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska, having renounced my association with the Libertarian Party and joined the Alaskan Independence Party (AKIP), owning my own business, raising children, flying helicopters, unplugging from the rest of the world and its idiocies and evils and fears, paying as much or as little heed as I‚Äôve a mind to, and troubling my mind and soul no more about the sociopolitical trajectory of the United States and its collective soul. Speaking of ‚Äútroubling my mind and soul no more,‚Äù this election has hardened my resolve to get off Quora‚Äînay, all social media of any kind‚Äîfinally and permanently. I‚Äôm sick of all the vitriol I see being leveled at conservatives, libertarians, Republicans, Trump, and Americans in general on Quora and elsewhere. I‚Äôm not sure when my personal Quexit is going to be (I‚Äôll heartily acknowledge that I‚Äôm an addict, and spend hours on this site every day; weaning myself off will be no mean feat), but it‚Äôs coming. And soon. And I won‚Äôt be moving to Medium afterwards, either, because I‚Äôm poor as shit and can‚Äôt afford the membership fee. So don‚Äôt mention anything about Medium in the comments section, please. So yeah, that‚Äôs what I think about the 2020 presidential election. Side note: I feel bad for all the teenagers and young adults who are either (a) cognizant of a presidential election for the first time, and/or (b) voting in one. They‚Äôre going to think this is  normal.  They‚Äôre going to think that it‚Äôs  customary  for the tallying of the votes to take days and days, thanks to COVID-19. (Remember the good old days, when you used to find out who the next POTUS was going to be before you went to bed?) They‚Äôre going to be  accustomed  to hearing each side claim that the other is committing some sort of fraud. They‚Äôre going to think it‚Äôs  commonplace  for the sitting president to launch a series of lawsuits in battleground states instead of quietly and magnanimously conceding. And perhaps worst of all, they‚Äôre going to think it‚Äôs  okay  to blame third parties for ‚Äúsplitting the vote‚Äù instead of acknowledging that some people simply don‚Äôt like either the Republicans or the Democrats, and that it‚Äôs perfectly fine to vote for someone who doesn‚Äôt have an ‚ÄúR‚Äù or a ‚ÄúD‚Äù after their name. Sorry kids. Maybe the next election will be somewhat saner. But by that point, I‚Äôll be in the Great White North, and probably off Quora for good.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-feel-about-the-2020-presidential-election-outcome,"I agree completely with your answer except for 1 point: While I can‚Äôt speak for Australians, Brits or New Zealanders, I think as a Canadian myself, I can speak for most Canadians in saying that I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve lost faith in the American electoral system. Most Canadians I know have  deep  respect for the American electoral system, and American institutions in general. We were definitely a bit shocked that Trump was elected, but only because Canadians tend to be mild mannered and agreeable by nature, and someone with Trump‚Äôs personality wouldn‚Äôt make it very far in Canada‚Äôs political system. But we also recognize that this is a cultural difference, and has nothing to do with America or its institutions, and I actually think we understood more than many Americans, especially American Democrats,  why  Trump was elected. As well, while I absolutely don‚Äôt deny that there is vitriol directed at conservatives, libertarians and other right leaning people, there is  also  a lot of hate directed at people on the left online.

For all other types of pasta that are just shapes, strips or stings, commercially made pasta is just as good. Commercial pastas are made from the same simple ingredients that home-made pasta is made from. Even in Italy, I‚Äôve found many top chefs who will use commercially made pasta in their dishes.

Italian Restaurant,"Where are the best places to eat in Venice, Italy?","Ooh, I‚Äôm a total stickler for discovering nice restaurants abroad. I‚Äôve got a few in Venice, depending on what sort of thing you like =} Paradiso Perduto (Fondamenta della Misericordia, Cannaregio) This is the best seafood restaurant ever. It gets very busy, and you should definitely book beforehand (you can do this by phone, or just by dropping by). The menu is in Italian, which might be a bit of a bummer, but the waiters speak English and will be happy to help. I had the clam pasta, which was lovely -the pasta was yummy and buttery, and there was a generous amount of really fresh clams. Yum. My partner had this cray cheese spaghetti thing, which they bring out in a trolley still in the boiling water, and then drain the pasta right then and there and swish it around in a giant roll of parmesan. Oh-la-la =D Both dishes were delicious. We sat by the canal as it was a lovely warm summer night, and had a lovely lovely time. The place is full of locals, which gives you an idea of the quality.  from  Paradiso Perduto, Venice - Cannaregio - Restaurant Reviews, Phone Number & Photos - TripAdvisor La Zucca  in Santa Croce This is an awesome little restaurant that has a nice range of vegetarian dishes (though it also has meat dishes too). The food is so good we wanted to keep going back -the cheesy asparagus flan was to die for. My partner had the artichoke tagliatelle (yum) and I had the tomato and eggplant tagliatelle (also yum). They had plenty of yummy looking desserts, but we were just stuffed! We‚Äôll definitely be going back.  from  Osteria a Venezia - La Zucca ristorante alternativo Osteria da Rioba, also along Fondamenta della Misericordia, Cannaregio This is was a touch on the expensive side, but definitely worth it. I‚Äôd call it hipster cuisine with a Venetian twist. A massive amount of love and care has gone into everything about this restaurant -from the beautiful glasses to the menus, service, and of course, the food itself. I had some lovely, lovely swordfish -melt in the mouth. My partner had a type of pasta that was similar to ravioli (it wasn‚Äôt ravioli), which was homemade and very fresh. We also had a yummy salad, and polished a couple of carafes of white wine between us. Mmmm‚Ä¶ It was a lovely dinner, also by the canal.  from  The Cuisine | Ostria da Rioba I suppose, as a rule of thumb, my advice would be to avoid any restaurants in the centre, unless a local tells you about them (our landlord told us about Zucca, which is reasonably central). Avoid anything with a tourist menu like the plague! Wonder around Dorsoduro and Cannaregio instead, and if you see a restaurant with lots of locals in it, you know it‚Äôs worth a visit. Also, as a side note -the best ice-cream, in my humble opinion, was Nico‚Äôs along the Zattere.

There was a candidate that had policies that would enhance US science and the electorate decided that she wasn‚Äôt the person for the job. The best case scenario is that funding is reallocated and is up in some areas, particularly in research that can be transferred to defense. The worst case scenario is that the NSF is slashed. DOE science funding is slashed particularly around clean energy. NOAA is obliterated because they measure climate and there can‚Äôt be climate change if you don‚Äôt measure it. NASA science gets decimated in favor of speculative manned space exploration. NASA has satellites also measures climate change. the CDC, NIH and other federal medicine and health funding become highly politicized. the EPA is already at the bottom of the list of most-favored science agencies. the FDA may also be fit because they often run up against industry pressures. Call me a pessimist, but I‚Äôd lean towards the worst case scenario. The US is already not able to fully keep up with Europe, Japan and China in many areas in the sciences. My expectation is that this slide is going to accelerate over the next 10 years. Science funding can‚Äôt be turned on and turned off. There is a pipeline. If you turn it off for a few years, you empty out the pipeline because the scientists doing the science disappear and go into industry or decide early on to not become scientists in those areas. It takes a decade to recover, and at that point it becomes difficult to justify increasing funding the science because the US would be building off of weakness rather than strength.",https://www.quora.com/How-bad-is-the-outcome-of-the-US-2016-presidential-election-for-science,"I hope you are wrong, but I am very seriously considering leaving. My current thinking is that I will (probably) do my postdoc in the US, and then see whether the funding is still there. If not‚Ä¶","Not to mention science education, already a low priority, will probably suffer even more.","It can recover in half a decade or even less, after the US becoming a desirable place for academics to live again - by hiring foreigners, ironically.",I am sorry this is happening in your country. I truly hope this turns around for the better.,"The NIH is already ‚Äúhighly politicized‚Äù. I used to be the chairman of an NIH Study Section (on Visual Sciences). Practically all of the the NIH administrators were failed scientists who couldn‚Äôt do original research, and instead took cushy government jobs, where they could take out their resentments and jealousies on successful working scientists. The study section would painstakingly review a of bunch of grant applications each quarter, and then vote on who got funded (approximately 96% of all grant applications got denied). After that, the administrators would throw out most of the study section‚Äôs decisions, and instead award grants to whomever they pleased, even those applications that got the worst reviews, claiming ‚Äúadministrative research priorities‚Äù. Most of those awards went to personal friends of the administrators. The system is highly corrupt."
Presidential Election,What was your very first reaction upon learning Donald Trump won the presidential election?,"It‚Äôs actually one of the moments in my life I will never forget. After our long work day was done, my wife and I went to our local polling place together and voted. We then went to a local restaurant for a nice meal. We came home and watched the early election returns. Although Trump had a slight lead when we went to bed around 9:30 we both resigned ourselves to the fact that Hillary was unbeatable. We‚Äôd done our part to stop her‚Ä¶but the prospect of this corrupt and dishonest witch becoming President had us both depressed. I awoke at about 2:00 am, because nature was calling. After that I mastered my courage and turned on the TV. The first thing I saw was an ashen faced Martha Raddatz‚Ä¶I rubbed my eyes and turned up the volume. Then it hit me‚Ä¶TRUMP HAD WON!!! I ran back to the bedroom and woke my wife‚Ä¶she bounded out of bed and we both stood there staring at the TV, incredulous of what we were seeing. We flipped to other channels just to be sure. Then we embraced each other and literally jumped up and down in glee. We thanked God because this truly was a miracle!",https://www.quora.com/What-was-your-very-first-reaction-upon-learning-Donald-Trump-won-the-presidential-election,"You and your wife sound a lot like me and my wife, Jeff.

Presidential Election,Is there any possible good outcome for the 2020 presidential election?,"Yes. The election is held as planned. The result offers a clear winner. The winner is sworn into office in January on schedule. These events occurring as expected is the best outcome for the 2020 presidential election. I‚Äôm optimistic. The United States has had plenty of presidential elections. This particular election will be the most scrutinized election in history to date, I expect. Any hint of trouble and someone will be suing someone else. Love it or hate it, we do have a functioning judiciary and election controversies will be heard and resolved. Like most people, I have concerns about the future of our country. I believe that two of our national institutions ‚Äî our federal government and our mass media ‚Äî are failing us and are ripe for reform. For starters I do not want national discourse or public media to be governed by Facebook, Twitter, or any other social media. Most of our national media have aligned with the ‚Äúleft‚Äù and when it should be balanced and impartial ‚Äî which the economics of media are preventing. In particular, I think there should be real consequences for how The NY Times and WashPost covered Trump, FBI, Russian disinformation, Carter Page, etc. I think FoxNews is turning itself into a sewer, and CNN hasn‚Äôt covered news in years with its ever revolving panel of talking heads and pharma commercials. Regarding our federal government, I don‚Äôt think our elected officials are ‚Äúin-sync‚Äú with their constituents. This does not mean I believe our structure of government is at fault. Rather, I think it is time for our 50 states to vote to call for a constitutional convention. I expect that even the threat of one will cajole a recalcitrant group of senators and House reps to unify around reforms to our constitutional government that would curry favor with people ‚Äî for instance, we might consider lengthening the term of office for a senator to 12 years while prohibiting senators from seeking re-election. We might also consider lengthening the term of office for a House member from 2 years to 4 years and impose term limits. There are probably changes needed for the Supreme Court. Maybe we should question the constitutionality of the senate filibuster, and review whether specific areas of law reserved for legislation by the federal government are the right ones. Our electoral college system may also need reform. Although I consider myself to be more ‚Äúoriginalist‚Äù in the way I think the constitution should be interpreted, I also think revisions to the constitution should be more practical to achieve in a person‚Äôs lifetime. Our government exists by the consent of the governed, not for its own means, and it would be healthy as a nation if we reminded those in federal office that our ‚Äúconsent‚Äù can be revoked and that ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù aren‚Äôt consenting to a lot these days. Regarding Trump vs Biden, I‚Äôm not sure I care who the winner is much. I expect I have already made my decision, and I‚Äôm not convinced it is the most important vote on my Florida ballot come October when it arrives in the mail. I don‚Äôt want a weak president, and unfortunately both candidates are weak ‚Äî but for very different reasons. For me, it‚Äôs like picking between Coke and Pepsi when I don‚Äôt want to drink soda.",https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possible-good-outcome-for-the-2020-presidential-election,"Yeah! I would agree that we‚Äôre just going to have to go with the election regardless of who wins. Although, I could tell you that there will be a lot of arguments and fighting, but I don‚Äôt think it will cause a civil war or anything the last time I checked the news. Unless something does happen, then we will have to see about that. I feel like the best thing to do right now is to be well prepared rather than predict events because we can‚Äôt tell what will happen in the future with all that‚Äôs been going on since the beginning of 2020. However, it is more important to be healthy and safe (physically and mentally) during these unusual times. Hope that helps!",,,,
Presidential Election,US Presidential Election: Why didn‚Äôt 43% of the people vote in the US 2016 presidential election?,"A big part of the reason is human psychology. If a person votes, and it turns out badly, a human bean will feel worse than if it had not voted at all. Since the media almost always do significant negative reporting on winners, the tendency is reinforced. I‚Äôve seen it argued that the elites of both parties have a vested interest in low voter turnout for multiple reasons: 1) logistical‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to manage a smaller group; 2) loyalty‚Äîthe elites are happy with a system were there‚Äôs little change (check out the recidivism rate for Congressional candidates.) A largely electorate will be more volatile. The media have a vested interest in low turnout. It makes their jobs easier is multiple ways. Reporting. I worked as an Election Judge this year. The turnout was very heavy until shortly after noon. I assume the reports of exit polls caused many people not to vote. Futility. Between Gerrymandering and the Electoral College many people think that voting is futile. (I think that way myself sometimes, but I usually vote anyway.) BTW fixing the Electoral College is more difficult than most knowledgeable people think.

Presidential Election,Can Donald Trump realistically defeat Hillary Clinton in 2016?,"One theory of what is going on here is that the alliance between traditional fiscally conservative Republicans and socially conservative ones is getting more and more frayed.   With the socially conservative core gaining power within the Party, this has resulted in candidates having to appease the more extreme right elements during primary season (as well as mid-term elections) in order to win.  However, this actually makes it harder for those candidates to subsequently win a general election with its higher and broader voter turnouts.  Meanwhile, the relentless march of Demographics ups the ante every election because newly registered voters tend to be a shade browner or more yellow than before and they tend to care less about fighting against abortion and gay marriage and more about issues like immigration reform and rising inequality. Demographics have been working against the Republican Party for the last two decades.   Notably, this is a reversal from the prior two decades (70s and 80s) when internal immigration to and higher population growth in the Sunbelt and Southern states shifted electoral counts in their favor.  Some traditional Republican strongholds (e.g. Virginia, Colorado) have flipped Purple and are likely to continue getting more Blue over time. The tactical response by the Republican Party has been to ""rally"" the core which means getting a higher percentage of it to come out and vote.  And the core of the party is increasingly made up of social conservatives -- the ones who seem to really care about social issues like abortion, gay rights and immigration.  This strategy works really well in mid-term and Primary elections when voter turnouts are lower.  In general elections, this strategy worked in 2000 and again in 2004 but by 2008 it cracked and by the time this year's election rolls around, it will be even harder to implement. The Republican Party has essentially been taken over by its more extreme elements.   We saw the first rumblings of this shortly after President Obama won the general election with the rise of the Tea Party faction and its strong showing at the mid-term elections in 2010.  The Tea Party faction gained further momentum in subsequent elections, leading to Republican control of both the House and Senate.  The shellacking that leading ""Establishment"" candidate Jeb Bush took was the most recent evidence of this shift in power. However, I also believe that  the shift in power to the more extreme elements of the Party also has the effect of driving away traditional Republican voters.   For example, many of my Republican friends are having a hard time dealing with the more socially conservative elements of the Party's platform.  While this makes it easier for Tea Party or extreme candidates to win in Party primaries and caucuses, it actually makes it harder to win in the general election where you need broad-based support. Donald Trump has done a masterful job catering to the extreme right of the party, the ones who are now in control.  At times it seems like he is really randomly picking conservative sound bytes and mashing them together Ad Libs style (double the effect??) like when he blamed the Climate Change movement on the Chinese.  I am pretty sure he doesn't actually believe in a lot the stuff that comes out of his mouth (although as others have noted, this is by no means a justification for it). If Trump wins the party nomination, he is likely to (try to) pick an Establishment candidate in an attempt to consolidate remaining traditional Republican voters.  Given how far right he's had to go during the Primaries, he will then have to make an enormous shift towards the center and I am not sure how he is going to do that. Due to the divisiveness of the Republican primary battle thus far, there is an incredible amount of cannon fodder to attack him on.  He has said some really troubling things during his campaign which is scaring a lot of Democrats and even many mainstream Republicans -- and this anti-Trump fear will drive them to the polls in November to do their part in preventing such a thing from ever happening. So in my humble opinion, most likely Trump would lose in a general election.   And I think that if he loses particularly badly, there's a good chance that the Republican Party will seriously re-assess its strategy and core platform.  Specifically, it needs to start being more thoughtful on issues that minorities care about, like Immigration Reform.  It would be the biggest shake-up in the Party since the  defection of the Southern Democrats  in the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement.  And I think that would be a good thing for this country.  Our adversarial political system will only work if both sides are open to compromise. That said, anything can happen in the general election.  The global economy could tank, there could be another geopolitical event that shifts the issues, or (God forbid) there could be health-related setbacks amongst the candidates.  So while I honestly could not foresee a scenario where I am watching a President Trump give the State of the Union address in 2017, the chances have definitely increased in recent months.   I still think the chances of Trump winning a general election are very low, although not quite low enough to fully prevent this increasing sense of discomfort in my stomach.",https://www.quora.com/Can-Donald-Trump-realistically-defeat-Hillary-Clinton-in-2016,"A lot of your opinions are born out by more comprehensive analysis, but I would add there's more to worry about. Americans by and large don't vote. Even in a general election the turn out is an abysmal percentage not only of voting age individuals, but those actually registered to vote. Something like a 1/3 will vote for the Republican candidate no matter what. An equal percentage will vote Democrat no matter what. The remaining group decides the election...and the usually don't vote. The strategy pioneered by Carl Rove was to energize your base while making the otherside and undecided voters not excited about their candidate through endless smear campaigns. If you can reliably get 30% out while reducing the otherside and moderate supporters to  20%, you're golden. Even if you won with less than half of eligible voters turning out, a win is a win. The incredible lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is a major worry for those not happy about Trump. The hope is that enough people in the middle are so horrified by that prospect they will turn out in large numbers to vote for Clinton. But that is not guaranteed.","To be honest it is very interesting to watch trump. I think once he wins the primaries, which seems likely, he will definitely turn more to the centre. Remember that he was a Democrat before. So he is surely more liberal than most republicans.  And for trump, turning to the centre would not be difficult. He has the knack to say outrageous things and get accepted. He will say things which   can really be accepted and just get more liberals on his side. ","The most interesting theory I've seen is that Trump may split the Democratic vote. Many conservative Republicans and evangelical Christians say they cannot in good conscience vote for Donald Trump. Assuming he gets the party nomination, he will then dance to the middle. What we have seen him doing up to this point is campaigning for the party nomination. His game plan will change and he will begin to attack Clinton as he runs in the general election. That happens every election cycle; the Republicans are farther right and the Democrats are farther left during the nomination process, and both will move toward the center between convention and election time. Trump isn't really that far right to begin with; that's the arguments among hardline conservatives. His path to the White House may involve attracting former Bernie Sanders supporters. Fair or not there are voters, from both parties and independents, that will not for a female candidate.   Bottom line: Trump can beat Clinton in the general election, but it will take 40% of Republican voters plus another 11% of Democratic defectors to make it happen.  ","I am in the ""extreme right"" of the GOP and Mr. Trump does not appeal to me. It is possible I will vote for him in the general election, but probably not.",

Presidential Election,What was the most interesting Presidential election in the United States?,"Dart in the air, so many good ones, lands on‚Ä¶ 1884. Couple of reasons. For one, it was pretty intense because there had been one of the biggest two party droughts in the White House. Democrats were out of the White House for 24 years, from 1861 to 1885, not to be matched (the GOP drought of 20 years 1933‚Äì53 comes closest). It was not clear that post Civil War, the Democratic Party could even take the White House again. Stakes are high. To try to do that, the ultimate swing state was New York. This is because Democrats had the South, as well as Borders like Kentucky, Missouri and Delaware. They had a shot at Indiana and New Jersey. But they had very little chance in GOP New England or GOP-locked Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin, where the post-Civil War GOP dominated and the ‚Äòbloody shirt‚Äô - the remembrance of the Civil War and Union pride, hurt Democrats in elections. So New York, the center of America‚Äôs population at the time - nearly 10% of America‚Äôs electoral votes then (5% now) would would turn the switch for Democrats. But there was a twist - the reason New York could be competitive for Democrats was that Tammany Hall controlled the city elections in the state with a huge surplus of Irish-American voters. Boss Tweed was dead and long removed from the post, but the Sachem went on. That was great, but had a bad side - if Tammany was for a candidate, they  had the negatives of being the Boss Candidate.  That would hurt in the rest of the nation and the rest of the state, and the newspapers, the MSM of their day, would Tammany-shame a candidate if they were picked by TM. No matter. In 1884, National Democrats had a secret weapon,  the newly elected Governor of New York, Grover Cleveland. Four years earlier, he had been a sheriff. But he had a great reputation for honesty. And he had bucked his own New York Democratic party -he was no friend of the corrupt Tammany Hall - to win his nomination, and could reach out to Republicans. This was not a bad idea, because a lot of Republicans were mild about the candidate, James Blaine, former Speaker of the House, and in the view of many, bought and sold by the railroads. In Blaine, the GOP had a candidate who wasn‚Äôt sure he really wanted the job, but moreover, didn‚Äôt think the GOP had a chance. The party had taken a bath in the 1882 midterms. There was a lot of infighting. Blaine‚Äôs history of allegedly taking bribes for currying favor from a big railroad company for favors in Congress. No matter, the scandal was a dozen years old and the records were burned in a fire. Except, and we get to our first surprise of the election‚Ä¶ Well, a Presidential election does amazing things, the records on Blaine were found again. Not quite a smoking gun but enough to cast doubt on him. And now he was running against a Democrat who could both lock up the South, and win New York, and do it without having the stink of Tammany Hall on him. A Democrat that many Republican Mugwumps would vote for. What to do against Grover the Good? Well, the answer was,  go after him personally.  And thus you had an election focused not on the public behavior, where he was unassailable, but on the personal character of Cleveland. And we go to our second surprise of 1884. It started out with Cleveland talking out loud on a train and train employees at that time were routinely carrying people of both parties. Somebody heard Cleveland say he had some trouble with a woman in Buffalo, where he was from. It didn‚Äôt take long to find that Cleveland had long since been making payments to a woman named Maria Hapin for a baby that was either his or his law partner‚Äôs. Forget tariffs, forget taxes, forget silver and gold money. It was now about Cleveland‚Äôs sex life, and his morals. Ma, Ma Where‚Äôs my Pa? The cartoons went‚Ä¶  Cleveland wrote it off. He was not married, and frankly Miss Halpin and he had a consensual relationship and not one that was shared with several other bachelors. Nevertheless, newspapers spent a good deal of ink on the story. And there‚Äôs more - when they eventually found Halpin, she had a different take. In the  Chicago Tribune , she said ‚ÄúThe circumstances under which my ruin was accomplished are too revolting on the part of Grover Cleveland to be made public.‚Äù Halpin said that Cleveland had pursued her relentlessly, and that she finally consented to join him for a meal at the Ocean Dining Hall & Oyster House. After dinner, Cleveland escorted her back to her boarding house. In an 1874 affidavit, Halpin strongly implied that Cleveland‚Äôs entry into her room and the incident that transpired there was not consensual‚Äîhe was forceful and violent, she alleged, and later promised to ruin her if she went to the authorities. Democrats denied the story, but it certainly damaged Cleveland. The head of his hometown‚Äôs United Presbyterian Church, condemned Cleveland: I am very sorry to say that he is a corrupt, licentious man. He has never been married, and is notoriously bad with women. Cleveland is well known here, and it is a reproach to the city that he ever got into the Gubernatorial chair. I most sincerely and earnestly pray that he will not be our next President. Gosh. The star candidate of the Democrats might now be toast. Still the Democrats and the now nervous GOP converts could fire back plenty on Blaine as well. and they fired back. But the Cleveland scandal made the race much closer than expected, and gave Blaine new steam. The election would almost surely come down to Indiana and New York. And the final episode, as it is told is that at a New York rally, a Blaine supporter called the Democrats the party of ‚ÄúRum, Romanism and Rebellion.‚Äù Blaine didn‚Äôt say it, a supporter did, but he didn‚Äôt hear it or didn‚Äôt condemn it if he did. Nothing wrong with rum or rebellion really. Attacks on rum may not be popular in New York, but attacking rebels was old hat in the Bloody shirt days of post-Civil War politics. But Romanism? Now Blaine had angered the Irish in the city. And if Tammany wasn‚Äôt enthusiastic about Grover before, they were now‚Ä¶ Cleveland won New York and a close election. Whether the last RRR comments of the final days cost the election or not, I‚Äôm not sure.

Italian Restaurant,What is the meal I can have at an Italian restaurant that is under 500 calories?,"There is really nothing you can't order at an Italian restaurant regardless of the caloric restriction you choose to impose.

Or order  Osso Bucco Milanese  and eat two thirds of the serving, or... whatever. Restaurants have their own self-determined portion sizes. If you want to restrict calories,  then just choose to consume part of a meal instead of the whole of it!

Fashion 2022,The Georgia Senate Runoff cost $1 billion and was 'won' by Stacey Abrams and others with $5 mil on voter registration just like Trump had a great 'ground game' and almost won. Why don't political parties stop wasting TV billions and focus on people?,"Now that the Trump impeachment train is gone forever, we are at the boring time in politics. Way to early to think about 2022, after all 2020 seemed to last forever in every bad way possible. How about a vaccination campaign and a summer of fun! Or at least a summer, any kind of summer.  Come on Stacey tell Jaime what to do, I am sure he is listening. But the progressives are all over the place in the Democratic party and they are out for blood. AOC has been on the attack as always, taking on Steve Schmidt and the Lincoln Project saying they wasted money. Thanks AOC, we can always count on you ticking off free help that is trying to make sure the voting laws are NOT changed against Democrats and sucked up a lot of air time away from Republicans embarrassing them along the way. How many votes did they really bring in? Ah, now that is the question. The numbers are in and this question hits the nail on the head. TV ADS, CORPORATE MONEY, BIG DONORS ARE ALL OVER BOTH PARTIES AND NO ONE IS WATCHING, NO ONE CARES AND IT DOESN‚ÄôT BRING IN VOTES. IT IS JUST MONEY FOR THE ELITES AND NO ONE ELSE, NOT FOR THE VOLUNTEERS, NOT FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON, NOT EVEN HARDLY A TRICKLE FOR THOSE WHO REALLY DO THE WORK, THE ON THE GROUND FOLKS WHO WENT OUT AND GOT IT DONE IN GEORGIA AND EVERY OTHER ‚ÄòSWING STATE‚Äô. Wow, news flash, Stacey Abrams and her friends on $5 million registered an extra 300,000 voters for the GA runoff and with a full unrestricted by Covid good old fashioned ‚Äòground game‚Äô they did the impossible. They took 2 marginal candidates, both of whom were practically unknown and took them to the US Senate in a red state in a stand alone runoff where the Democrats had lost 7 out of 8 runoffs in Georgia in recent years. So what are the Democrats doing about this? They brought in nice guy loser Jaime Harrison who just got crushed by Lyndsey Graham to be DNC chair to figure out what is right in front of him. GROUND GAME because if you don‚Äôt have it, all the new voter ID and other restrictions, plus restricted mail in ballots, absentee ballot cutbacks. You name it, the Republicans have been hard at work in GA and every other ‚Äòswing‚Äô state already to make sure that the Democrats ‚Äòground game‚Äô is blunted before they even get started. So this answer is about alerting and pushing and putting it out there front and center, the DEMOCRATS DO NOT NEED CORPORATE DONORS FOR TV OR OTHER ADS, THEY NEED MONEY TO FIGHT LEGAL BATTLES ON VOTER SUPPRESSION AND MOST OF ALL THEY JUST NEED IT TO PAY THE 10‚ÄôS OF THOUSANDS OF VOLUNTEERS TO KEEP UP THE VOTER REGISTRATIONS. Not in 2022, not in the summer of that year just before the election, they do it now. So if there are challenges to a voter, they sort it out now so there are no issues. Republicans just lost and from the moment they lost they have been just like Trump except they haven‚Äôt tried to steal the 2020 election they lost that, they are trying to steal the 2022 and 2024 elections. Like through delaying the census so no time to check on those gerrymandered districts so they just sail through for one cycle and boom they are back in power. Why? Because Republicans control 26 state houses including most of the ‚Äòswing‚Äô states and states like Texas may pick up as many as 3 electoral votes. You getting this Jamie? The last loser in that job was Tom Perez who was at least benign and not the cancer of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz who continues to lead the Dem party of Florida into oblivion.

Presidential Election,Is the 2020 presidential election shaping up to be a massive electoral landslide victory?,"A2A I was asked a couple of weeks ago what I thought that the final EV total would be. I took a guess that Joe Biden (D-DE) was going to win in the College by 318‚Äì220. In the interim, President Trump had an awful ‚Äòdebate‚Äô performance, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, flouted various conventions around quarantine, and generally has made a bad situation for himself worse. I guess that he is in real danger to lose North Carolina (15) and Ohio (18), as well as NE-2 and ME-2, each giving Biden one more EV. So if these dominos also topple to Biden (something even two weeks ago that seemed very unlikely), that would add 35 more for the former VEEP. So that would be 353‚Äì185. Is that a ‚Äúlandslide?‚Äù President Obama in 2008 defeated John McCain by 365‚Äì173, and that was a pretty good beating. Biden would not quite match  that , but it would still be a pretty good ass-whipping. He might reach it, but I suggest it‚Äôs unlikely. Bill Clinton in 1996 was re-elected by a margin of 379‚Äì159, as well as a 9% total vote margin (49.2% vs 40.7% against Bob Dole). Biden is very unlikely to match that. In my lifetime, the pace-setter for defeat was Walter Mondale in 1984. He lost to incumbent Republican Ronald Reagan 525‚Äì13. Mondale won only the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota. And he  barely  won in Minnesota.

Fashion 2022,Could Macron lose to Le Pen?," (French politics today. Not much else to see really) Very, very, very unlikely. Why, let us see the situation Macron is in these days: He has become very unpopular due to his slaughtering of the social services and his pandering to the oligarchs. The vague hope that he might maybe end up somewhat socially liberal has died long ago. In practice, Macron‚Äôs politics are very close to that of the center right (micro) party LR, which used to be one of the two largest parties in France until fairly recently. This LR party is thus split between those who actually agree with Macron (even if they don‚Äôt admit it or openly support it) and those who are actually closer to the anti-immigrant RN party of LePen. Macron, has, as such, a center-right base. He nevertheless came from the center left Socialist party and literally vampirized the sh*t outa it, to the point where now the center-left has turned into two minuscule micro-micro parties that are even less relevant than the LR now. Macron has two real adversaries: M√©lenchon (Far left) and LePen (Far right). The thing though, is that these three poles of the French political life cannot stand each other and would never truly support any of the other. Macron is the representative of the rich, the neolibs, the upper middle class, the urban elites, those who don‚Äôt want to radically change the status quo, just chip a bit more at the state and get fatter and richer in the process. M√©lenchon is the representative of the immigrants, muslims, open-border activists, old-school anti capitalists, third-worldists and anti-americans. These people want to destroy the status quo and champion the religious and ethnic minorities, as well as establish a more domineering social protection system. LePen is the representative of the poor whites, rural people, social conservative folks, xenophobes, chauvinists, anti immigration and anti-islam activists. They want to break the status quo and limit the influence of islam and non-white people in the country as well as focus on internal security and national interests.  ( these people will NOT vote for Macron, but for who then? ) You would not be able to see more different political currents really. There is a little peripheral overlap at the margins, mostly through irrelevant micro-parties that are maybe a bit split between two of the three major currents but it is very limited. If I were to guess, I would think that the country is probably split 25% mostly pr-Macron people, 25% mostly pro M√©lenchon, 25% mostly pro LePen and 25% people who are so fed up they don‚Äôt really think that voting makes any difference. In this situation, voters most often vote AGAINST another party/current/politician rather than for their own, as each of these three currents are actually facing quite a bit of internal strife: Macron‚Äôs movement has elements that are quite pro-immigration, pro-islam, and other that are less enthusiastic about the growing power of the religion in the public sphere, and who want to show a stronger resolve against illegal immigration. M√©lenchon‚Äôs movement is split between the more race obsessed Ideology-politics activist ‚ÄúIndigenist‚Äù faction, which always supports islam, non-white populations etc‚Ä¶ and an older, whiter demographics that stems from communism and which is more into class-theory and anti-religion. LePen‚Äôs movement has people that are in favor of strong cultural integration for the extra-europeans dwellers of France and an acute focus on internal security, and others who simply see anything that is not white as a potential threat and want most them shipped out of the country. In addition, a more socially-conservative movement, inspired by catholicism is becoming increasingly at odds against a maybe younger generation for whom traditional religion, and the social order it supports, does not matter much at all. Basically, whoever can keep its own camp from splitting too openly, all the while making the other camp appear like an unthinkable alternative, will win. At the moment, M√©lenchon is clearly in third place. Not only because of his party splitting apart, but because of a series of controversies that has tarnished his image. LePen has also lost a lot of her momentum since she utterly failed against Macron, and while the president is as unpopular as ever, he, in many ways, represents a certain idea of stability and power that some find reassuring in these trying times. Still, a lot of erstwhile Macron‚Äôs supporters have probably abandoned him for good, because of his egregious assault on the popular class and the French social system. Maybe these people will end up voting for LePen or M√©lenchon? Unlikely. They will probably vote for some insignificant micro-party. That or the rapidly growing Green party, which seems to have become a bit of a left-wing joker-card as of late. If France was a parliamentary democracy, a broad left-wing alliance with M√©lenchon, the greens, and whichever insignificant micro party there is left could actually seriously threaten Macron.  ( the little green man, who grows‚Ä¶ ) But France is a presidential monarchy. What counts is becoming president, and M√©lenchon is too divisive to get all the left to support him. He most likely will never get anywhere, unfortunately for him. This leave LePen. She got to the second turn of the presidential election, and will likely do it again, but in 2017 she only gained a very small amount of voters compared to her first round results. She might get a little bit more next time, but considering that Macron will have his own base to support him + the adjacent micro-parties supporters who are actually kinda ok with him + others who still see LePen and her party as literal Waffen SS ready to genocide anything browner than fresh snow, he will probably be able to get more extra votes on the second round, and win. Still, it could be quite tighter compared to 2017. Macron has still lost a lot of goodwill, and many people will probably not care about him anymore and simply not vote for anyone. I expect abstention to be at record high in 2022. Maybe we could see something like 42% Le Pen vs 57% Macron? That would still count as a victory, but Macron‚Äôs ideology would be allowed to reign supreme for a couple more years. LePen would likely face so much ridicule she might have to leave the party, and this might lead to a split, and weakening of the Far Right faction. Add this the demographical changes currently experienced by France, and this 2022 election might just mark the death of LePen‚Äôs National Gathering, and French far right in general. Whatever happens, it is certain to be, in perfect French fashion, quite dramatic.  (a truthful representation of France - and France politics- in the upcoming years)",https://www.quora.com/Could-Macron-lose-to-Le-Pen,"They will probably vote for some insignificant micro-party.

Otherwise, an excellent introduction to the present mess. I especially like your description of the Greens as the ‚Äúleft-wing wild card‚Äù, which explains why they have managed to survive their internal strifes, even though they are both the most stupid party in France, and the most stupid Green party in Europe.","M√©lenchon is the representative of the immigrants, muslims, open-border activists, old-school anti capitalists, third-worldists and anti-americans.

Current polls‚Äîand French polls tend to be more accurate based on past elections‚Äîshow that that Le Pen is slightly ahead of Macron, and Melenchon is quite insignificant. Since the situation with Muslims and immigration and social situation is getting only worse (gilets jaunes e.g.), and Macron will never improve it, I suspect that Le Pen has a chance‚Äîand will prepare to the 2nd round debates much better than the last time. Her poor preparation to debates was the main reason of her fluke, if I understand correctly. I can assure that only the city elite, which hates her, ridicules her. For many desperate people, she is the only hope, and they will vote 100%.","You do realize that the RN appeals to young voters just as much, if not more, than the FI? You do realize that there are more right-wing voters, at present, in France? I would link you an answer on the French Quora, if I didn‚Äôt think it was disallowed. You also realize that the latest sondages show Macron winning with only 52%? And, lastly, you do realize that Macron is quite pro-la√Øcit√©, which you tend to describe as anti-Islam, right? Have you not seen the showdown between him and Erdogan/Muslim World? As for Macron being pro-oligarch, that‚Äôs really just a far-left talking point. Any objective observer would see him as fighting to have France adopt a more Nordic-style model. He too sees the challenges of globalization but, unlike his populist adversaries, doesn‚Äôt think that inward-looking nationalism will fix the problem. He‚Äôs also very much socially liberal, unlike LR. Only the pro-business LR voters joined him. The rest are either still with LR or have joined RN (Even if a good chunk of its voters are disgruntled ex-PS voters). And before I forget, Muslims aren‚Äôt the core demographic when it comes to LFI voters. In fact, as many voted for Macron and Fillon in 2017 and quite a bit voted for the RN."
Fashion 2022,"Should I quit machine learning? I used to find it exciting before it was cool, but now I find it unexciting and boring. Since deep learning is the future, should anyone with no interest in deep learning quit?","Things always come and go. DL is super hot right now, has been hot since mid 2012, but it‚Äôs not necessarily the case that it will still be the center of ML in, say, 2022 or 2032. About ten years ago, ‚ÄúBayesian‚Äù was the previous buzz word which many claimed to be the ‚Äúfuture of ML‚Äù; people like Michael Jordan et al were drawing ‚Äúplate diagrams‚Äù all over the world, injecting their over-complicated ‚Äúpriors‚Äù into people‚Äôs minds (well, I never believed those stuff, and I rejected every single applicant if s/he said s/he wanted to work on ‚ÄúBayesian‚Äù just because it sounded ‚Äúcool‚Äù. I just don‚Äôt like people who like trendy stuff; I prefer people who believe in deeper, non-trendy, stuff). These hypes all faded away pretty quickly. DL, however, is nothing like ‚ÄúBayesian‚Äù. It is much more fundamental (though not necessarily ‚Äúdeeper‚Äù, see below), and has brought a much more serious change to ML and AI in general. So obviously DL has stayed and will stay much longer than the short-lived ‚ÄúBayesian‚Äù hype. But even neural net itself was kinda a taboo word in the 90s and early 2000s when the center stage of ML was occupied by SVMs and graphical models. Students were not allowed to work on NN in many universities around the world. As a side story, when I was interviewing for a faculty job at CMU just before DL really took off, we were discussing over the dinner about the new buzz word ‚Äúdeep learning‚Äù, and one CMU professor (let‚Äôs call him prof. A) cried, ‚Äúc‚Äômon it‚Äôs just neural nets!!‚Äù, and other professors, including myself, all cheerfully agreed (well, I still believe ‚Äúit‚Äôs just neural nets‚Äù today, and like many colleagues, I am ethically against the unethical rebranding of NN as ‚ÄúDL‚Äù since there is nothing ‚Äúdeep‚Äù there. As known to all, ‚ÄúDL‚Äù sounds way too offensive to anybody who works on the more theoretical or structured areas in AI, including NLP and structured prediction. The fact I use the term ‚ÄúDL‚Äù doesn‚Äôt suggest my approval of it. I personally prefer to call DL ‚Äúshallow models‚Äù instead). Today, however, everybody on that dinner table has had (at least quite a few) DL publications; interestingly, prof. A himself, being the most productive among us, wrote way more DL papers than everybody else combined. During the long ‚ÄúNN winter‚Äù, very few people kept working on it, not even Hinton himself, but Schmidhuber and Lecun, among a few others, persisted. And for this reason I think Schmidhuber is probably the most underrated ML researcher. He deserves the same status as Hinton, Bengio, and LeCun. The history is not what Bengio et al claimed, ‚Äúwe are the first three labs that took the deep learning approach, soon followed by Andrew Ng at Stanford and others‚Ä¶‚Äù The real history is that Schmidhuber kept working on what is now called DL and made one of the two most important contributions in it (the other being LeCun‚Äôs CNN) 15 years before DL finally took off. Interestingly, the same story happened to statistical machine translation. After the groundbreaking IBM 1990 paper first came out, people were excited about it, but that excitement soon faded away, after Renaissance bought the whole group and IBM stopped MT research. During the mid-late 1990s a very small number of people persisted, including most notably Dekai Wu of HKUST and Hermann Ney of Aachen, followed by Kevin Knight of USC/ISI. When statistical MT came back and took off around 2003, these three people soon became some of the most cited people in NLP, when people dig up their old work done in the ‚ÄúSMT winter‚Äù, just like people are digging up Schmidhuber‚Äôs old work done in the ‚ÄúNN winter‚Äù like crazy. These pioneers deserve the recognition because they were way ahead of time; they kept working on what they believed in during a time when the majority follows the trend. Now that DL is in fashion and other parts of ML (such as structured prediction) are slightly out of fashion, it is, in my opinion, exactly the best time to believe in yourself, keep working on what you believe in, and if you are lucky, become the next Schmidhuber or the next Dekai Wu. One side note though: ML has been different now because of DL. So even if you don‚Äôt work in DL or don‚Äôt believe in it, you should consider updating your arsenal with DL tools, as the other answers also suggested. Another personal footnote: when I had my first paper with one of the pioneers above, Kevin Knight (and with Hao Zhang and Dan Gildea), the reviews were generally positive except for one; and I said to Kevin, ‚Äúthat reviewer probably just didn‚Äôt understand it because our work is ahead of time‚Äù, to which Kevin responded, ‚ÄúNo, we were not. It was Dekai Wu who was 10 years ahead of time!‚Äù I immediately realized that he was absolutely right. [for those of you not in NLP, Kevin was referring to the 10 year gap between the original ITG (Wu, 1995; 1997) and its award-winning and groundbreaking modernization ‚ÄúHiero‚Äù (Chiang, 2005; 2007) which changed the whole field. Even today, many people in NLP, including myself, strongly believe that Chiang (2005) is, and will probably still be for a long time, the single most beautifully written conference paper in the entire ACL history, and that Chiang (2007) is one of the most elegantly written journal papers in CL. But it was Wu (IJCAI 1995; CL 1997) that was more original, although it was obscure during the SMT Winter, being cited ~3 times per year (including, ironically, many self-citations) in that 10-year gap. In other words, ITG was more or less obscure back then, but suddenly came to the center stage in 2005 out of nowhere thanks to David‚Äôs groundbreaking work, a little like LSTM suddenly became the focus on ML out of nowhere 10+ years after its publication.] Historical footnote: actually there have been many other ‚Äúwinters‚Äù in the histories of both NN and MT. The specific ‚ÄúNN winter (c. 1994‚Äì2005)‚Äù and ‚ÄúSMT winter (c. 1993‚Äì2002)‚Äù referred to in my answer above were the most recent ones in those two areas, respectively.

Fashion 2022,What will software engineering be like in 2022?,"While some of other answers are funny and/or cynical, I will try to take a more serious tone. The proliferation of languages and frameworks makes it unnecessarily difficult to choose a technology stack and makes it unnecessarily difficult for developers to choose which skills to learn. This is not good for the industry. There will be consolidation around frameworks and libraries. We have seen too many slightly different variations of the wheel being invented. Innovation would be better focused on improving and extending a few major frameworks and libraries (for example, React and Angular in the Web space) than writing new ones. There will be consolidation around languages. We don‚Äôt really need more than two variations on JVM languages, for example. My picks would be regular Java and Scala. Tried and true software engineering practices like type safety will come back into fashion because they actually help when building large software systems. This implies that TypeScript will overtake plain-old JavaScript in serious Web development and, hopefully, Scala or some other language with stronger typing and support for both OO and functional paradigms will overtake Python and R in AI and Big Data. Unless some latter-day Dijkstra or Knuth comes out of nowhere, there will be no revolution or paradigm shift, just evolution, over a five-year horizon.

Presidential Election,Which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the US presidential election in 2016?,"It's hard to say.  One reason for this is the two-part process of becoming president.  To win the primary you have to alienate the moderates, to win the general you have to alienate your base.  Another reason is the huge number of Republican candidates.  Jeb Bush is the obvious choice for front-runner.  But he's been having some problems.  His answers on what he would have done about invading Iraq were problematic and in his announcement speech he rather oddly said that one thing that was unusual (and presumably good) about the USA is that the son and brother of a president could be running for president.
There has been some polling, both national and by state.  Nationwide polling has shown no clear favorite.  In the most recent national poll (by The Economist) Ben Carson (!) and Marco Rubio tied for first with 10%. Rand Paul got 9% and Bush got 8%.   But other polls done in May or June have shown a wide variety of winners: Bush, Walker, Rubio, Paul and Carson have all either led or tied for the lead.  Of course, the primaries aren't national, they are state by state.  In early states: Iowa: Walker has led all recent polls.  Rubio has been 2nd or 3rd in all of them as well.  New Hampshire:  Bush has led most polls; in the most recent poll, his lead was substantial.  South Carolina hasn't been polled since April.  Walker and Bush have led in recent polls.  But all the above is only as of June 19, 2015.  Fasten your seat belts. It's going to be a bumpy flight. Then, of course, there's the general.  Assuming Clinton wins the Democratic nomination.  In recent nationwide polls, Clinton beats all the Republicans.  Of the serious candidates, the best Republican contenders seem to be Paul and Rubio, but there's a lot of variation.",https://www.quora.com/Which-Republican-candidate-has-the-best-chance-of-winning-the-US-presidential-election-in-2016,"I suspect the current/pending cycle of Clinton Derangement Syndrome, as well as Hilary' problematic image as a corporatist will render any race as close as any recent races (if she does indeed win the Democratic nomination).

Presidential Election,Could Condoleezza Rice win the 2016 presidential election in the USA?,"No. Dr. Rice certainly won't run; but if she did, she certainly couldn't win.

First, her views on domestic issues do not necessary coincide with the dominant views of the Republican Party. So long as her portfolio was limited to foreign policy, there was no reason to question her on abortion or affirmative action or marriage equality or anything else. Once Dr. Rice starts answering those question, her support in the Republican Party would diminish.

Second, Dr. Rice has never ever run for public office. Most Presidential candidates have had the opportunity to make mistakes in speeches, off the cuff remarks, in staffing, etc. in races for the state legislature or a congressional district, when the national media is not watching. As a national candidate, she would be under an intense spotlight.

Third, most Americans have come to regard the invasion of Iraq as a terrible mistake. Considering the level of chaos in that part of the world, it could be argued that the US would have been better off with Saddam in charge today rather than ISIS. Dr. Rice was an advocate of that war and, to the best of my knowledge, has never acknowledged that the invasion was a poor policy decision, perhaps the worst since Viet Nam.

Fourth, it may be unfair...Hell it IS unfair, but as a Presidential candidate, Dr. Rice would lose any claim to privacy.  I wish this wasn't a part of the process, but it is, and she might not want to make her private life a public spectacle.",https://www.quora.com/Could-Condoleezza-Rice-win-the-2016-presidential-election-in-the-USA,"Also, you're right.

Italian Restaurant,What is the best Italian restaurant in Boston's North End?,"This is a very subjective question. Everyone‚Äôs ‚Äúbest‚Äù is different. I believe, with all my heart, that for total experience, the very best restaurant in the North End is Mama Marias. Here‚Äôs why: they take reservations. Many restaurants in the North End require ‚Äúfirst come, first serve‚Äù and have long lines they take credit cards. Many North End restaurants only accept cash they have valet parking. Parking in the North End is an expensive, frustrating experience. Valet parking at Mama Maria‚Äôs at least removes the frustration of finding parking the restaurant is absolutely charming. Each room is tiny and decorated in old world Italian style. It‚Äôs almost like eating at someone‚Äôs house in Italy the staff is absolutely stellar. They are attentive without being intrusive, kind, helpful, and they know what they are doing the food is exceptional. this is the thing most people are interested in when they say ‚Äúbest‚Äù restaurant. I think Mama Maria‚Äôs provides the best food in the North End. Now, this is subjective. There are many people who will go to war and say Mesamino‚Äôs is the best, or Giacomos or L‚ÄôOsteria or someplace else. But this is my pick - and IT AINT CHEAP. Mama Marias is one of the places you go to propose or on your anniversary. You go there to impress. Other ‚Äúbest‚Äù restaurants I love: I‚Äôve never had a bad meal at Giacomo‚Äôs and it would be my go-to as second choice - but I have had many bad experiences there. The place is beyond crowded. There can be no intimate conversation with your partner - your elbow is in the pasta of the guy sitting next door and his date is mistakenly playing footsy with you. They don‚Äôt take reservations and the wait times are excessive. The bathroom is downstairs and hard to access. And worst of all there is no AC. If you want a great meal in a suffocating, wilting environment while crammed in with fifty sweating bodies on a hot summer night, then this is the place for you. It‚Äôs like being in a submarine during combat. However, if you go during the week when there are no lines then you are going to be treated to the best Italian menu in Boston with the most variations by wait staff that treat you like family and you can watch them make your food on gleaming copper before your very eyes. The food is outstanding; the prices are high; the ambience is dicey. I also tend to go to Carmelina‚Äôs. I do not think it is the best food but it is the best of all worlds. It‚Äôs right across the street from Cafe Vittoria. If it‚Äôs crowded, they give you a pager and you can have a cap and a shot across the street while you wait. The place is set up to never be too crowded so you can have an intimate meal. The waitresses are uniformly stunning with large breasts and tight dresses. The atmosphere is elegant and you can watch them prepare your food. The prices are less than Giacomos but it‚Äôs still ‚Äúcosta plente‚Äù.

Typical, mid-priced places will have good quality, fresh ingredients, which are mostly imported. Some of the cost of the meal will go towards the ambiance and decor. But the majority of Italian places are Mom and Pop restaurants. In my town, there is a place that has been family run for over 70 years. They have not updated the decor or the menu much in all those years either. They have great quality, generous portions, and reasonable prices. The least expensive are the pizza places that also serve entrees and appetizers. They frequently have takeout, and even delivery. The money they don‚Äôt spend on fancy plates, glassware and decor make them quite a bargain, Especially since the portions are usually so generous, you can pack up half your meal for lunch tomorrow.

Presidential Election,How does Justin Trudeau view Canada's relationship with the US in light of Donald Trump winning the US presidential election?,"As a Canadian PM, one of my most important jobs is managing the relationship with our southern neighbour. Our economy is massively intertwined and dependent upon theirs, so regardless of the political stripe of whomever sits in the Oval Office, any PM needs to have a constructive working relationship with the President. Obviously there‚Äôll always be areas of greater or lesser disagreement, as between any two countries or leaders, but there is no relationship in the world like the one between us. We enjoy the longest, most peaceful, and mutually beneficial relationship on the planet. Our partnership is based on common history, culture, shared environment and values. Donald Trump was elected on a promise to help the millions of middle-class families who feel left out of the success and progress of the past decades, and, interestingly enough, that is exactly the promise I got elected on, too. We may have different perspectives on solutions and even different ideologies, but I know that we can work together to ensure that we‚Äôre creating good jobs and opportunities for our citizens by working together on common issues. Millions of good jobs in Canada AND in the US depend on the smooth, secure flow of goods, services, and people back and forth across our shared border. Indeed, Canada is the top trading partner for most U.S. states, and more than $2.5 billion in two-way trade flows across our shared border every day. Overall, in regards to how I manage this relationship, I know that Canadians expect two things of me as PM. First, that I stand up for the values and principles that Canadians hold dear: things like equality, rights, openness, and compassion. And second, that I ensure good jobs and economic opportunities for Canadians, and that means building on the strong relationship while creating new successes with the US. I will stay focused on doing both those things.",https://quorasessionwithjustintrudeau.quora.com/How-does-Justin-Trudeau-view-Canadas-relationship-with-the-US-in-light-of-Donald-Trump-winning-the-US-presidential-elec,"That kinda feels like a non-answer, or at least such a standardized response that it could have been written by any politician, anywhere in the world, at any point during the last fifty years.

I just think that Trudeau could have taken the opportunity to say something worth reading. * various insults based on your unfounded assumptions about my political views, experience with and knowledge of politics*","I think this is a response that‚Äôa fairly clear. PM Trudeau is saying that the most important thing about the US-Canadian relationship is it's long history of friendliness and the open and fair trade of goods. NOT who is president. He recognizes he and Trump ran on similar platforms, but with very different ideas of how to solve the underlying issues. He isn't going to malign the US president because he has no reason to. (Yet.) Relations remain open and friendly, and he is treating Trump as he should as head Canadian diplomat: the official representation of a country with whom his country has a longstanding friendship. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm certain  Justin Trudeau  has too much experience being a leading politician focused on ensuring peace and prosperity for his citizenry to take cheap bait like this and irrationally antagonize a crucial ally - no matter how much we may want him to.

Presidential Election,"How statistically sound is Helmut Norpoth's ""primary model"" for predicting presidential election results?","That is a great question and one that deserves an honest answer of more than a ""yes"" or ""no"" or ""don't listen to him"" response. Empirically speaking, the methodology he applied is a non-partisan, unbiased, scientific, statistically sound, objective method to determine election outcomes. It's worth noting that when applied, his model calls correctly every election going back well over 100 years. While he has only applied it since 1996 when he built it, using it to look back on the presidential races prior to that yields perfect accuracy at determining the winner. The only exception he's had was in 2000. However, as it predicts popular vote and not electoral votes, his model still prevailed. Now, I'd like to address this and as other respondents who have cited polls or pollsters to basically dismiss Norpoth's model, I'd also like to address political polling in general. Unlike other types of polling, like identifying someone's favorite color or a brand of ice cream they prefer, political polling is very easily skewed by the bias of the person or organization conducting the poll, if it were not then the recent polls from various entities would be more consistent and wouldn't range from +12 for one candidate to -6 for the same candidate or vice versa for data collected in the same window. It's worth noting that regardless of the results, this year as in all years, one poll WILL in the end technically be the ""most accurate"". This fact does not necessarily mean its methodology was the most accurate as it could have instead simply ""got lucky"". In 2008 for example, Rasmussen was one of the most accurate polls yet in 2012 they weren't. Should we conclude then that their methodology changed in 4 years to skew their results so much? Very unlikely! In 2012 IBD was the most accurate but does that mean it will be again or that it too simply ""got lucky"" in 2012? Now, enter Nate Silver.... Everyone remembers the wonder-boy from 2008 who called the race and states for Obama. He did so basically by weighting poll results by state. While I'm not out to undercut the significance of what he did, logically speaking most of these races were called effortlessly and correctly by other models too, when's the last time California went for a GOP candidate or Alabama gone DEM? Still, giving him credit for 2012, the model worked again. Once again though his model is nothing overly complex, it's simply probabilities, weights and polling data. Using HIS model, the odds of a Clinton win are about 40bpts greater than a Trump win yet those odds are narrowing. Again, it relies on polls so, if the data is so badly skewed one way or the other, the model collapses....GIGO-Garbage in garbage out. If you weight or average garbage polls you don't get more accurate results, only garbage outcomes. The question then becomes is polling the best indicator of who will win? Everyone seems to think so and therefore they spend massive amounts on polling people. However, if presidential polling were the end-all be-all it once was, Gallup wouldn't have dropped out from doing so. For decades, Gallup was the ""gold standard"" for polling. They were way off though in 2012 though. Does that mean that their methodology was wrong? Did Gallup become an arm of the GOP in 2012? HIGHLY unlikely... What about the many elections prior to that when it got it right? Also, which of their polls should you use to determine their accuracy? Do you only count the one right before an election? Well, due to Sandy in 2012 many polling outfits suspended polling in areas impacted by the storm, what kind of impact did this have on the polling data? Yet the problems move on to other issues now as well, what about voter movement, undecideds becoming decideds, unaffiliated swinging from one to the other, etc.? How do you reach out to people? Home phone, cell phone, computer? What about people who don't accurately indicate their intention? Polling may be a science but the people being polled aren't fixed, the sample changes as do the minds of the voters as do the mix of the sample as do so many factors. This election proves that to be true now more than ever. Now add to that, the complexity of an election unlike any prior (in our lifetimes at least). You have two candidates that are polarizing and yet energizing among their select audiences but outside of that aren't highly favored (or at least not to the point people are willing to admit). Combine that with a 24/7 election news cycle, breaking sex scandals, 15 years old taped comments, an FBI investigation re-launch, pay for play, the DOJ shielding the subject of an investigation, Wikileaks, hackers, scandal, death an intrigue oh my! Here's the reality, the average of the polls have both candidates within 5 points in over a dozen states on any given day. So, statistically they are ""tied"" we'll say. There are however still wide margins between many of the polls with some favoring one candidate by 12 points and others showing the other candidate ahead by 6 points. Which one is the outlier? Yes, average them together and you get -3 for one candidate, +3 the other but what if the +6 was correct or MORE correct than the +12 of the other candidate? The average then is skewed yet still exists within the MOE of most polls‚Ä¶. Ironically, that's where many of the states are at today. Unless a candidate is polling an average of +15 or greater their probability of winning a state is not clearly established. Even then, it's possible (but not likely) to change it. Something tells me that those arguing against the Norpoth model are doing so more because of their bias against the result than the model itself. This is a dangerous path to wander down. Trust me, I'm not saying that the model will hold true this time, only that based upon the history of the model and its accuracy so far it's unlikely the model will fail. Someone earlier equated the model to being like a coin slightly biased to land on heads and because it's always worked prior to now that meant this time it would be less likely to do so‚Ä¶ However, what if that coin were biased such that it landed on heads, 86.00% -99.99% of the time? That increases the confidence in the outcome significantly more than an analogy of a coin that only lands on heads say 55.1% of the time, or whatever value, doesn't it? That's what we are dealing with in the Norpoth model. We can infer 86-99.99% accuracy because so far it's always worked! Yes, there's room for error and this might be the year in which that happens but it's unlikely to do so. So the question then becomes not so much IF the model works but HOW or WHY it likely works‚Ä¶ This is what I believe is core to any election. It's where the DNC spends massive amounts of money, GOTV Get out the vote‚Ä¶ You see, political polling fails to be able to properly account for voter enthusiasm and motivation to vote. Example, you call me up and ask who I like best, A or B and I pick A but in order to register my vote I must go and stand in line for half an hour or more and fill out a form, jump on one leg while touching my nose with my left hand, would I do it or simply stay home and watch The Walking Dead on Netflix? This is where polls fail. They assume that everyone being polled that fails to vote will do so in a balanced proportion across party lines which Norpoth argues isn't accurate. Who stands to lose or gain the most? How do I get there? Do I have to work? Do I REALLY like them THAT much? These are all motivating factors that polling cannot properly establish. So, take all of the predictions, roll them up in a ball and use them to light your first fireplace fire of the season because that's about as much as they are worth this year. Norpoth's model does what none of the polls can do, measures motivation.... It does so by examining how motivated people are to vote for their candidate. If they are very motivated, they show up in large numbers in the primaries and vote. If they aren't very motivated by their selections, then they stay home. This tends to have a direct relationship to turnout at the general election. Fewer people vote in the primary than in the general election, this is a fact. So, the more you have that show up in a primary, the greater the likelihood that same voting block or group is going to engage heavily in the general election. There are exceptions to this theory I'm sure but so far, the predictive value remains strong. Ironically, we are seeing this play out in early voting as demographics that voted very strongly in 2012 but were missing in the primary this year aren't showing up heavily in their early voting numbers. However, that too doesn't mean that they won't do so prior to or on Election Day. Democrats are famous, or infamous, for their GOTV efforts. So, is Norpoth's model accurate? Historically, it's perfectly accurate at predicting the winner of the POPULAR vote‚Ä¶ Could that change this year? Absolutely‚Ä¶ Is it likely? Truthfully, no‚Ä¶ Humans are given to patterns whether we notice them ourselves or not. Our current and future behavior can be predicted based upon our past behavior. Not only that but Silver's model is now starting to catch up and if one or two other states ""flip"" to Trump then the odds of Hillary winning fall dramatically. His model is about 5 very strong key polls for Trump away from being thrown into limbo. Before I get the rude remarks please understand I'M NOT SAYING IT WILL HAPPEN, only that one shouldn't look to Silver's model to predict a future outcome just yet. It's dynamic and as with all models, relies on the most accurate and recent data to make a firm prediction. Deprive it of accurate data and you deprive it of accurate results. Example, one state that holds the keys to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave is North Carolina. Once a solidly RED state, due to changing demographics, it's become a bit less red in the urban areas especially. Right now, while Silver has the state for Clinton, if you believe them, the most recent polls show it solidly for Trump. Moreover, contrary to the media, when you run the numbers for early voting, it's down about 200,000 (projected) from 2012. Deciding who a person registered as DEM will vote for there also is hard as they have a number of DEM's who vote REP in the general election. So, the DEM voter rolls tend to be higher than they really are for national elections. So, what would happen if NC were suddenly flipped to Trump? Well, Silver's projections would adjust accordingly. That's the nature of poll based models. However, if you use Norpoth's model, NC will easily go to Trump‚Ä¶ Given the lower turnout amount traditional DEM demographics, it's unlikely that they will meet or exceed the GOTV numbers from where they were in 2012. Still have a few days to see though. Next week, we'll know for sure who was right and who was wrong. In the end, these are all just poll or indicator based models and are subject to fail, at some point. We observed this in 2008 when Obama won yet there were indicators he wouldn't (high unemployment, low favorability, etc.). Yet Obama still won. So, indicator based predictions can fail as do poll based predictions. For those with a dog in the fight, in a week we can all meet back here and play Monday morning quarterback and either celebrate or lick our wounds‚Ä¶.",https://www.quora.com/How-statistically-sound-is-Helmut-Norpoths-primary-model-for-predicting-presidential-election-results,"If you read Helmut‚Äôs explanation ( 2020 ‚Äî The Primary Model ) he states this about how he incorporates primaries: For elections prior to 1952 all primaries were included. Beginning in 1952, only the New Hampshire Primary has been used, as a rule. South Carolina has been added for elections since 2008. I find this methodology strange and somewhat arbitrary. The fact that Helmut went from using all primaries, to just New Hampshire, to now New Hampshire and South Carolina since 2008 should set off alarm bells for anyone who understands statistical modeling. It would be one thing if he could give a reasonable explanation as to why he used this approach (i.e., modern polls are more accurate, the state of the electorate in the chosen states accurately reflects the national electorate, etc.) but no explanation is given. So I am inclined to say he has discovered a spurious correlation and people are eager to buy it because they don't understand statistics and think the polls were wrong in 2016 so we need to find some other way to predict who will win an election. So no, I do not think Helmut‚Äôs approach is statistically sound. It seems to me like he tweaked when the primary vote snapshot is taken to deliberately inflate the importance of this variable.","A well thought out and considered answer. You put much effort into your response and now, with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight, we can see that you were accurate and unbiased in your analysis I, for one, appreciate that! Kudos!","Great analysis and excellent writing explaining every aspect and detail of the polls and the prediction models, and how polls fall short in considering the voter enthusiasm that can be a game changer. However, is it possible that something may happen between the primaries and the last day of election that could personally or indirectly affect the voter and change/sway the voter enthusiasm/perception? Decided voters may likely remain intact but the undecided ones and secret admirers who often mislead the polls may have second thoughts? It may never have happened in the past, a trend that has put Norpoth‚Äôs method ahead of all others, but have the recent times been crazy enough to speculate?",I just can't buy with a straight face the fact that he gave Trump a 91% chance (near certainty) of winning in 2020. Most incumbent Presidents win and most dominate the primaries (he uses performance in primaries as his central or only determinant) But it isn't hard to pick a majority of Presidential elections. I imagine most pollsters have done as or nearly as well. Let's see how he does this time.,
Presidential Election,Will the GOP implode after the 2016 presidential election?,"I would say that the GOP can't really be hurt too badly as long as the Democrat party still exists. The reverse is also true of course.  There are lots of votes cast out of fear of what the other side will do. Examples: ""If you don't want a racist, fascist, misogynistic, spoiled rich kid,  war monger for president, then you better vote for the Democrat!"" ""If you don't want a godless, socialist, baby murdering, gun grabbing, communist-wannabe who will raise your taxes to buy votes from illegal immigrants through welfare programs, then you better vote Republican! "" See? The parties have positioned themselves so that they are completely abhorrent to the opposition. If your party ""imploded"" would you suddenly start liking the other party? Of course not.  The Republican party could, possibly, go away in name, but roughly half the country would still be just as disgusted by and terrified of another Democrat regime as they are now. A new, possibly re-branded Republican party would immediately form to take the money and votes from that half of the population. Oh, and it would need experienced people who know how to actually run a party. How convenient that all the people who used to run the Republican party are now out of work. . .  No, it would take something utterly catastrophic to kill both parties simultaneously to get us out from under this duopoly. At this point, the partisan Ds and Rs are probably so deeply entrenched that we can't kill the parasites without killing the host in the process.",https://www.quora.com/Will-the-GOP-implode-after-the-2016-presidential-election,,,,,

Presidential Election,The Republicans haven't won a Presidential election since 1988. Will they ever win one at any point in the future?,"Whoever gets the presidency wins the election. The closest we've come to civil unrest with this policy was in 1876, where Tilden won the popular vote and Hayes, through possibly corrupt means, won the electoral college. There was subsequently an assassination attempt upon Hayes, leading to the compromise of 1877 where Tilden did indeed confirm that Hayes had won the presidency. Just as in 2000, Gore conceded to Bush. Just as in 2004, when Kerry conceded to Bush. Disenfranchisement is a curious thing. From the Compromise of 1877 until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, disenfranchisement of African-Americans in the South was rampant, with laws restricting suffrage mostly aimed at African-Americans on the books in all former Confederate states. Even prior to this, African-Americans were routinely terrorized in former Confederate states no longer occupied by the Federal government. On an extra-legal basis, the second Ku Klux Klan operated from 1915-1944, making even attempts at ending this injustice fraught with peril. We know that, until FDR and the New Deal, African-Americans tended to vote strongly Republican - does this mean that the elections of Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were illegitimate by your standards? For that matter, I really have to wonder why you're not getting into an uproar about how we consider John Quincy Adams, Rutherford Hayes and Benjamin Harrison presidents even though none of them won the popular vote. I mean, yes, it would be the position of an absolute and obvious crank, but at least it would be consistent. But moving aside from this, from 1860 to 1932, the Democrats won the presidency four times. That's sixteen out of seventy-two years of US history. Not a great win percentage. During that time, nobody considered the Democrats a nonentity. And even after 72 years, they actually found themselves quite capable of reinventing themselves - the New Deal was largely an outgrowth of Progressivism, which was a Republican movement from thirty years earlier. Point being, the Republicans are still a force to be reckoned with, even if a popular portrayal of them is that they are out of touch - and dismissing them as being irrelevant is about the dumbest mistake the Democrats could make at this point.",https://www.quora.com/The-Republicans-havent-won-a-Presidential-election-since-1988-Will-they-ever-win-one-at-any-point-in-the-future,,,,,

My most expensive acoustic guitar is a custom shop Rozawood RJ-77 Jumbo. It was built in the Czech Republic and sounds beautiful. It is built from alpine spruce and jacaranda which is almost exactly like Brazilian rosewood. A good, basic working guitar is a Martin D-28. They‚Äôll set you back around $3,000 U.S. Takamine has some great guitars that you can get for less than a Martin D-28. For years, I used my 2004 Limited Edition Takamine to gig with. The pre-amp is acting up right now. I need to pull the strings off to see if something is unplugged inside the guitar. Taylor‚Äôs guitars sound great and aren‚Äôt overly expensive. Gibson makes some great guitars but their prices are very high. Four or five years ago a good friend of mine won an Earth Day songwriting competition. The grand prize was a Gibson acoustic guitar. I forget the model. My friend is left handed and they didn‚Äôt have a left hand model so Gibson MADE him one! The right hand model retails for well over $5,000 U.S.! I like to go Guitar Center and play their guitars. I‚Äôm amazed that they will let people do that. They will even let you play expensive guitars. So will Gruhns Guitars in Nashville. I picked up a used Olson acoustic guitar at Ghruns while they were still on Broadway in Nashville. The guitar was listed for $10,000 and there I was, pulling it off the wall and playing it! You will find that just because a guitar is expensive, it won‚Äôt necessarily sound better than an inexpensive guitar. Epiphone started out as its own guitar company but somewhere along the way, Gibson took them over and they make the less expensive models of the same Gibson guitars. I had never been a big fan of Epiphone guitars until I played an Epiphone Master Built series guitar at Guitar Center about three years ago. The guitar was listed for a little over $500 and it was one of the sweetest sounding guitars I‚Äôve ever played! Martin has some less expensive models now with the Martin name on them but back in the 1980‚Äôs they sold their less expensive models of acoustic guitars under the name, ‚ÄúSigma.‚Äù They look exactly like a Martin and the Sigma sticker on the headstock is in the exact same font as a Martin. Back in 1986 ot 1987, I bought a Sigma 12 string guitar. It seems like I paid around $260. Sigmas aren‚Äôt made any longer but recently I have seen some of the 12 strings going for close to $1,000 U.S.! Mine has a spruce top and a mahogany back. When I‚Äôm playing with other people, I have to be careful not to overpower everyone in the room because the guitar is so loud. There are other guitars that are less expensive than the ones listed below. Takamine has high and low end guitars and they are all good. I sold a concert size Takamine a couple of years ago but it was a good guitar. Taylor has less expensive models and I don‚Äôt think you can go wrong with any of those. The thing you really want to look for is the kind of wood an acoustic guitar is made from. Look for solid woods, not fancy named plywoods. For guitar tops, spruce is the usual choice. Other woods used for guitar tops are cedar and mahogany. For the body of the guitar Brazilian rosewood is probably the best and has some beautiful grain. The problem is, Brazilian rosewood is a protected species of wood and is highly expensive. Other rosewoods work great for guitar bodies. Indian rosewood is popular and sounds great. Jacaranda is almost exactly the same thing as Brazilian rosewood but much less expensive. Jacaranda trees grow in Western Florida. Other good brands are Dean guitars. They aren‚Äôt too expensive and a lot of their guitars are made of some exotic woods with beautiful inlay that normally doesn‚Äôt come on that price guitar. Ibanez makes decent acoustic and electric guitars. Ask around and if you are anywhere near a Guitar Center, go in and play lots of different guitars and then you tell me what you think the best brand of guitar is!",https://www.quora.com/Musicians-What-is-the-best-guitar,"‚ÄúAlpine spruce‚Äù? I know of many spruces used for soundboards, none of them are known (at least by the other luthiers I know) as ‚ÄúAlpine"". Sitka invariably grows mostly in somewhat Alpine regions, as does Carpathian. I believe Englemann would also be considered as growing in an Alpine region.",,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What are the features or factors I should be looking into when buying an electric guitar, especially when it‚Äôs for learning/playing extreme metal?","AtoZ of Guitar buying: (a) Never buy Acoustic guitar online. Even branded acoustic can sound poor than cheap guitar. (b) If you are learning and don't know much. Always better to take assistance from someone who had played guitar for years. (c) Check fret wire, should be smooth and firmly fixed without defects on fret board(i.e. rough edges are not fine and hurt finger much during playing) (d) Check Guitar Neck should be firm scaled with fret wire distances and strings should be just 1mm or 2mm above the fret wires. (i.e. neither too close nor too distanced from fret board) (e) Check wood box, it should be uniform and without any breakage at wood joints in edges. Check with torch inside the wood box too. There will be weird reaction by shop owner but don't bother. (f) Knock the wood box (sound box) with your fist or lower flesh part of thumb base. The sound should be close to base kick. Slap the curve part of wood box and sound should be like flat tomb hit. (g) Check Guitar Bridge (i.e. the string hook part on wood box) It should be fix strongly without any gap between wood box and bridge wood. Use any visit card to check gaps in it. (h) Check Guitar keys, it should be high quality without any defects. (i.e. Keys should be good quality, free from friction grip due to rust on screw junctions, strong enough to hold strings tension and smooth enough for player to tune guitar without any problem. Check quality while tuning guitar. (i) Play G major, A minor , D major cords and E minor chord with each string sound clearly. The sound should be clear and warm. (j) Rub your finger and thumb on guitar neck to confirm smoothness alone the guitar neck length. (k) Make sure guitar belt hook are not bolted near to guitar keys on neck. It must on base body and neck and wood box junction of guitar. (l) Brands for Acoustic guitar 1) Under Rs 3000 to 5000 : Pluto, Polo, Givson, Aria, Hobner etc (i.e. take someone assistance who had played guitar for years to select good sounding guitar in this budget. Guitar will start sounding creepy after 6 to 8 months) 2) Under Rs5000 to 8000 : G&B, Pluto, Aria, Yamaha classic C30 and C70 (best for serious beginner with interest in western classic) this range is good investment (four to five years) for serious guitar player. 3) Under Rs8000 to Rs 15000 : G&B studio version, Yamaha, Pluto, Epiphone, Fender (Good investment for Home recording and Artist in budget) 4) Above Rs15000 (Studio recording) : Takamine G series, Yamaha Pro series, Taylor, Martin, Seville 5) Blueberry Guitars : Perfect craft of wood, art and guitar sound. (i.e., for Guitarligious soles, Guitar worshipers, and Art collectors) 6) Guitar by Luthiers : These are Hand made guitar and Every Luthier has his/her USP. 7) Electric guitar Rs 15000 to Rs 35000 : Yamaha, Ibanez, Kort, BC Rich, Gibson. (j) Wood quality affects tone and durability of guitar. Expensive guitar don't necessary sound good. Most of Pro-guitarist select guitar on the basis of quality not brand name. (k) For small finger and left hand guitarist one should more careful and search more cause suitable guitar not available every time. (l) For Small finger try Koren, Indonesian or Vietnamese guitar brands. (m) For Electric guitar, one can try branded Electric guitar online. However, it is better to do proper search before buying. (n) Most of rules will be same as Acoustic guitar. Like Fret, Neck Keys, Belt etc. (o) Select the Electric guitar as per your music and tone requirement. Electric Guitar are three types solid-body, semi-hollow, and hollow-body. (p) Solid body guitar are good choice for Loud amplification and synthesized effects. (Popular choice are Ibanez, Kort, Yamaha, Jackson, BC Rich, Gibson, Les Paul) (q) Semi-hollow body electric guitars are good choice for Acoustic sound with high amplification. (r) Hollow-body (also knows as jazz guitar), give good acoustic sound with mild amplification but as high amplification give mad horse sound. (s) Select guitar modal as per required Scale Length, Intonation and number of frets. These things are very important for artist working on professional level. It effect the tone quality and range during recording. (u) Make sure which bridge one want to use during guitar playing tremolo bridge or stop-tail bridge has his own advantages and disadvantages. It is purely individual choices. (v) Guitar Picks ups are the most crucial part of electric guitar. Single coil (most common), Humbucker Pickups (humming sound good for rock and metal) and Piezo pickups (synthesizer effect) (w) Don't buy combo pack for electric guitar. Value pack are actually fooling packs. (x) Buy Electric guitar and amplifier separately. If you are playing and practice alone at home better to plug electric guitar in laptop or PC through, midi or audio cable available at affordable price. (y) Amp and guitar effect are not must buy at initial for electric guitar. One can enjoy guitar playing with dedicated GNU/Linux operating systems like Ubuntu studio, 64 studio, K studio, Artix, Musix etc. (z) Don't be fool in better guitar = better player. Practice! Practice! Practice! It makes perfect.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-features-or-factors-I-should-be-looking-into-when-buying-an-electric-guitar-especially-when-it-s-for-learning-playing-extreme-metal,"Wow, that's plenty info, thank you for the info. My budget is 15k and looks like Cort guitars are the only good quality guitars under that price, Ibanez, Fender and Gibson are all over 15k. Whats is your opnion about kort guitars?",,,,
Ibanez Series S,Will Nutube guitar amplifiers be revolutionary? Or is it just a fad?,"Revolutionary? Maybe. Fad? Most likely not. That‚Äôs the best that I can do without a crystal ball. So, the way I came up with this answer is that I‚Äôve had a Vox MV50 for some time now, the Boutique model. You can check it out at  Vox‚Äôs product page . In short, it‚Äôs a 50 Watt head and weights just over a pound. Most importantly for this answer, it uses the Nutube technology. For more details on that, check out  Korg‚Äôs product page . Coincidentally,  Vox is owned by Korg , to what level of controlling interest, I don‚Äôt know. All I know is that the Nutube isn‚Äôt a traditional tube design. It uses ‚Äúanode grid filament structure‚Äù per the product page. With that, you can get a tube sound. However, this technology allows amp heads to get that 50 Watt performance in just a pound or so. This is just my understanding, I‚Äôm open to corrections. Before I go on, I don‚Äôt want to make this answer to be a product review. It‚Äôs to answer whether or not this Nutube will be revolutionary or just a fad. There are plenty of reviews from the major corners of the internet that go into the features in better detail than I do. I‚Äôll provide some context. My not so scientific methodology First things first, I have limited funds and therefore limited gear. I played this head over two cabs. First, I use a  Hotone 10‚Äì15 Watt mini cabinet , which is perfect for me because it‚Äôs perfect for my neighbors in my condo. What they can‚Äôt hear, they won‚Äôt be able to complain about. The second cabinet is my  Vox BC112 , which is an 8 Ohm 70 Watt cab with 1 x 12"" Celestion V-type speakers. The 8 Ohm part is useful because the BC112 is also at 8 Ohms and the head is adjustable to 4, 8 and 16 Ohms. The Hotone, I just set to 16 Ohms for a much lower Wattage, and thus, much lower volumes. For the guitar in this test, I use my Ibanez S series that‚Äôs configured with dual humbuckers, as I really don‚Äôt play much single coil. I keep things simple, messing around with the gain, tone and volume controls until I get the settings that I like. That‚Äôs pretty much at gain level where it just starts to break up and 12 o‚Äôclock on the tone. I‚Äôve strummed a bunch of chords and noodled a few licks for months. Again, simple and not scientific. My own conclusion Overall, I like this setup. I‚Äôve had a bunch of amps over the years and this is my favorite setup so far. I understand that everyone‚Äôs taste is different, but here are some of my observations. First, the tone is really good for my liking. The gain gets the overall sound to what I like with a nice warm effect. Clean tone sounds great. Second, neck pickup sounds great for what I need. Bridge is a bit bright, but that‚Äôs OK because I can control the tone with the tone knob on my guitar and on the head. My own opinion on fad vs. revolutionary I‚Äôm just an average guy playing average stuff on non-pro gear. I bought this based on YouTube videos that I‚Äôve watched as well as product reviews that I‚Äôve read. Apparently, I‚Äôd say that I‚Äôm an ideal target for the product at this price point at a street price of $220 or so. I figure that if someone like me bought it and likes it, there‚Äôs a good chance others will too. A fad is something that I think is trendy at the moment and will be forgotten shortly thereafter. I don‚Äôt think that the MV50 is such a product. Likewise, a revolutionary product is something that I think of as a complete game changer, and I‚Äôm not sure the MV50 falls in that camp as well, but it could! Why won‚Äôt it be revolutionary? Well, my guess is that the pure solid state guys may not gravitate towards it and the pure tube folks won‚Äôt either. At least not initially. It might take a few Vox advertising dollars at first. Sure, some might have a few dollars to spend to satisfy their curiosity. However, younger buyers may be interested in getting a tube sound, or something really close. They may not care that they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúpure‚Äù tube sound. They may not be able to tell the difference. They might also not have established any brand loyalties yet. At this price point and the weight being so small, it might be attractive to that kind of buyer. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fad because this head really packs value. It‚Äôs easy to setup and easy to use. It sounds good, or maybe good enough for some. You don‚Äôt have to wait to warm up the tubes, at least I don‚Äôt for better or for worse. Plus some manufacturers are making amp heads smaller now like Orange‚Äôs Tiny Terror. There‚Äôs some lesser brands getting into that market as well. That said, starter packs or small combos will probably be the choice of beginners. That‚Äôs not to say that a Nutube combo can‚Äôt penetrate that market down the road. So it‚Äôs probably more like a trend than anything else. There‚Äôs a lot of information on this Nutube, so it‚Äôs worth checking out.",https://www.quora.com/Will-Nutube-guitar-amplifiers-be-revolutionary-Or-is-it-just-a-fad,It‚Äôs worth noting that the NuTube is a preamp tube rather than a power tube. The VOX MV50 series uses a solid state (I‚Äôm guessing FET) power amp section. NuTube technology hasn‚Äôt yet given us the power tube distortion that many guitarists crave. I‚Äôm sure Korg and Noritaki are working on it.,,,,
Presidential Election,What does Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election mean to you personally?,"""It was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness... season of Light, ...season of Darkness, ....spring of hope, ....winter of despair""  A tale of two cities, Charles Dickens Depending on what color you wear on your sleeve, your mileage (and faith in the democratic process) may vary today. Welcome to the tale of the two cities.  As the UK woke up to a rainy cold gloomy morning made somber by events across the pond, it was a time for reflection for many of us. Things that some of us had predicted to #NeverTrump happen, happened. While still digesting the news, I could not help but marvel at how  prone to confirmation bias we are, as individuals . It is still too early to come out with a definitive analysis of how the tide turned the way it did. Also, this post is not about labeling voters a certain way or being in denial ‚Äì we have enough time to see the 5 stages of grief unfold from all quarters of the democratic establishment. That‚Äôs for the latter part of this week. It is instead about realizing the  fallacy of human intuition and the introduction of bias in statistical methods , especially when applied to situations where the human modeler is  emotionally invested  in the outcome ‚Äì Trump over Hillary, iOS over Android, et al. For kicks, try having a conversation with Apple fan-persons (even while trash talking, be PC) and ask them why a Mac is better than a windows machine when most things are done over a browser now anyways ‚Äì and see them justify their qualitative preferences for design with unreliable data or fuming at the mouth. In data, we believe(d) As a career analyst and a strong believer in signals generated by data, I have always valued statistical/machine learning methods over gut-feel. I have advocated (and continue to advocate) the dire need for organizations to be more data-driven and add rigor to decision making processes. As is customary, I had consumed an overdose of election numbers and predictions prior to the event. One of the prominent ones was Nate Silver, (self?) promoted pollster of the day, who advertises his website five-thirty-eight thus: FiveThirtyEight | Nate Silver‚Äôs FiveThirtyEight uses statistical analysis ‚Äî hard numbers ‚Äî to tell compelling stories about politics, sports, science, economics and culture. This is what he predicted.  Source:  2016 Election Forecast | FiveThirtyEight A seminal author in the mathematics of probabilities and the author of  ‚ÄúThe Black Swan: Impact of the Highly Improbable‚Äù , Nassem Nicholas Taleb (NNT), called out the problems with Nate‚Äôs analysis back in August.  NNT, however, did not hazard a contrarian guess or solidify his position, instead going on record to say that a Trump win is 'also' likely. There have also been recent articles from statistics professors on why Nate Silver‚Äôs method is faulty, although with the benefit of hindsight many things appear clearer. For me, today‚Äôs decision was a sober reminder the even the best of analytical techniques, statistics, data mining, machine learning, or big data analytics do not guarantee a thorough understanding of voter/customer sentiments and resulting action. To expect that all real-world events neatly conform to a predictable pattern is in itself a fallacy. Today‚Äôs revelation is also a sharp reminder to me, and possibly many of you, to revise some assumptions that underlie most data-driven approaches to decision-making, whether it be in business or in poll calling. Namely: The past may not always be a predictor of the future ‚Äì Nate Silver was right up to the point he wasn‚Äôt.  Source:  Electoral Precedent Also, There is never enough/all of the data to complete a picture, which is why statistical/machine learning methods are used. Also, conclusions are rarely derived using all the data but a representative sample is used Correlation does not imply causation The data is otherwise clean, and reliable, and captures true intent ‚Äì with Trump supporters, there was a strong disincentive to openly admit their position. Also, most data didn't capture tacit knowledge/intent. There has been a factoring for context ‚Äì people who built the model understand the industry/consumer/voter in-depth There is a method to the madness ‚Äì some processes, such as ones based on theoretical calculations, just cannot be put into a neat little pattern My point here is that right up to the event, statisticians, market watchers, as well as international stock markets and communities reinforced the belief that there was a clear mandate and they knew what it was. More data was found and massaged to reinforce their hypothesis and naysayers were quickly shot down (Notably, Scott Adams and Michael Moore). Within my own echo chamber, amplified by a very left-leaning community on Quora, I was confident that I had called the election right. A lot of us forgot that we have been similarly wrong about Brexit. Does that mean we should do away with the analytical method once and for all?If we can‚Äôt trust data/analytics, why invest in it at all? Not at all. Instead, use AI/machine learning to recognize inherent and cognitive biases in analysis and how  we make decisions. In fact, today may be the best day to ponder about the  applicability of AI to real-world problems  and whether it can  help us be cognizant of and guard against our cognitive biases . Trained over time, powered by near-unlimited IT infrastructure on the cloud, and given access to ‚Äòall‚Äô the data and not a sample, machine learning and artificial intelligence can likely recognize cognitive biases in models (and individuals) and show us a range scenarios instead of one clear result. It doesn‚Äôt just stop at identifying cognitive bias though. There are several other biases  Bias (statistics) - Wikipedia  that all of us carry. Bias-aware/free AI offerings Developing a bias detector is not a new idea. IBM has been promoting ‚Äòunbiased‚Äô or  ‚Äòbias-aware‚Äô as a virtue of its IBM Watson platform  for quite a while. They are not alone. Mega-vendors are launching machine learning and ‚Äúintelligent applications‚Äù initiatives by the dozen this year, with recent ones including Oracle ( September 2016 at OpenWorld ) , SAP ( November 2016 TechEd Barcelona ),  Salesforce Einstein  (timed to release before OOW16). Services providers such as  Accenture  and Wipro HOLMES (rather cheeky!) are also at the forefront of this movement, combining cognitive computing and deep industry expertise and applying it to a business pain-point, with the potential to unlock significant business value. Today‚Äôs announcement reinforces my belief that I could have a more productive discussion with AI enthusiasts and evangelists if I was to think about AI this way: ‚ÄúThis machine can tell me  how  I think‚Äù instead of ‚ÄòIt will be a hot day in hell before I let a machine tell me  what  to think‚Äô. What happens now? The political theatrics will dampen, for the time being and markets will gradually stabilize After the initial stages of grief have passed, the democratic machinery will likely pick itself up and start to regroup. The fact that the Senate, House, and the Supreme Court are all red or will be in the future actually gives the Republicans a greater chance at bringing about sweeping policy changes than the previous administration, if they so wish. There will a large number of focused issues that will be contested by democrats now more than ever, such as immigration reform and women‚Äôs health. On the financial markets front, the shock dip of currencies and markets is likely temporary; based on fundamentals the US economy and consumer confidence are the largest factors for investment, and while the US President is an extremely influential person he/she does not directly control these things. The international community will be watchful and evaluate decisions on a case by case basis for the next few weeks/months. On the business front, it will be business as usual. Some sales cycles may lengthen, and if you are working with the government there might be some teething issues. Obamacare will likely be repealed. My one big prediction though is that  an AI/ML driven system will replace Nate Silver soon . When that company/product materializes, I will either be its CEO, or suing its CEO for stealing my idea.

Presidential Election,Why is China silent about the US presidential election?,"Well, actually, China is not ‚Äúsilent‚Äù on the US presidential election, but it indeed does not take sides as to who will be the next president.

And as for the media coverage, though the US election is not on the headlines on a daily base, as there are many other top stories, such as  5th plenary session of 19th CPC Central Committee , which will define China‚Äôs development road of the next five years and even into 2035, and also the ongoing  China International Import Expo 2020 , a rare event for the year 2020, as most other nations are still trapped in the COVID-19 pandemic, there are lots of coverage on the 2020 US election. But of course, it‚Äôs not Chinese media outlets‚Äô position to express their pro or against either one of the candidates, since it is indeed the US internal business and it‚Äôs the American‚Äôs right to decide. I will just list some of the reports by Chinese media outlets in English: By CGTN: U.S. Election 2020 Biden makes victory speech, Trump refuses to concede defeat Biden pledges to be a unifying president U.S. Election 2020: A look at Joe Biden's life in Wilmington, Delaware Congratulations flood in for Biden's 'historic' win What if Trump refuses to leave office?

These are just my random picks of some of the reports or analyses, there have been many more in recent months, especially in the past several days. From the above examples, it‚Äôs not difficult to see that Chinese media outlets are also following the 2020 US presidential election very closely. Anyway, it‚Äôs actually not only a US event, but it‚Äôs also so important to the Sino-US future relations, and also important for the whole world as well. ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Then, how about the general public here in China? Are Chinese people silent? No, of course not. On the contrary, we are enjoying the ‚Äúreality show‚Äù version of House of Cards very much, same as most of the people from other countries across the world. So, following the world‚Äôs ‚Äútrend,‚Äù there are also many witty talks, funny pictures, meme photos in Chinese, either original Chinese ones, or revised ones from English netizens, like these:  (A lonely Trump with an ancient poem by Lu You, one of the most greatest poets in ancient China, to express though in a hard situation, Trump is still vying to dedicate his efforts to ‚Äúdevote‚Äù to the US.)    [In China‚Äôs Shandong Province, there are two cities, Dezhou and Binzhou, which coincidentally are exactly the same characters of the shortened names for the Chinese translation of ‚ÄúState of Texas (Dezhou, in short version Chinese)‚Äù and ‚ÄúState of Pennsylvania (Binzhou, in short version Chinese)‚Äù. So, many people in the province are joking that their two cities are so important that they are ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù the final results of the 2020 US presidential election.]  (This is an imitation of a choice question in an examination.)  (The image of an famous Chinese actress, who usually portrays characters who are somehow silly or stupid, was used to express ‚ÄúCan an old lady like me enjoy the party with you guys?‚Äù) Also in the above mentioned Global Times piece on this,  Chinese people showing interest in US presidential election for laughs, comicalness , tells us how Chinese ordinary people are following the 2020 US presidential election. ‚ÄúTopics relating to the US election have been trending on China's most popular social media platform Sina Weibo for days, with ""#US Presidential election"" attracting around 6.77 billion reads. Its more recent developments, such as Donald Trump's reported plan to file lawsuits in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Georgia, have already garnered more than 100 million reads in one hour. The discussion about the election, however, might come as a surprise: It's mostly entertaining.

Tricking,What are some cool science tricks?,"I can make you disappear just by writing some words. Watch: Everyone knows that human bodies are composed of matter and are animated by energy. I‚Äôm a doctor, so I‚Äôve tried to look into that state of affairs a little. Now, matter can be made subject to experimentation. For example, when we take blood for analysis or measure electrical currents in tissues or absorption of radiation in diagnostic procedures the fact that the substances involved follow defined, predictable patterns in keeping with physics and it‚Äôs mathematical expression is what allows us to make inferences. The only way we can know anything about the human body at all is by reproducible observations. This much is obvious. So, because that experimentation is possible and has been done we have observed a great many things and recorded the relevant consequences. By no means do we know ‚Äòeverything‚Äô (that may not even be possible) but we know ‚Äòenough‚Äô in many ways. For example we can be quite confident that people are dead, given values for certain parameters. Therefore medical science has resulted in a number of discoveries, and perhaps the most interesting involve the operation of the central nervous system. For example, at this moment, photoreception in retinal layers is resulting in conformational changes in rhodopsin and sets of second messengers producing depolarisation of neuronal membranes. These local fluctuations in charge are propagated via axonal and synaptic transmission according to thermodynamic thresholds. This is why the human body must be maintained in a certain temperature range.  28 The Electric Signals Originating in the Eye Interneurons transfer such signals to populations of pyramidal cells and Purkinje cells (among many other types) that then deliver fractions of the incident energy of the aforementioned photon to tissues beyond the nervous system (for example, via neuromuscular junctions) and feed back on the circuit supplying them in a manner that induces adaptation of that anatomy over time.  Climbing Fiber Regulation of Spontaneous Purkinje Cell Activity and Cerebellum-Dependent Blink Responses These areas of activation then induce alterations of muscular proteins that finally expend some of the originally absorbed energy (together with that which is liberated by enzymatic action on ingested substances) in kinetic terms.  The Neuromuscular Junction: Aging at the Crossroad between Nerves and Muscle So, although highly complex we can see from the very fact these things  can   be   studied  that the entire exercise is explained by thermodynamic theory. Energies are transferred via pathetic of least resistance through interactions between ions, enzymes, carbohydrates and proteins to produce various performances that are necessarily predictable (again, otherwise observations would not be reproducible in perceptible patterns). Thus, what is clearly evident here is that nothing  other  than trivial physical interactions is required for the human body to behave as we observe. Therefore ‚Äòyou‚Äô - in any sense that can be isolated from such mundane mechanics - are not necessary and (in empirical terms - the only terms for which there is any evidence) do not exist. See? No you! Proven by  seeing  and gone in the wink of an eye - while you‚Äôre watching! Great trick, huh? ",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cool-science-tricks,‚ÄúTherefore ‚Äòyou‚Äô - in any sense that can be isolated from such mundane mechanics - are not necessary and (in empirical terms - the only terms for which there is any evidence) do not exist‚Äù was alone worth the read! I‚Äôm somewhat puzzled as to how over 200 people have read this and there‚Äôs only 2 Upvotes. I‚Äôm compelled to conclude: ,"Really nice!

""Therefore ‚Äòyou‚Äô - in any sense that can be isolated from such mundane mechanics - are not necessary and (in empirical terms - the only terms for which there is any evidence) do not exist."" Yes, but... the thermodynamic theory is nothing else then a logical structure constructed in the brain. There is no such thing as thermodynamic theory out there, in the physical world. In fact the only reality we are aware of is a logical structure in the brain build based on the data received from our sense organs. Data that is both incomplete and not 100% reliable. That's why science is neither complete nor it creates an 100% correct model (or explanation) of the reality. Therefore the opposite can be said as well : the only existence we can be absolutely sure of is the existence of ourselves.",,,
Tricking,What are some of the best command prompt or terminal tricks?,"A couple useful ones I use a lot: These are all equivalent:
$ cd                               # no arguments
$ cd ~                            # ~ equates to home
$ cd /home/`whoami`   # assuming a normal home structure Searching for a particular filename:
$ find . -name filena*    # finds all files beginning with ""filena"" Tab completion
Pressing the tab key mid-command will complete the rest of the filename or command, if known. This is a very flexible thing and can often be used even for arguments, sometimes. Searching Command History
Pressing ""Ctrl+R"" will search through your command history -- type the beginning of a command you've previously typed and it will help you locate it. Piping Through Grep
When you have a big output, pipe it through grep with a filter so you can just isolate the lines you want.
$ ps ax | grep smbd   # Find all processes that look like ""smbd""
$ cat somefile.txt | grep TODO  # finds all lines in somefile.txt with the word ""TODO""
$ tailf /var/log/some.log | grep GET # does an active tail on some.log, displaying every time a line with ""GET"" comes through. (May be OS dependent) Switching to TTY
Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Fn  where n = 1..6 will switch you to a different terminal session F7 is often reserved for your GUI session. Using backticks
You can wrap backticks ( ` ) around a string and it will run that as a command, as part of another command, interpolated: $ ls /home/`whoami`",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-best-command-prompt-or-terminal-tricks,"Note: find . -name filena* should be find . -name ""filena*"" with quotes around filena* otherwise the shell expands it immediately and find fails (end even if it did not fail, you would not find any files in subfolders).

' ' ` ` "" "" These characters look similar and all have distinctly different results: echo '$HOME'
echo ""$HOME""

echo `$HOME`
echo $HOME It is also possible to use braces to allow variable or parameter expansion. Such as this:
echo ${HOME}
Braces allow for fun tricks like this, which capitalizes all output:
echo ${HOME^^}
This is one example of bash string manipulation.  The use may not be clear at first, but knowing that it is possible comes in handy. One of my favorites is this:
mkdir -p /some/deep/path && cd $_
This creates any directories in that path that do not exist and then changes in to the last directory. Also it is a good practice to test things before using them: [[ -d /foo/bar && -w /foo/bar ]] && touch /foo/bar/baz || echo 'got a problem here'",,,
Tricking,What are some secret tricks you should know about Android?,"Here are some very good but least known android tricks: 1) Enable Developer Mode Navigate to  Settings > About  phone and tap on your phone‚Äôs build number seven times. You‚Äôll get an onscreen countdown, eventually followed by a message saying ‚ÄúCongratulations, you are now a developer‚Äù. 2) Change the Animation Scales For the most part, the latest Android phones already feel very snappy. However, after the latest Nexus 5X only shipped with 2GB of RAM, some users were left feeling a bit underwhelmed by Google‚Äôs hugely popular product line. One solution is to change your phone‚Äôs ‚ÄúWindow animation scale‚Äù, ‚ÄúTransition animation scale‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnimator duration scale‚Äù from 1x to 0.5x. Granted, it won‚Äôt actually make your phone faster, but it will make it  feel  faster. Go to  Settings > Developer options  and scroll about two thirds of the way down the list to find the necessary options (you‚Äôll need to have first enabled Developer Mode). 3) Clear App Defaults It‚Äôs annoying when a link opens in a certain app rather than in the browser. It could be a YouTube link, a tweet, or a Facebook page ‚Äî you‚Äôll end up waiting around while your phone shuts down Chrome (or your browser of choice) and fires up something else. It‚Äôs easily fixed. Go to  Settings > Apps  and find the app that keeps opening. Once there, scroll down to  Open by default , press it, and then select  Clear Defaults . If that doesn‚Äôt work, try doing the same with your browser app as well. 4) Quickly Change Your WiFi Network Oddly, how to quickly switch between WiFi networks is not very obvious. Sure, you can go to  Settings > Wi-Fi  and change it there, but there has to be a faster way, right? Swipe down twice from the top of your screen to open the  Quick Settings  menu, and instead of pressing on the WiFi icon (which disables it), instead press on the network‚Äôs name. You‚Äôll immediately be given a list of all the networks in your vicinity. 5) Quickly Access the Quick Settings Menu Speaking of the Quick Settings menu, did you know you don‚Äôt actually need to double swipe in order to access it? Instead, a simultaneous two-finger swipe will have the same effect. 6) Cast Your Screen If so, you can easily mirror your Android‚Äôs screen (and individual apps) by using the cast function. Just open the  Quick Settings  menu and hit  Cast . Your device will find your Chromecast (assuming it‚Äôs on the same local network), and you‚Äôre good to go. 7) Locate Annoying Notifications Do you keep getting an annoying app notification, but you‚Äôre not sure which app is causing it? There is an easy solution ‚Äî just long-press on the notification in question, and your device will tell you. 8) Manage App Notifications Moving on one step further from the previous tip, after you‚Äôve long-pressed the app you‚Äôll see an information icon. Press it, and you‚Äôll be presented with the notification settings for the app in question. You can do things like block all its notifications, allow it to override priority mode, and make it hide private information. 9) Map Zoom Ever need to use Google Maps one-handed? (No, not while you‚Äôre driving!) Just double tap the screen and swipe up and down to zoom in and out ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lot less fiddly than trying to pinch your fingers and hold your phone at the same time! 10) Screen Pinning If you have kids using your phone regularly, this is a great way to make sure they don‚Äôt accident run up huge bills or set their eyes on content that is age-inappropriate. Firstly, you‚Äôll need to enable the feature (oddly, it is turned off by default). Do that by going to  Settings > Security  and scrolling down to  Screen pinning .

Tricking,What is the cruelest trick of the mind?,"The cruelest trick of the mind is how our brains convince us we are madly in love with someone that could be totally wrong for us. I have heard it said ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt control who you love.‚Äù That statement is actually false, you can control it and you should. But that takes a high level of awareness and understanding of what is happening, otherwise you can get swept up in a future disaster. Millions of bad love choices are made every day, most of them will fail miserably. After what seems to be something perfect burns off the chemicals, i.e. adrenaline, dopamine and serotonin, then you look at the person and say ..um, no. And what usually happens is you try to make it work and it just doesn't, because it was a terrible choice to begin with. Dr Donatella Marazziti, a psychiatrist at the University of Pisa advertised for twenty couples who'd been madly in love for less than six months. She wanted to see if the brain mechanisms that cause you to constantly think about your lover, were related to the brain mechanisms of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. By analysing blood samples from the lovers, Dr Marazitti discovered that serotonin levels of new lovers were equivalent to the low serotonin levels of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder patients. Love needs to be blind Newly smitten lovers often idealise their partner, magnifying their virtues and explaining away their flaws says Ellen Berscheid, a leading researcher on the psychology of love. New couples also exalt the relationship itself. ‚ÄúIt's very common to think they have a relationship that's closer and more special than anyone else's‚Äù. Psychologists think we need this rose-tinted view. It makes us want to stay together to enter the next stage of love ‚Äì attachment.

Tricking,Are there any military tricks that would be useful for ordinary people to know?,"Edit: Thank you all for reading, commenting and voting. I am very happy to be able to help someone else. So there, I've added a few other tricks at the end. If you like it I will add some others and my own homemade videos. Here are my preferred military tricks for civilian security and confort: Put sugar on your wounds. It is a natural antibacterial. In a public shower, pee before using it. Urine will kill fungus. Take your shower before going to bed because it was during the day that you worked, sweated. In the morning, just jump in the shower for only three minutes just to wake up. Iron your clothes and shine your shoes. Be proud. Stand in an upright posture. Always carry a legal small foldable knife with you. It's a useful tool. If you're hiking put in a little bit of sugar, salt, and lemon juice in your water to avoid dehydration. When traveling roll your clothes individually in a plastic bag instead of folding them. They will stay dry and will not wrinkle. Always carry earplugs, they'll help you to sleep anywhere. Carry a needle, white and black thread (green for soldiers) in your wallet. You never know. If you're lost in the wild prepare a fire during the night and add green leaves during the day to make smoke. It will help rescuers to find your position at anytime. Before leaving, prepare an itinerary and give it to a relative or a good friend. Never go off your route. If you cannot return home for any reason, rescuers will know your way in advance. Avoid fights as much as possible. It is not worth it. I hope these tricks will be useful for all of you if you ever need them. Part 2 June 24, 2020: Stay fit and healthy, exercise continuously. Run at least a kilometer three times a week. Put some Vaseline in a cotton ball and use it to start a fire. In an emergency, you can use sanitary napkins for women, to prevent a person from bleeding. To prevent your boots from coming off, make a few knots along the laces. Avoid sweating when the temperature is too low. If you sweat you may experience hypothermia after working. Brush your teeth after each meal, you don't want to have a toothache, especially when you're away from civilization. In the wild save the water, brush your teeth using only one cup of water. Check the location of all doors and windows when you enter a new place. Remember that a weapon is always loaded, even if it is not assembled. Never overestimate your enemy. Never underestimate your enemy. If you're lost in the desert and only have a little water, drink it all. Some people have been found dead from dehydration alongside a good supply of water. Thank you for your upvoting. Part 3 July 2, 2020: Before going on an expedition, it is essential to do a RECCE or reconnaissance for civilians. A Field Operation Order is required for any expedition even if you're a civilian: Situation; Mission; Execution; Administration / Logistics; Command / Signal. When traveling, always carry water purification tablets. Each tablet treats to prevent diarrhea, giardia, e. Coli, faecal coliforms, cholera, Typhoid and other waterborne disease and illness. Never drink rainwater that falls from a tree as it may contain larvae and feces left by animals and birds. Carry a whistle, it could help you if you are lost or in distress. Remember the SOS Morse code 3 quick shots + 3 slow shots + three quick shots (If you are under threat from someone, you can do so by blinking): ... _ _ _ ... or bep bep bep beeeep beeeep beeeep bep bep bep. In the wild pee and poop always in the same place in a hole downstream from any water source. Store POL, petroleum, oils and lubricants in a location lower than your campsite. Petroleum gas will be less dangerous if there is a spill and gases will stay in the lowest place. If you need to protect yourself from a winter storm and don't have the required equipment, dig a hole as deep as possible in the snow, cover the bottom with coniferous branches (fir, spruce) and tightly cover the top with lots of coniferous branches. The temperature should remain at 2 ¬∞ C in your shelter even if the outside temperature is -40 ¬∞ C. If someone attacks you while holding you, tear off his nose or ear while biting with all your might then run away and shout very loudly asking for help.",https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-military-tricks-that-would-be-useful-for-ordinary-people-to-know,"In my auto I keep the following. A first aid kit, metal box, equipped to handle cuts, broken bones, severe bleeding Keep emergency blankets in glove box. A sweater/jacket Always have a shovel in trunk, canned fish and crackers, a few liters of water, matches, a striking plate and flint. Tow strap, snow chains, (also good for silt sand). two or more flash lights, red lens cover, whistle, blow 3 times, pause repeat in case of being lost.. Pistol, stored as per laws of state you are in.","‚ÄúIn a public shower, pee before using it. Urine will kill fungus.‚Äù That will make you really popular! Carrying a knife of a Leatherman tool?

However, it does not prevent dehydration, only water does that, but you need the salts that you sweat out. And I second  Colin Harasti . Pu things in the same place. I saw this recommended in a business magazine, and it is really helpful. I think this has been said, but when flying or in a hotel: note where the exits are!","I would add, from my experience: Put everything in the exact same place, every time. Same pocket, same shelf, same hook, same compartment- doesn't matter. Just make sure you are 100% consistent. It really helps when dressing or maneuvering in the dark, or working in cramped spaces or stressful environments.","If I had to add something, it would be Don't sit in a public place with your back exposed to people and always try to sit closest to an exit but farthest from an entrance so that you can see who enters the building, walks in the room/lobby, or wherever you are. Always try to have your back against a wall, pillar, tall partition, or some kind of obstruction that makes it difficult to get to/see you and preferably doesn't obstruct you from getting to the exit or your view of the flow of people into the building. Oh, one more thing, there's almost always an employee exit in the back room.",Couldn't agree more on the last point. Very important life lesson in general. Let idiots fight while you step back and enjoy the chaos that ensues.
Tricking,What are the tricks employed by casinos to attract and retain gamblers?,"Casinos are a maze, once you enter it‚Äôs confusing how to leave. The halls look like exits, but could loop you back into the casino table games. If you‚Äôve been to Wynn in Las Vegas or Macau, you‚Äôll know what I mean. The Wynn's layout makes it ridiculously hard know which exit to take. Multiple ATM machines clearly accessible inside casinos, welcoming your cash withdrawal. ATMs may be outside entrance if state/country law doesn‚Äôt allow inside ATMs. Games have low house edge, giving realistic chances to win your money back. 49% chance of winning, 51% chance of losing is enough odds for gamblers to continue playing once they‚Äôre losing.  Gamblers fallacy  makes them think if they‚Äôre losing, they‚Äôll be more likely to win on the near future rounds. Games are setup to make you feel more in control. Like Blackjack, you have an option to hit, stand, split, double. When players feel in control they‚Äôll continue playing the games. This is true for both short and long term gambling. Betting with chips, not real cash. Easy to forget you‚Äôre playing with real money. It‚Äôs such a easy gesture to drop 4 $25 chips into a box, and feels harmless. It can give an illusion of power, like you‚Äôre about to get your revenge on the casino just by moving plastic into box. Signing up for membership, casinos can track pretty much everything you do inside the casino from your membership card. Including: games you play, average bet, usual tables limits, duration of play, food purchased, your accommodation. They'll categories you as a certain type of member, tailoring their SMS and emails they send to you, giving you an incentive to return (usually through promotions). Regular promotions:

Example Promotion 1) Signup and get x2 $25 non-negotiable chips. These chips can be used for betting once only, then they‚Äôre taken. If you win from these non-negotiable bet you‚Äôll be paid out real chips. Non-negotiable chips need to be bet, they cannot be cashed straight away.

Example Promotion 2) Go in a draw to win a sports car. Enter the draw by playing any game in the casino on weekdays. One casino may give away a sports car every month for 4 months. Players get to know other players, dealers, and supervisors. Casinos can be very social places. Once there‚Äôs a regular social aspect with gambling, it reinforces the behaviour making it harder to discontinue. Especially true for  poker  players. Other forms of entertainment inside casinos.
- Huge TV screens showing all different sports, dancing performances, magic shows, and live bands.
- Night clubs, bars, restaurants, retails stores, conferences & events.
- Hotel guests have gyms, swimming pools, saunas, tanning rooms, and pretty much anything you can think of. Casinos give a tonne of hospitality, giving customers everything they need to stay entertained and fed. They cover most basic human desires effectively. Famous places like Las Vegas make ‚Äòcool' stories to tell friends. ‚ÄúWent to Vegas and won $1,000, lost it all back the same night, plus another $1,500.."" On low-limit tables, bets are very affordable (unless you‚Äôre in Macau). However, even though you might start with a $5 bet, emotions can take over and your bet slides up to $100+ (this happens more than people think).

Tricking,What are some cool tricks?,"Suppose you‚Äôre in an ATM and the thief tries to threaten you or rob you  Things you should know at that time Don‚Äôt think that by putting your ATM pin backwards is going to save you by alerting the nearby police.

Italian Restaurant,If you go to an Italian Restaurant would you expect the pasta to be made fresh or from a packet?,"There are two types of pasta. Fresh pasta and dried pasta. Fresh pasta  Fresh pasta is most commonly egg-based and made with regular wheat flour. As it‚Äôs laid in thin sheets, the number of shapes you can produce is limited. It‚Äôs also the kind of pasta used to make stuffed pasta as the above tortelli and ravioli.  Fresh durum wheat pasta is mad in some southern regions. It‚Äôs usually shaped by hand or using very simple tools like thin metal rods. it‚Äôs much thicker and has less of a bite than both egg and dried pasta. Often enough it‚Äôs a bit pasty and quite irregular in thickness, especially if the person who made it is not very good.  Making egg and durum wheat pasta is a regional tradition. Shapes and types of pasta are extremely local and sometimes you can find relevant differences even between two neighboring small towns. I expect to find these types of pasta only in regional cuisine restaurants. One such restaurant may have a sfoglina (the professional who handmakes pasta for a restarant), but this sfolgina will only be adept at making her local pasta, not the full range of above types. So at a Pugliese upscale restaurant I may be happy to find a sfoglina making orecchiette, but I would not expect this person to be adept at making egg pasta, which requires different techniques. But I would much better eexpect they get their pasta from an artisan with a dedicated laboratory. Durum wheat dried pasta  Dried pasta is a completely different product. It is made with a very tough dough with only durum wheat and water,and can‚Äôt be hand shaped (it‚Äôs far too tought). The dough must be kneaded for a much longer time (half an hour), requires special machinery to create the shapes, and must be slowly dried at room temperature in perfect conditions of humidity to get the final bite of the product.  Dried pasta is a long-lasting ingredient invented by the Arabs over a millennium ago, it can be kept in a cupboard (no refrigeration required) and derives its characteristics from top quality flour, the use of appropriate bronze dies (teflon dies are cheaper and do not produce a pasta that‚Äôs as good), and very slow drying process. Slow drying process means that the pasta needs to rest for 2‚Äì3 days before being cooked. Now,  what restaurant has the space, money and time to set up a whole pasta making plant?  If you owned a really upscale restaurant you may want to hire a sfloglina to make some fresh pasta shapes: all the sfoglina needs is a small room separate from the kitchen and conditioned to prevent heat and humidity, and a wooden board. In order to serve homemade dried pasta like spaghetti or maccheroni you would have to set up a small factory (dough room, die room, drying chamber, packaging) that will have to work every single day, making pasta 2‚Äì3 days in advance at least. Now since the machnes need a set up to make the various shapes, you also have to plan for making a different shape every day, so that you can store enough pasta of said shape, before moving on to the next shape. Besides, if you are setting up such a tiny fafctory, you may not have access to the best machines. You will have to settle for smaller and less efficient machines, that produce pasta that is not as good. So, why making your own dried pasta and not opt to buy really good quality dried pasta from a reputable brand?",https://www.quora.com/If-you-go-to-an-Italian-Restaurant-would-you-expect-the-pasta-to-be-made-fresh-or-from-a-packet,I have a friend who makes fresh pasta and I make the Italian sauce. It's a great combination. Fresh pasta is delicious and something u have to try. If you ever go to a place that makes its own pasta go there. GO TO THE RAVIOLI HOUSE IN WILDWOOD NEW JERSEY. ALL THE PASTA IS MADE FRESH DAILY. I LOVE IT,"My restaurant, in Berlin, produce fresh durum wheat (semola di grano duro) pasta. We own 2 table top extruders and we produce many different shapes both long and short. We don't dry the pasta so we can cook it very fast (having slightly less than the 30 % of water in the dough). Alice Twain if it happens you come to Berlin you will be very welcome!!! I want to add that we produce ravioli with the same dough and they are delicious. What I notice, working every given day with durum wheat semola (not rimacinata, bigger grains) is that you fiscally can't, without the help of a machine, mold it into shape.",,,
Italian Restaurant,What is the best Italian restaurant franchise?,"Good Italian restaurant franchise is impossible. Franchising and Italian cuisine are mutally contradictory.
Italian food is a result of local products, often seasonal, local tradition and a talent of a particular cook. And for every Italian the world best food is that of his home place. What‚Äôs more, the best food is cooked by his  mamma . Next is food in a  trattoria  round the corner, cooked by the owner himself or, even better, by the owner‚Äôs  mamma.  Food outside the home place is something at least suspicious, food from the other regions of Italy is laughable, and food in other countries is not food at all.
So the idea of the chain of restaurants serving identical Italian food in every place in the world is out of the question. The food may at most pretend to be Italian but it will never be Italian, and it will be abomination and insult for the common sense.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Italian-restaurant-franchise,My mamma's food is honestly nothing to rave about.

Italian Restaurant,How does Olive Garden compare to an authentic Italian restaurant?,"Well‚Ä¶. I consider Olive Garden to be the Disneyland version of an Italian restaurant.  (Tour of Italy and Logo composted from original images from OlveGarden.com) I mean, look at this‚Ä¶ the lovely Princess Ariel, the Little Mermaid, that everyone knows and loves from Disney.  (from YouTube - DisneyMusicEVO    ) I mean, to really understand what I mean, here‚Äôs the real Little Mermaid of myth and legend‚Ä¶  (from wikipedia    ) Just to let you know, no the mermaid does not end up with the Prince and almost kills the guy when he marries another woman. She does end up being a good spirit with a chance to earn a way into heaven if she helps people for 300 years. Oh yes, the mermaid is MUTE the entire time, so no singing. So, what exactly does any of this has to do with Olive Garden‚Ä¶. Well, Olive Garden is effectively a Disney-fied version of an authentic Italian restaurant‚Ä¶ or really SEVERAL Italian restaurants from several regions. While OG claims that they‚Äôre Tuscany inspired, they draw upon several regions, and then Americanize it by tripling the portions or make up new ‚Äúitalian-ish‚Äù creations entirely as it goes. With its unlimited (chewy fluffy) breadsticks (unlike true Italian crunchy ones) and salads, then just loads and loads of cream and cheese, it‚Äôs like constantly being on a ride made out of pasta and sauces. where you can ride until you get sick or fall asleep out of pure caloric inhalation. More importantly, they get to dictate to a clueless public on what the real story is, just like in a Disney movie where the story is always a happy ending. So no, Olive Garden isn‚Äôt an authentic Italian restaurant. But just like in Disneyland, they strive to make it the happiest italian-ish place on Earth.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-Olive-Garden-compare-to-an-authentic-Italian-restaurant,"While I agree with your describing Olive Garden as a Disneyfication - the impeccable gnocchi I had Bologna ruined it for me everywhere else - I bristle at your stating at their ability ‚Äúto dictate to a clueless public on what the real story is.‚Äù The public isn‚Äôt clueless; clues to authenticity can be found in any city‚Äôs Little Italy neighborhood. I think the phrase ‚Äúwillfully ignorant‚Äù is more accurate, and Olive Garden is simply happy to feed, both literally and figuratively, that ignorance.","Ugh. Maybe it varies by region, but in these parts (KY), their pasta has the firmness of udon.",Is the ‚Äòreal‚Äô mermaid as cute as Ariel though?,,

Ibanez Series S,What was the longest doubleheader?,"Minor League Baseball Edit The record for the  most innings ever played in a single professional game  is 33 which occurred in  1981  in a  Minor League Baseball  game between the  Pawtucket Red Sox  and the  Rochester Red Wings , Triple-A affiliates of the  Boston Red Sox  and the  Baltimore Orioles , respectively. [6]  Each team had a future  Hall of Famer  on its roster:  Wade Boggs  for Pawtucket and  Cal Ripken Jr.  for Rochester. Major League Baseball Edit The longest game by innings in  Major League Baseball  was a 1‚Äì1 tie in the  National League  between the  Boston Braves  and the  Brooklyn Robins  in 26 innings, at  Braves Field  in  Boston  on May 1,  1920 . [7]  It had become too dark to see the ball (fields did not have lights yet and the sun was setting), and the game was considered a draw. Played rapidly by modern standards, those 26 innings were completed in 3 hours and 50 minutes. As was the custom, the first pitch was thrown at 3:00 p.m.; home plate umpire  Barry McCormick  called the game as lights began appearing in the windows of buildings across the  Charles River , just before 7:00 p.m. The longest  American League  game, and tied for the longest major league game by innings which ended with one team winning, was a 7‚Äì6 victory by the  Chicago White Sox  over the  Milwaukee Brewers  in 25 innings, at  Comiskey Park  in  Chicago  in  1984 . The game began at 7:30 p.m. on May 8, 1984, and after scoring early runs both teams scored twice in the 8th inning; but the game was suspended after 17 innings with the score tied 3‚Äì3 due to a league  curfew  rule prohibiting an inning from beginning after 12:59 a.m. The game was continued the following evening, May 9, 1984, and both teams scored three times in the 21st inning to make the score 6‚Äì6; finally, in the bottom of the 25th, the White Sox'  Harold Baines  hit a  walk-off home run  to end the contest.  Tom Seaver  was the  winning  pitcher in  relief . [8]  A regularly scheduled game followed, meaning both nights saw 17 innings played; Seaver also started, and won, the second game 5‚Äì4. The official time of the entire 25-inning game was 8 hours, 6 minutes, also a major league record. [9] On September 11,  1974 , the  St. Louis Cardinals  won a marathon night game against the  New York Mets , after 7 hours 4 minutes, and 25 innings; this, the longest  National League  contest, is also tied for the longest game played to a decision in major league history. Two Mets errors led to the Cardinals' winning run, starting with an errant pickoff throw that allowed  Bake McBride  to scamper all the way around from first. St. Louis won, 4‚Äì3. [10]  The Mets went to the plate 103 times, a record in a major league game; the Cards were not far behind with 99 plate appearances. All told, a record 175 official at-bats were recorded, with a major-league record 45 runners stranded. Only a thousand fans were still at  Shea Stadium  when the game ended at 3:13 a.m. on September 12. Unlike the American League, the National League had no curfew. This was the longest game played to a decision without a suspension. [11] [12] On April 15,  1968 , the  Houston Astros  defeated the Mets 1‚Äì0 in a 24-inning game at the  Houston Astrodome . The 6-hour, 6-minute contest, which ended with the Astros'  Bob Aspromonte  hitting a grounder through the legs of Mets shortstop  Al Weis  in the bottom of the 24th, remains the longest  shutout  game in major league history. It also had the most scoreless innings (23) in a major-league game. [13] The longest American League game to end in a tie was a 24-inning contest between the  Detroit Tigers  and  Philadelphia Athletics  on July 21,  1945 . The teams were tied 1‚Äì1 when the game was called due to darkness at  Shibe Park ; the Tigers'  Les Mueller  had pitched a record 192‚ÅÑ3 innings, giving up one run before being taken out in the 20th inning. The longest game to end in a scoreless tie was a National League contest between the  Cincinnati Reds  and  Brooklyn Dodgers  on September 11,  1946 . The teams went 19 innings before darkness fell at Brooklyn's  Ebbets Field , forcing the game to be called on account of darkness. In the American League, the longest 0‚Äì0 game was played between the  Washington Senators  and  Detroit Tigers  on July 16,  1909 . The game was called after 18 innings due to darkness at  Bennett Park  in Detroit. The longest scoreless period within a completed game came in the April 15, 1968 game between the Astros and Mets which remained scoreless after 23 innings. The  Washington Senators  became the first team in Major League history to play multiple games of at least 20 innings in a season when they defeated the  Minnesota Twins  9‚Äì7 in 20 innings on August 9, 1967, after winning a 22-inning game over the Chicago White Sox on June 12 of that year. This feat would later be accomplished by the 1971  Oakland Athletics  who had games of 21 and 20 innings and the 1989  Los Angeles Dodgers  who played two 22-inning contests. [14] The longest  doubleheader  in Major League history was on May 31,  1964 . The  San Francisco Giants  beat the  New York Mets  5‚Äì3 in nine innings in the day's first game at  Shea Stadium , and then won the nightcap 8‚Äì6 after 23 innings. The two games lasted a combined nine hours, 52 minutes. The Mets'  Ed Kranepool  played in all 32 innings of the two games; Kranepool had been called up to the team that day after having played in both games of a doubleheader the day before for their Triple-A club in Buffalo. On April 5,  2012 , the  Toronto Blue Jays  beat the  Cleveland Indians  7‚Äì4 in 16 innings. The five-hour, 14-minute game was the longest  Opening Day  game in Major League history. [15] On June 8,  2013 , the  Toronto Blue Jays  beat the  Texas Rangers  4‚Äì3 in 18 innings while the  Miami Marlins  beat the  New York Mets  2‚Äì1 in 20 innings. This was the second time in Major League history that two games of 18 innings or more were played on same day; [16]  the first was August 15, 2006. [17] On September 21, 2013, just past 2:00 a.m., the  Tampa Bay Rays  defeated the  Baltimore Orioles  5‚Äì4 in 18 innings in a game that had started at 7:10 p.m. the night before. [18] In 2013, the  Arizona Diamondbacks  set a major league record by playing 77 extra innings. [19]  This broke the record of 76 extra innings played by the  Minnesota Twins  in  1969 . On August 10, 2014, at 12:39 a.m. the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim defeated the Boston Red Sox 5‚Äì4 in 19 innings in a game that had started at 6 p.m. the night before. [20]  Albert Pujols' walk-off homer was quickly reviewed, per Boston's request, but the call was confirmed. That same day the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Detroit Tigers 6‚Äì5 in a 19-inning game of their own, Both teams used all their available bench reserves as well as their entire available bullpen, Toronto even used starting pitcher  Marcus Stroman  as a pinch runner at one point. Tigers starter  Rick Porcello  would be credited with the loss after coming into the game in the 18th inning. Toronto reliever  Chad Jenkins  would get the win after pitching 6 innings of relief (an unusually long outing for a reliever) with  Jos√© Bautista  hitting a walk-off single to score  Munenori Kawasaki  to win the game. Toronto starter  R.A. Dickey  had begun warming up in the bullpen in the top of the 19th and may have come on in relief had the game gone to 20 innings. On April 11, 2015, the  Boston Red Sox  defeated the  New York Yankees  6‚Äì5 in 19 innings at  Yankee Stadium . The game began at 7:05 p.m. on April 10, and ended at 2:13 a.m., after 6 hours and 49 minutes of play. The length of the game prompted a  Twitter  joke during the game by Yankees' media personality Mark Feinsand at 12:10 a.m. on the 11th regarding  Mark Teixeira 's birthday:  Mark Teixeira was 34 when this game began. He's now 35. #TrueStory. [21] On May 28, 2017, the  Tampa Bay Rays  defeated the  Minnesota Twins  8‚Äì6, in a 15-inning, 6-hour-and-26-minute game. Both teams combined had 115 at-bats, 33 hits and 21 strikeouts. In 2020, MLB added a temporary rule that extra innings begin with a runner on second base. On July 24, 2020, The  Oakland Athletics  defeated the  Los Angeles Angels  7‚Äì3 in the first extra-inning game under this rule. [22]  In the top of the 10th inning,  Shohei Ohtani  of the Angels was placed on second base, and was thrown out in a rundown. In the bottom of the 10th inning,  Marcus Semien  was placed on second base, and would score on a walk-off grand slam. This rule is also used in doubleheader games that end tied after seven innings. Notable postseason extra-inning games Edit In October 1999 the Grand Single game 5 of the  1999 NLCS  was won when, with the Bases loaded in the bottom of the 15th inning,  Robin Ventura  of the New York Mets, who had hit 2 Grand Slams in one game earlier in the year in the same game, hit what seemed to be another when the ball went over the wall. His fellow Mets teammates would not let him get even to second base. So according to the rules only one run was allowed to score making it a 4-3 win over the  Atlanta Braves . [23] Learn more This section  needs additional citations for  verification .  (October 2018) The longest postseason game by innings in MLB history is 18 innings, which has happened three times. The first 18-inning contest was played between the  Atlanta Braves  and the  Houston Astros  on October 9, 2005. In Game 4 of a  National League Division Series  in  Houston , the Braves (who were trailing the series 2‚Äì1 and facing elimination) took a 6‚Äì1 lead into the 8th inning. A  grand slam  by  Lance Berkman  in the bottom of the 8th brought the score to 6‚Äì5, and with two outs in the bottom of the 9th,  Brad Ausmus  homered to tie the game and send it to extra innings. The score remained deadlocked at 6‚Äì6 until the 18th, when the Astros'  Chris Burke  (who entered the game in the 9th inning as a pinch runner) hit a walk-off home run to left to win it, sending Houston to the  NLCS .  Roger Clemens , who was brought in to  pinch-hit  in the 15th and pitched the last three innings in relief, was credited as the winning pitcher in the 5-hour, 50-minute contest.  Adam LaRoche  and  Tim Hudson  played in both of the first two 18-inning games. This one as Atlanta Braves and the second one as opposing sides of one another with Hudson pitching in both games as the visiting team's starting pitcher. It is the longest winner in a potential clinching game in baseball history. The second 18-inning game was Game 2 of the  2014 National League Division Series , with the visiting  San Francisco Giants  winning 2‚Äì1 over the  Washington Nationals . The game ended just after midnight on October 5, 2014, and lasted 6 hours 23 minutes. The Nationals had been leading 1‚Äì0 with two out in the ninth inning, with starter  Jordan Zimmermann  one out away from a complete-game shutout. Following a decision by manager  Matt Williams  to remove Zimmermann with two out after he walked  Joe Panik , Washington closer  Drew Storen  gave up a single to Giants catcher  Buster Posey  and an RBI double to  Pablo Sandoval , scoring Panik to tie the game 1‚Äì1. Posey was thrown out at the plate trying to score the second San Francisco run on Sandoval's double. After  Sergio Romo  retired the Nationals in order in the bottom half, the game went into extra innings. There was no further scoring until Giants first baseman  Brandon Belt  led off the top of the 18th inning with a home run.  Hunter Strickland , a September call-up, recorded the save. Of the three 18 innings games this is the only one to go the full 18 innings. The third and most recent 18-inning game was Game 3 of the  2018 World Series . It was played on October 26, 2018, between the  Boston Red Sox  and  Los Angeles Dodgers  at  Dodger Stadium . The Dodgers took a 1‚Äì0 lead in the 3rd inning when  Joc Pederson  homered off of Boston starter  Rick Porcello . The Red Sox tied the game in the top of the 8th when  Jackie Bradley Jr.  hit a solo home run off of Dodgers closer  Kenley Jansen . The game remained deadlocked at 1 until the 13th inning when  Brock Holt  scored on a throwing error by Dodgers reliever  Scott Alexander . The Dodgers subsequently tied it again at 2 in the bottom of the inning, when  Max Muncy  scored on a throwing error by Red Sox second baseman  Ian Kinsler  (who had entered the game in the 10th inning as a pinch runner). The score remained 2‚Äì2 until the bottom of the 18th, when Muncy (who had missed a walk-off home run in the 15th inning by mere inches) hit a walk-off solo home run off of Red Sox pitcher  Nathan Eovaldi  (who was in his 7th inning of relief). The winning pitcher for the Dodgers was  Alex Wood . With a duration of 7 hours and 20 minutes, this was also the longest postseason game by time in MLB history. [24] The  1986 National League Championship Series  was notable for its two climactic extra-inning games. After the  Houston Astros  and the  New York Mets  split the first four games of the series, the Mets won Game 5 in 12 innings and Game 6 in 16 innings to claim the pennant. [25] The  1986 American League Championship Series  between the  Boston Red Sox  and the  California Angels  featured a dramatic game where the Angels were leading 3 games to 1 and leading 5‚Äì4 in game 5, one strike away from the first pennant in franchise history, only for Red Sox's  Dave Henderson  hit a two-run home run off Angels closer  Donnie Moore  in the top of the ninth inning to give the Red Sox the lead. The Angels tied it in the bottom half but in the top of the 11th, Henderson's sacrifice fly off Moore proved to be the winning margin and the Angels lost the game. The series returned to  Boston  and the Angels were outscored a combined 18‚Äì5 in games 6 and 7 to lose the pennant. Game 6 of the  1986 World Series  between the  New York Mets  and  Boston Red Sox  went into extra innings as well. The Red Sox scored 2 runs in the top of the 10th inning to take a 5‚Äì3 lead and then got two quick outs with no one on base in the bottom of the 10th. With the Red Sox one out away from their first world championship in 68 years, reliever  Calvin Schiraldi  gave up three straight singles to cut the lead to one run with runners on first and third. Red Sox manager  John McNamara  replaced Schiraldi with Bob Stanley, who then threw a two-strike wild pitch to Mookie Wilson to allow the tying run to score and move the other runner to second base. The wild pitch was particularly notable in that it completely turned the tables on the Red Sox from what they had done while facing the Angels weeks earlier, as they themselves had now blown a situation in which they were one strike away from winning the series. Wilson subsequently hit a ground ball to first base that rolled through the legs of first baseman  Bill Buckner  to allow the winning run to score from second base, sending the Series to a Game 7 where the Mets completed the comeback. Had Buckner not committed this error, the game would have either remained tied with runners on first and third for the next batter (if Wilson was safe) or would have gone to an 11th inning (if Wilson had been out). The  1980 National League Championship Series , played between the Houston Astros and the  Philadelphia Phillies , had four of its five games go to extra innings. The Astros won Games 2 and 3 in 10 and 11 innings respectively, while the Phillies took Games 4 and 5 in 10 innings each. Game 6 of the  2011 World Series  invokes echoes of 1986. In the bottom of the 9th inning, the  Texas Rangers  were one strike away from winning their first World Series when  David Freese  hit a two-run triple to tie the game 7‚Äì7 and send the game to extra innings. In the 10th,  Josh Hamilton  hit a two-run home run to give the Rangers a 9‚Äì7 lead, but the Cardinals responded with two runs to tie the game again at 9. The game ended in the 11th inning when Freese led off with a walk-off solo home run. Just like the Mets did in 1986, the Cardinals went on to win Game 7 and the championship. The  2012 American League Division Series  between the  Baltimore Orioles  and the  New York Yankees  had back-to-back extra-inning games, going 12 and 13 innings respectively. The Yankees won Game 3 on a  walk-off home run  by  Ra√∫l Iba√±ez  and the Orioles returned the favor the next night by winning Game 4. In the  1995 American League Division Series , the  Seattle Mariners  and Yankees battled in Game 2 in 15 innings. The Yankees won the game on a two-run walk-off home run by  Jim Leyritz , setting the record for longest game in MLB postseason history by time until 2005. In Game 5, the Mariners won the game and the series in 11 innings on  Edgar Mart√≠nez 's famous  double  that scored  Ken Griffey Jr.  Until 2011, this was the only LDS game 5 in either league to go into extra innings. The  2014 American League Wild Card Game  featured the first extra-inning game in its third year of postseason existence, was won by the  Kansas City Royals  over the  Oakland Athletics  in 12 innings. The longest Game 7 in postseason history was during the  1924 World Series  where the  Washington Senators  beat the  New York Giants  4‚Äì3 in 12 innings to claim the title. The longest ""winner take all"" game (defined as the final game of a postseason series, in which the winning team clinches the title or advances to the next round while the loser is eliminated from the postseason) in MLB postseason history is the 2018 National League Wild-Card Game, won by the  Colorado Rockies  over the  Chicago Cubs  2‚Äì1 in 13 innings. All-Star Game Edit The longest major league  All-Star Game  by time was played on July 15,  2008  at  Yankee Stadium , with the American League winning 4‚Äì3 in 15 innings after four hours, 50 minutes.  Michael Young  hit the walk-off sacrifice fly to win it. [26]  This was the first time in All-Star game history that the AL won an All-Star Game in extra innings. The previous nine times the National League went 8‚Äì0‚Äì1 in extra-inning games. The All-Star Game of July 11,  1967  at  Anaheim Stadium  also lasted 15 innings, but was considerably shorter in terms of elapsed time. The All-Star Game of July 9,  2002  at  Miller Park  was controversially declared a 7‚Äì7 tie after 11 innings, when both teams ran out of available pitchers. [27] World Series Edit Over the history of the  World Series , 63 games have gone to extra innings, setting the following innings-related records. [28] Most extra innings  played in a  World Series game : 9 ( 2018, game 3 ). Further, game 3 was the longest World Series game played in terms of elapsed time. [29] Most extra innings  played  over the course of a World Series : 9 (2018). This record, distinct from the above, was also set by the large number of extra innings in 2018's game 3 alone, eclipsing the previous record 8 extra innings logged in games  1  and  5  of the  2015 Series . Most innings  played  over the course of a World Series : 75 ( 1912 ). 1912 was one of seven historically unusual Series: four ( 1903 ,  1919 ,  1920 ,  1921 ) were best-of-nine contests, and three ( 1907 ,  1912 ,  1922 ) were best-of-seven contests which each had one tie game apiece. In the 1912 Series,  game 2  concluded as an 11-inning tie and the Series-deciding  game 8  went for 10 innings, [30]  padding the Series' total inning count to 75. Most innings  played  over the course of a standard World Series : 69 ( 1924 ,  1991 ). ""Standard"" denotes best-of-seven Series which had no tie games, excluding the seven above Series. 1924's games  1  and  7  each went for 12 innings, while 1991's games  3 ,  6  and  7  went for 12, 11 and 10 innings, respectively. [31] [32] Most games running to extra innings , played  over the course of a World Series : 3 (1991). No other Series has had more than two games running to extra innings.

Tricking,"What are some interesting tricks to read a person you just met? What are some interesting or nontrivial ways to read and evaluate their personality, motivations, and weaknesses within 5 minutes in order to gain some leverage over them?","1. Appearance: Are they well dressed? Are they showing too much cleavage? Perhaps they're trying to impress someone. Dressed in sweats and an old t-shirt at Coldstone? Breakup? For men: what do their nails look like? Do they take care of themselves? Long and dirty toenails probably aren't very hygienic.  2. Tone of voice: Is it shaky? Are they upset or do they just have social anxiety? If it's the former, then look at their eyes - if it's wet then yeah, they most likely are upset about something. A ""Hey, are you ok?"" works wonders. Is their voice affirmative? They are probably very confident. Or feel very comfortable with their surroundings. 3. Their walk: Are they just shuffling by and looking at their feet? They probably lack some confidence and won't usually be the ones to strike a conversation.  4. Gestures: Rubbing their temples? Running their fingers through their hair? Rubbing palms? These all signal stress. If they bring their hand up to rub their neck (front or back), they are probably feeling some discomfort. If their arms are crossed, they're not feeling too sociable.  5. Facial clues: Clenching their jaw or furrowing their eyebrows? Lips pursed? These are also signs of stress or worry. If they're squinting during a conversation, then they're trying particularity hard to understand you. There's a good chance that something else is occupying their mind.  6.

Tricking,What are some tips and tricks for getting bigger portion sizes at Chipotle?,"I enjoy seeing the faces of the Chipotle cashier when they see how heavy the burrito is they just put in a bag. I discovered this by accident. It all started because I didn't want my burritos to break as I ate them (solved by step 1) and then found there was plenty of space to add additional burrito stuffings. Ask for a double wrapped burrito. Choose rice and beans. You can ask for black and pinto beans (one at a time) and get a lot more. Ask for half and half on a meat type (harder to measure and you'll get more usually). Ask for fajita vegetables. One at a time (as in wait until they finish the step before requesting the next one) I ask: Mild salsa (voluminous) Hot salsa Sour cream Corn Cheese Lettuce Some more lettuce You can even go back and ask for any extra salsa. Thats it. Because it's double wrapped, it will fit nicely on the tortilla surface while the wonderful Chipotle burrito artist is adding ingredients. It is not until they start to wrap it that they realize how massive an endeavor closing it up will be. It usually involves them trying once, readjusting, looking over at the cashier who is usually staring in amazement (I've never been looked at directly in a mocking way, I have never gotten the impression they are upset in any way, just amused and focused on the challenge before them) and barely closing it and wrapping it with multiple sheets of tin foil. You now have at least two, maybe three meals, with a burrito the size and weight of a small child and for the price of a regular burrito. This is how one survives on a startup budget. If there is interest I'd be glad to go out and take a picture of this super burrito. *UPDATE* I took a quick trip to chipotle to be able to snap a picture. I did all the above except only one type of bean, a little corn, and not much lettuce. So this one could have been much bigger. I'll try again in a couple of days and post it!  Update 2 I just went to Qdoba and had similar success. I have a hunch, with how many free things they give (like guac and queso), that you could make this thing way bigger than Chipotle. I tired to add some chips for size reference. ",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-for-getting-bigger-portion-sizes-at-Chipotle,I always get the Burrito bowl and then ask for a tortilla on the side (which is free). I‚Äôll have to try and engineer me a Burrito-Child at some point‚Ä¶,"Please post an UNWRAPPED picture. Seeing aluminum foil is not that interesting. I doubt that the store minds when someone heaps stuff up like that. I regularly get TWO layers of tomatoes on my Subway sandwiches along with lots of the other stuff. They see me coming and know what I‚Äôm going to say. They‚Äôre still making a profit on your purchase, though less of a profit. Many restaurants have about a 20% food cost to price ratio, where labor and everything else eat into the rest. If it‚Äôs a choice of letting you get a huge burrito or having you not come in at all, they‚Äôll choose having you as a customer every time.","If anybody does do this, don't get mad at the poor line person who can't wrap it because it's stuffed with extra of everything. It's incredibly annoying to wrap big burritos especially during rush hour, and when you get mad at us because we can't physically wrap the monster it doesn't help. Doing this during rush hour when there's 30 people behind is also a pain. If you want a burrito that weighs a ton, just go to Freebirds. And if you're getting a big burrito, please don't get extra hot sauce with extra barbacoa, queso, guac, and extra sour cream. The thing is going to fall apart before you can eat it and soggy burritos are the worst to roll.","You‚Äôre forgetting a key step, always ask for ‚ÄúDouble Rice‚Äù they don‚Äôt charge for it and that adds some serious volume as well!","The half and half meat is key, because they give you like .75 and .75.

Tricking,What are some mind blowing magic tricks?,"OK, with those parameters, TRY THIS simple and extremely effective card trick I call THE ROYAL HOTEL. (It‚Äôs much simpler than it appears, writing it all out here with patter)
The trick only uses 16 cards, so start by taking out all the Kings, the Queens, the Aces, and the Jacks. Put 4 kings face-up on the table, about 2 inches apart, in a square. Then put a queen on top of each king. Then an ace, then a jack. As you‚Äôre doing this, you say, ‚ÄúThis is a story about the time the 4 kings went to the Royal Hotel. Each king brought his royal queen with him. Now the drama, in the middle of the night they were robbed; 4 robbers/aces broke into each room. Luckily they‚Äôd brought their knights with them (as you put the jacks down), and the knights came to try to rescue them.‚Äù
 Now turn each pile face-down, and stack them all on top of each other into 1 pile of 16 cards, as you say ‚ÄúBut just when the knights showed up, someone turned out the lights in the Royal Hotel, and they all piled out into the hallway.‚Äô Now you cut and complete the cut a number of times while you say ‚Äúand there was a big fight. But it was dark, and nobody knew who was hitting who.‚Äù After doing a few cut & completes, you can let the spectator do the same. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times you cut, but I suggest you do it 3 times, and let the spectator cut twice.
Now pick up the pile of 16 cards, and deal them, 1-at-a-time, back into 4 face-down piles, rotating around like you‚Äôre dealing 4 hands of a card game, as you say ‚ÄúBut somehow they all made it back to the different rooms, but they‚Äôd all got mixed up, and it was dark so nobody knew where they were going.‚Äù Then as you turn each pile face up for the surprise climax, you say, ‚ÄúBut the cool part was, when the lights came back on, all the kings were together in this room, the queens were all together in this room, the robbers were in this room, and the knights were together in THIS room!‚Äù You‚Äôll probably be amazed as you turn each pile over each one will be composed of 4 identical cards (like all 4 jacks, and you‚Äôll simply call out whatever each one is - ie. the jacks might be the first pile you turn over.)

Tricking,What are some life-saving health tricks and hacks?,"Hi, Here are few hacks/tricks which I have tried and sharing my experience on each of them. 1: Food activities: Caution:  Be careful before you start these below habits and also do not do it in one go.  Start with weekly once, twice per week, alternative days and then daily. Below are few which I have tried and are working as per my knowledge. 1: Eat  curry leaves  (~10 leaves) with little jeera daily morning in empty stomach. Benefits: Eyesight will improve and also white hair will be gone. My experience: My eyesight improved and now I am not using my specs (I was having 0.75 cylindrical number) and there was moderate change in my hair color. Start with 3 or 5 leaves. you will feel uneasiness in the beginning.  2: Drink  honey  daily morning empty stomach. Benefits: Most of the  sputum  will come out like crazy. Caution : Try to get original honey, any branded honey in my knowledge are fake. My experience: It helped me a lot and removed most of my sputum from lungs.  3: Eat or swallow  garlic  every morning: This helps in good blood circulation and also avoid heart related issues. My experience:  Caution  Do not eat a full piece of Garlic at first go. It is too painful and I am not sure about the consequences. First day when I eat a small piece of garlic, my chest part started paining like anything, heavy pain, its like some one is standing on my chest, after 5 hours the pain reduced. When I googled the pain means I have a block somewhere in the arteries. As per Ayurveda this is one of the best practice to get rid of heart disease.  Few things which I do. 1: Drink  more water  and start as soon as you wake up. How much water?? Until your urine turns to white from yellow color. Just make sure you are not dehydrated. 2: Try to use garlic, ginger, curry leaves, Jeera in most of your food items. 3:  Surya Namaskara : Start with ten and gradually increase. 4: Running. 5: Away from social media, try to be ONLINE only when required or really feeling lonely 6: Read books.

Tricking,What are psychology tricks to make us more disciplined?,"Here are 7 Psychology tricks to make you more disciplined: Don‚Äôt Wait for Motivation.  Everyone wants to be ‚Äúmotivated,‚Äù but in truth, you likely do 1000 tasks you hate for your employer every day. You don‚Äôt wait for motivation there, so why wait for yourself? Just sit down, form a plan, and get to work‚Ä¶here‚Äôs how‚Ä¶ Have a Small, Clear, Goal Every Day.  If you have something big you want for yourself, break it into small pieces and assign yourself a *really small and easy part of it* every day. I mean,  really easy ‚Ä¶ it might only take you 10 minutes or 15 minutes. For example - day one, you might choose an available domain name for your new business,  that‚Äôs it . The point is, you put it in your calendar and start small. But these small steps add up. Scale Efforts.  One you start simple like in step 2, and do this for a while, you‚Äôll find yourself  actually wanting  to do more.  This is where you are literally building momentum and self-discipline  because you‚Äôre seeing it pay off. When you start to feel that push? Start assigning yourself more‚Ä¶.something that takes 30 min or 40 min or even an hour.  Discipline is built, it isn‚Äôt automatic , so this is how you scale that process. Use Time Blocks.  That means assign a time for yourself every day (preferably early in the day), just to do  your  task. Block it out like a meeting, turn all distractors off or put them away, close all tabs that are unrelated. Whether your task is 10 minutes or an hour, make it a ritual to block out time and clear distractions before you begin‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a good habit to start early. Accountability.  It‚Äôs one thing to fail if no one knows about it, it‚Äôs quite another to fail in front of someone else. I‚Äôve done executive coaching for a long time, and one thing I do is hold people accountable for what they want to do. No one wants to come to my Friday meetings having not followed through. If you don‚Äôt get yourself a good coach - use someone else as an accountability partner‚Ä¶preferably someone also ambitious who is working on their own thing. Watch Your Language.  When you talk to yourself or others, don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúI hope to,‚Äù but say ‚ÄúI will.‚Äù These tweaks to your language make a difference. One sets you up for failure and an excuse, the other is taking charge of your outcome. Remove Weaknesses from Your Life.  Do you always get looped into Happy Hour after work? Have addictive apps that have you sucked in for hours at a time? Take away the unproductive things that suck your time and give your time to your goals. Sure‚Ä¶you can have fun‚Ä¶but maybe reserve happy hour for Fridays, and  only after  you‚Äôve hit all your personal goals for the week.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-psychology-tricks-to-make-us-more-disciplined,"Guess what?

Tricking,What are the best psychological ways to get a girl interested in you?,"If someone genuinely likes you, there are  many  clues. None of them psychological  tricks  per se, but all of them quite clear indicators of her interest. When you talk to her, she gives you her undivided attention. She engages with what you say. When you give her space to talk, she continues the conversation instead of letting it die. After the awkward phase at the beginning of not knowing what to talk to you about, which is totally normal, she begins conversations with you. She makes humorous observations about what you‚Äôre talking about to make you laugh. She is gauging whether you have real interest in her. She mirrors your body language. She looks like she‚Äôs paying attention and interested in what you‚Äôre saying. She laughs in all the right places without cues. She smiles at you. When you give her eye contact, she holds your eyes with hers. She‚Äôs not a hard ass about it like she‚Äôs challenging you, she does it pleasantly. She may avert their eyes when she smiles as if she‚Äôs shy. She blushes when you complement her. You find it easy to make her giggle. She doesn‚Äôt pull away when you touch her. If you lean into her space she doesn‚Äôt pull away, instead she may lean in. When you ask what she‚Äôs doing tonight, she tells you she doesn‚Äôt have any plans. She may actually have plans, but telling you indicates that even if she does, she‚Äôs willing to cancel them. When you ask for her number, she gives it to you. When you lean in tentatively for the kiss, she doesn‚Äôt pull away, she either meets you in the middle, or she bites her lip silently encouraging you to come the rest of the way. Unless of course she‚Äôs been trained by her immature friends that when you like someone, you play hard to get and act like a bitch towards them. In which case, ignore everything I just said. The only way to find out is to challenge her to a duel to the death (which is her idea of a date.)

Ibanez Series S,What are some of the reasons why Fender offers a lot of variations for the same guitars?," Fender offers a variety of guitars for one simple reason: sales. Let‚Äôs look at the big picture: Factories with big CNC routing machines (fancy word for computerized woodworking) reliably cut the same patterns for guitar bodies and necks. This is very similar to ‚Äúcookie cutting‚Äù only they are routed and not stamped. Factories from different parts of the world offer guitars in the USA for sale at different price-points in retail stores. No matter how much you have to spend, you can likely afford something that is offered. There will probably be more expensive models offered with upgrades that you want, which, will result in some people spending more money for their guitar. Subtle differences in parts and upgrades are preferred by different people and a variety of options increase the chance Fender has something you‚Äôll want to buy. Look at their website‚Äîyou can configure your own guitar for a reasonable price. From a manufacturing, marketing and sales perspective, this provides an impressive selection for your local music stores to choose from. Lets remember that stores have someone who orders the guitars they sell on their shelves, and they‚Äôll usually purchase products that they believe their customers will buy. But, beyond sales‚Ä¶ and  from a player‚Äôs perspective , there are different  era  guitars. A Stratocaster from the 50‚Äôs is different than what someone would expect from the 70‚Äôs. Without getting too involved with the particulars, let‚Äôs simply say that people develop preferences for designs from specific years. The pickups and the neck are usually the two critical pieces that people ‚Äúfret‚Äù over (pun intended). Typically speaking, you will find American Strats at the top tier, followed by Japan, Mexico, Indonesia, and China. To control the quality of the guitars to match the price point, you‚Äôll usually find cheaper or older parts on guitars that are not made in the USA. Without writing a dissertation on this one element, I‚Äôll simply suggest that American-made Strats often have the most modern configurations and highest prices; Mexican-made Strats often have parts that were used in American guitars from a previous production run, while Chinese guitars sometimes are made from cheaper wood and metals ‚Äî even though they look the same. It used to be a little easier buying a guitar from Fender  but since there are so many import companies offering a log of ‚Äúbang for your buck,‚Äù Fender has stepped up their quality control, lowered their prices on certain models and now they offer more variety. Why would they want to loose a sale to a competitor?  Let‚Äôs take the ‚ÄúPlayer Series‚Äù for example. The  Player Series MSRP is $699.  This brings the price of an American Strat to roughly what someone would have paid for a MIM or MIJ Strat just a few years ago. Since American Strats are marketed as legacy products, this price is relatively affordable for an intermediate player.  If you prefer a more vintage configuration, you can pay $1899 for an  American Original , which simply means that the guitar is manufactured with specific options that make it more true to a specific era. I‚Äôm using Strats as an example, but they offer other models in this series. They are mostly for people who want a classic finish, a vintage neck and period-correct finishes. Let‚Äôs remember that there are people who believe that the color of your guitar and the finish can impact the way it sounds after it‚Äôs amplified. Is it worth paying that much more? I personally don‚Äôt think so. They‚Äôre simply guitars from different production runs with different parts screwed into them. It‚Äôs really not that big of a difference in the grand scheme of things. I find it interesting that the MIJ (Made in Japan) FSR (Fender Special Run) 50s Stratocaster is no longer available, but, for only costing $799, I‚Äôm not surprised. Lets take a look at this Telecaster:  This  Thinline Telecaster  can be purchased for only $2k. that‚Äôs right, for only $2,000 you can buy a lightweight telecaster with a small handful of electronics bolted on with pickups (just magnets and wire, folks) designed by Tim Shaw. Interestingly, lets say you didn‚Äôt want to spend $2k, and you had a bit less to spend but were looking to play a Fender guitar. Fender has something to hook the new guitarists as well - and this time, they put together an offering with a vintage neck and a bone nut with humbucking pickups that, quite frankly, sound great.  You can have these specs if you move over to an Indonesian-made Squire that costs 1/4 the price with slightly different electronics but a very similar configuration. You‚Äôll see some variances in quality control in ‚Äúreal life‚Äù examples but if you were to play them side by side, you‚Äôd question the $1,550 difference in cost. Why is the cost so much different? There are a few variables related to cost that substantiate a price difference. The first is that American labor costs a lot more. With that in mind, most of the parts on the Squire are  designed  by Fender but manufactured overseas. The wood and metal used may be slightly inferior, but not all that much. Aside from the cost of labor being cheaper in Indonesia, the quality control is much different also‚Äîit‚Äôs common to see flaws from the factory. This means that fewer parts are being wasted during the manufacturing process, which helps the factory keep the price per unit down. That‚Äôs why you may see people spending time trying to find ‚Äúa good one‚Äù ‚Äî but there were certain years that MIA Fenders had spotty quality control too. The reason why there are so many variances  is simply to ensure people can buy what they want. That‚Äôs right, to ensure you can find something to buy ‚Äî and all of the fancy different configurations keep you shopping Fender and also reduce the chance of you shopping the competition. Once you realize you can buy an Ibanez or Yamaha for a fraction of the cost, Fender may have lost you as a customer‚Äîbut let‚Äôs be honest?  For  less than the cost  of an entry-level MIA Stratocaster, you can buy a this Indonesian Yamaha Pacifica which features premium upgrades that include a coil-tapped humbucker, Graphtech nut and saddles and locking tuners. The Yamaha isn‚Äôt a Stratocaster, but if it had the Fender name and was made in USA, you would probably pay $1,599.99 for the same guitar because a couple alternate parts were screwed on. Lets be honest‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs something magical about the name ‚ÄúFender Stratocaster‚Äù that tickles the mind of most guitarists. It‚Äôs the power of marketing and branding. Fender has been around since the 1950s and is considered a legacy product because it‚Äôs ‚ÄúMade in the USA‚Äù. The ironic part is that there was a period of time where the production of American Strats were halted and the model was outsourced to Fender Japan while Fender America retooled their factories. These subtle, and not-so-subtle differences contribute to the variety of guitars offered by Fender today. There‚Äôs also a market for reissues, and that includes guitars that are designed to emulate the look and sound of a guitar that a popular musician may have played, such as the Eric Johnson or Eric Clapton Strat. In other words, if you want it ‚Äî they‚Äôll probably sell it. Fender offers a wide variety of guitars to keep you as a customer, and so they don‚Äôt loose sales to companies who make pretty decent copies of their original design.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-reasons-why-Fender-offers-a-lot-of-variations-for-the-same-guitars,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What's a good starter electric guitar? I was thinking of getting a Yamaha Pacifica or a Squier, but I'm not sure which type I should get (a lot of people recommend the PAC112V though).","There‚Äôs a ton of excellent choices these days. For $250-$350 you can get an outstanding used beginner guitar. Squire, Yamaha, Epiphone, Ibanez, and any number of import guitars. For something new, just add about $100 to the price. The key is something that feels good in your hands, light strings are good (e.g., 0.009‚Äôs), proper setup/intonation, not too heavy, etc. - something that just feels right. I‚Äôve been playing for 45 years and there‚Äôs nothing magical about where a guitar is made or who made it. Especially for a beginner. We have several Guitar Centers and Music-Go-Rounds in town and there‚Äôs no shortage of used gear for beginners. The reason I keep mentioning used is that if you really like playing and are progressing, then over time, you‚Äôll probably want to experiment with other guitar neck profiles and pickups, etc. With used gear you end up getting most of your money back if you sell it (you‚Äôll get 1/2 back on trade in at the music stores - still not a bad deal). And if you end up not liking playing guitar then you don‚Äôt have a huge investment tied up (and can still get most of your money back). Oh wait! You‚Äôll need an amp also! :-) Again, used is a great start on amps as well. I would avoid most of the sub $100 ‚Äúpractice‚Äù amps and amps that have a ton of models/effects. Something like the Spark sounds like a great idea, but people spend too much time fiddling with the settings instead of actually playing the guitar. So get a solid state or hybrid (tube preamp and SS power amp) amplifier with just some basic settings - clean and overdrive channels and other basic effects (reverb, delay, chorus and maybe a couple more), 5‚Äì15 watts, etc. There‚Äôs the Fender XD series, Vox Pathfinder, Peavey has a load of quality low wattage amps, etc. For a beginner, you want to focus on learning how to play the guitar‚Ä¶ later on you can learn how to play the effects. If you went the acoustic route, then you‚Äôre only talking $100 for a used Yamaha student nylon/classical guitar (that‚Äôs what I started on and still have/play it). Or something in the $150‚Äì250 for steel string. Your goal for the first 6 months of guitar should be solely focused on learning how to hold the guitar, picking methods, chords and learning some basic songs you like. If you‚Äôre still with it in 2 years and progressing (and have the money), then you probably would want to start looking at other options. BTW - I have about 15 guitars right now - from a 1948 Silverton to a 2011 Taylor 12 string. And I‚Äôve been through about 50 guitars in that last 20 years. I love the the thrill of getting new finds, paying for them by selling off something old, working/restoring/etc. But my main joy comes from playing. So don‚Äôt get too hung up on brands, where it‚Äôs made, what kind of wood, etc. It really doesn‚Äôt matter all that much - especially for a beginner (or an old timer).",https://www.quora.com/Whats-a-good-starter-electric-guitar-I-was-thinking-of-getting-a-Yamaha-Pacifica-or-a-Squier-but-Im-not-sure-which-type-I-should-get-a-lot-of-people-recommend-the-PAC112V-though,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Is there a benefit to using individual pedals over multi-effects machines?,"Yes, several, and one big drawback Some people like spring reverbs and will actually carry around a dedicated spring or even plate reverb, I like digital reverb myself, but I prefer analogue chorus, and certainly prefer analogue overdrive over any type of digital or modeled overdrive/distortion effects. In the same way I‚Äôve never been bothered by using digital delays, but there are a lot of guitarists who swear by analogue delays, specifically because their low-fi quality takes some bite off the delay and it blends into their personal sound better. Actual spring reverb ‚Äúfoot-pedal‚Äù:  Echoplex Analogue Tape Delay:  This has the top case removed to show the tape cartridge. There is never going to be a single box that combines the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (your personal preference) all in a single box. Some multi-effects units also limit your routing ability‚Äîwhat order your effects are in the signal chain‚Äîis your delay before or after the reverb? are delaying your reverb? or reverberating your delay? It really does matter. The crucial question for a lot of electric guitar players centers around your gain stages, and how they are driving one another. Warning: TL:DNR: I got a little carried away here going into gain stage theory, routing, and how Overdrive and Distortion actually works on a technical level, as well as its historical development over time. It‚Äôs down the rabbit hole, off on a tangent, almost an answer to a different question, but is the fundamental reason why tubes, transistors, and opamps haven‚Äôt been replaced by digital effects and amp-modeling. The only downside to all this is cost, mixing, matching, trying out different dedicated pedals and effects can be expensive ‚Ä¶ I highly recommend buying used, if you don‚Äôt overpay initially, you can generally always re-sell quality used gear for what you paid (minus shipping). When I first started playing I thought of amounts and types of overdrive in a very parallel way, it was one amount or type vs. a different amount, like channel switching amps ‚Ä¶ except even amps don‚Äôt always work in a parallel way, the classic Mesa Boogie Mark series amplifiers for instance, the amount of gain you have on your clean channel affects the amount of drive on the lead channel, to some extent the circuits are in series. Series overdrive is more obvious when it comes to running OD pedals into a clean channel. Let‚Äôs use an older style Fender amp as an example, like a Deluxe, or a Twin. Set to the same level of loudness, a deluxe will be driving the output section harder, this will add a shimmery slight break-up to your sound vs the Twin, a Deluxe only puts out around 20W (2X6v6 tubes), a Twin is 100W (4X6L6 tubes), you have to turn a Twin up much louder to get the output tubes to start breaking up (although you can even control this by reducing the AC voltage with a Variac, a la EVH‚Äôs ‚Äúbrown‚Äù Marshall tone). With loopers you can also create multiple parallel loops of serial gain stages for multiple complex signal chains. GigRig G2:  This is output tube overdrive, when you hear people talk about liking the way Fender amps distort/overdrive this is what they‚Äôre talking about, they‚Äôre never referring to the preamp distortion side of a Fender (the channel with the master volume, if it has one); it‚Äôs generally unusable. You actually want some of this output tube overdrive for your ‚Äúclean‚Äù sound, it adds some character and natural compression to your tone, ‚Äúclean‚Äù is a relative thing. So that‚Äôs one overdriven gain stage‚Äîactually it‚Äôs two tube gain stages‚Äîbut one gain knob; the first examples of players using overdrive was just turning up the original tweed models all the way up, the 50‚Äôs era ‚Äútweed‚Äù models had more power section overdrive because they didn‚Äôt have a baxendahl EQ section (bass and treble), they just had a single tone control. The 60‚Äôs blackface models added the baxendahl eq circuit, it‚Äôs more flexible, but it has a -22dB insertion loss when put in the circuit, this means there was 22dB less gain in the preamp section driving into the output section, this means it didn‚Äôt break-up as much as the 50‚Äôs era Tweed models did. Here‚Äôs a Tweed Deluxe (5e3):  Tone/Instrument Volume/Microphone Volume‚ÄîInstrument and Microphone were identical channels. Here‚Äôs a Blackface Deluxe:  Normal Channel: Volume/Treble/Bass Now the second channel is a Vibrato channel instead of ‚ÄúMic‚Äù, it‚Äôs the same as the normal channel but with speed and intensity controls added for the vibrato (it‚Äôs actually tremolo) ‚Ä¶ Fender didn‚Äôt come out with a preamp based distortion/overdrive channel with switching until quite a bit later (I don‚Äôt know when offhand, probably some time in the 80‚Äôs). So if we‚Äôre looking at our gain stage structure, we basically just have one preamp capable of overdriving one output section. What if we put another gain stage before the input of the amplifier? We could then overdrive the input/preamp stage in the amplifier. This was the next step of overdrive flavors historically speaking. Simply boosting the signal enough to overdrive the preamp section of the guitar amp, now we have two gain stages being overdriven in serial (one before the other), we‚Äôre distorting two different tube sections, a 12ax7 in the preamp (the second section‚Äî12ax7 are really two triode tubes in one little envelope), and then that is still overdriving the output tubes (2 6V6 pentodes in the deluxe for example). In the 60‚Äôs there was the Rangemaster Treble Booster: we‚Äôre talking Clapton (Bluesbreakers), Tony Iommi (Sabbath), Brian May (Queen), Ritchie Blackmore (Deep Purple). It‚Äôs just a single knob box, they make them in stomp box form now for foot switching with a single knob and single switch, it‚Äôs germanium transistor based which makes it inherently edgy, it has a simple tone section, I think it‚Äôs a high-pass filter and then the germanium transistor gain stage. Dallas Rangemaster Treble Boost:  There was also the Fuzzface: Hendrix, Gilmour, Allman, Townshend, Harrison, etc. I‚Äôve never actually used one of these, I do have a plain-wrap rangemaster (homemade). The Fuzzface is  obviously  more complex (haha), it‚Äôs got two knobs! ‚Ä¶ and two germanium transistors! this leads me to guess that means it has an additional gain stage that drives into it‚Äôs own overdriven section (another serial gain-stage), this would mean the fuzzface is overdriving it‚Äôs second germanium transistor with the first germanium transistor. The second knob would control the output volume after the overdriven ‚Äúfuzz‚Äù stage (gain make-up to adjust the effected volume relative to it being bypassed ), of course, if you crank up that volume control it could also still overdrive the amplifiers preamp stage, just like the treble booster does, and all this extra gain would overdrive the output section of the amp even more. Now we‚Äôre up to 3 separate serial inline gain stages being overdriven, one germanium transistor, one preamp tube, and two output tubes. Arbiter Fuzzface (later Dallas-Arbiter):  Surely three stages of overdrive is enough! No! of course not! We‚Äôre guitarists! We could always put the rangemaster before the fuzz face and overdrive the input of the fuzzface. There are also other things that could be used to boost the signal into the amplifier input, another oldie but goodie was the gain stage in an old echoplex; this was the original delay unit, it was actually a loop of analogue tape with separate record and playback heads. Andy Summers (The Police) used two for his classic chorus sound, Early on, Eddie Van Halen used one for straight delay. But you could also just use the gain stage in the unit as a booster. It‚Äôs just a nice clean boost, no treble boost, just clean gain. There are booster pedals based on this circuit as well now. EP Booster:  You can use one to overdrive other gain stages, or just as a clean volume boost  after  other gain stages, maybe just for a little more volume for solos, it‚Äôll drive the amp input stage a little more as well (or a lot, if wanted). These are all a little older style overdrives and examples of how the whole manipulation of gain-stages got started decades ago by early electric guitar players. Basically the technology behind every one of these examples is that we are boosting our very, very quiet guitar output, amplifying it to the point where the next amplification stage can‚Äôt really handle the input without distorting the signal. It could be tube gain stages, germanium transistors, some kind of field effect transistors (FETs), a MOSFET or JFET, or an IC ‚ÄúIntegrated Circuit, a ‚Äúchip amp‚Äù (or opamp‚Äî‚Äùoperational amplifier‚Äù), which are monolithic amplifier designs that are non-discrete and contain all the resistors, capacitors, and transistors in a single encapsulated chip, rather than being assembled with ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù  separate  components assembled into a gain stage. In pedals we also get clipping from amplifying the signal into clipping diodes of various types, both silicon diodes and germanium diodes. What is a diode? A diode is like a rectifier tube (a rectifier tube  is  a diode) ‚Ä¶ a transistor  is  a triode ‚Ä¶ basically a rectifier tube is just missing a control grid that would allow it to be an amplifier stage. Diodes and triodes have operational limits, when the signal exceeds those limits, it distorts. All these gain stages operate on DC voltage (direct current), there are DC ‚Äúrails‚Äù that are the voltage limits that these components operate at, those voltage rails ‚Äúlimit‚Äù the amount our guitar signal can swing (all music is a form of AC voltage‚Äîalternating current). We could graph these AC voltages around our zero voltage point (mid-point between rails‚Äîit‚Äôs not actually 0, it‚Äôs all relative), the stronger the signal, the larger the swinging waveform becomes. When it‚Äôs big enough it will run into those voltage limits in the gain-stage (transistor or tube) it won‚Äôt get any bigger, the waveform peaks will begin to be clipped off (‚Äúclipping‚Äù), this squares the peaks of the AC waveform. Eventually a sine wave will be transformed into a square wave when enough of the peak is clipped off. Square vs. Sine vs. Triangle Waveforms:  So the green waveform starts to look more and more like the red waveform the more it overdrives a gain-stage, as discussed above, we can do this multiple times in serial. Let‚Äôs jump to a more modern overdrive pedal now, I‚Äôm not actually an expert on the different types of classic OD pedals, I was a rack guy in the late 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs, although I had a couple different pedals before I switched to a rack tube preamp, I‚Äôm actually switching back currently, and you can integrate both as well. Here‚Äôs a great video on the history & types of boost, overdrive and distortion with Josh Scott of JHS pedals; their timeline explanation is better than mine when it comes to pedal chronology.  One of the most well known, and most used OD pedals of all time is the Ibanez Tube Screamer, or a newer remake/flavor of the tube screamer circuit. It‚Äôs designed around op-amps (operational amplifier ‚Äúop-amp‚Äù), the specific op-amp varies by model, but the most sought out versions are generally agreed to have the JRC4558D chip (most guitarists call it a chip instead of op-amp, but technically, it‚Äôs an op-amp), I believe it‚Äôs a soft-clipping (the clipping diode is in a feedback loop). Probably the best reference guitarist to point out who used a tube screamer is Stevie Ray Vaughn, but he also used a Fuzzface.  Ibanez Tube Screamer History The photo above is from the Analogman website, he‚Äôs got a lot of historical info on there, great stuff. If you‚Äôve never bought an OD pedal before, especially if you have a Fender style amp, a tube screamer is a great starting point, a lot of guys who maybe don‚Äôt use the tube screamer sound as their main OD sound may still have one on their boards just to have it as a flavor when they want it. Now with a TS style box we‚Äôve added another knob again, Gain/Tone/Volume(make-up Gain). Basically any OD pedal after a straight boost pedal is going to have a volume/make-up gain knob; it‚Äôs what allows you to turn the distorted volume down so that your overdrive sound isn‚Äôt twice as loud as your clean sound. Just because we now have a pedal with three knobs that doesn‚Äôt mean we throw away the one knob style booster pedals, usually you put it in front of your OD pedal so you can add a bit more boost going into the OD, this way you can have two different levels of overdrive on top of your clean sound, you can kick in the booster for just that little bit more saturation when you need to kick it up a notch halfway through your solo. It could be a clean boost like the EP Booster, or a Treble Boost like the Rangemaster, or both, you may not always want that trebly/edgy germanium sound (when you hear it you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about, it‚Äôs not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea). This combo is so popular that a lot of new OD pedals incorporate a boost into a single pedal. There‚Äôs even a TS with a built in boost now:  Another classic from roughly the same era as the Tube Screamer (actually, a little later) is  Boss‚Äôs Blues Driver:  Same basic knob selection as a Tube Screamer, but it doesn‚Äôt have the bass frequencies cut-off like a TS. Some known players of the Blues Driver: John Mayer, Billie Joe Armstrong, Kevin Parker, Tom Morello, Robert Smith, Prince It‚Äôs popular enough that some boutique companies have made variations on the basic circuit as well: JHS Angry Driver:  The Tube Screamer is a bit more midrange focused, it works well with a classic Fender ‚Äúsmiley face‚Äù clean tone (Bass/Treble heavy with a scooped mid), I think the BD has a bit more bottom end, but I‚Äôve never straight up A/B‚Äôd them. You can get a poorman‚Äôs Dumble Style overdrive sound out of the BD with the use of a combo of EQ and boost before the Blues Driver. There are some basic OD pedal types out there:  Tube Screamers, Blues Driver/FulltoneOCD, KLON‚Äôs and Clone‚Äôs of Klon‚Äôs (germanium based I think), Dumble style pedals (although Howard Dumble is famous for building tube amps, not pedals), Rat style pedals, Marshall Guv‚Äônor types. Some of the above like the Klon, and I think the Gov‚Äônor are a hard clipping type, the amplifier device is overdriving diodes that are directly in the signal path, as opposed to them being in a feedback loop. That earlier video explains it better than I do. This second video coming up covers some of the classic OD pedal types and how they sound going into different amps. All of this is just a jumping off point though, when you‚Äôre plugged in with your own guitar in your hands, the way things respond to your own style of playing can change all your expectations. An absolutely terrific source of info on effects pedals is the YouTube channel ‚ÄúThat Pedal Show‚Äù, everything is well recorded, not just a laptop or phone placed to see the player, good mics, with good amps (multiple types: Fender, Marshall, Vox), and good microphone technique. That Pedal Show ‚Äì 5 Modern Classic OD Pedals into 3 Classic Amps:  There are things about the boutique pedal market that you need to watch out for. The basic circuits have been copied, and passed around, and tweaked by changing small component values (which can make a quite noticeable difference ‚Ä¶ sometimes). Some originals have become ridiculously expensive, some copies with the tiniest of changes get sold as some esoteric ‚Äúmagic‚Äù for ridiculous prices. There‚Äôs a lot of wackiness going on in the boutique pedal market, there‚Äôs a great first hand experience story by a guy named Clay Jenkins that‚Äôs a great read about how the hype gets out of control.

Ibanez Series S,What material is a Fender guitar made of?,"Alder is the traditional Strat wood. While they were Ash in '54, they switched a few years later all all the famous Strat players, from Buddy to EC to Jimi used Alder Strats. While Alder was still used, Northern Ash (Hard Ash) was the Fender wood of choice in the mid-'70's. Very heavy and very bright. Using heavy woods just a side-effect of '70's cost cutting but it was a consumer preference because of a misbelief that heavier bodies meant more sustain....Ibanez used Northern Ash as well for the Musician Series and Bob Weir model and others (Gibson used heavy all maple bodies). So a '70's Strat was usually Northern Ash (so called because its from the denser top of the trunk) or Alder. If its Lighter and solid in color, its Alder. Tonal descriptions are generalities and are most noticed in side by side comparisons but they ALL sound like Strats at the end of the day. '57 Fender AVRI are usually Alder, but they made have used Ash for the Sunburst at times. Swamp Ash (Southern Ash) used the '50's Ash and is the choice of boutique Builders and Tele fans. It's the lightest (and often most resonant) with scooped mids, tight punchy bottom and crisp, snappy top end. Northern Ash is much, much heavier. Besides its use in the '70's it's more common as Swamp Ash becomes harder to get (companies like G&L are now hoarding ite and Fender only specs it on certain CS models), Northern Ash is used more. Much brighter top end, almost piercing, less balanced. Alder can very in weight, from slightly heavier than Swamp Ash to almost as heavy as the heavy Northern Ash. It's more even across the tonal spectrum, almost rounded. Hood midrange, big but loose and unfocused low end and tpp end the rolls off early. Thicker sounding but less clarity and snap versus Ash. Korina is used on some Fender guitars and I have owned a Tele that had a Korina body and I liked it very much. It is always a very distinctive look and easily recognizable wood and generally more associated with Gibson than Fender. Now on some of the MIM Fenders Poplar was used for the painted body guitars because it is a great choice if you have a painted finish instead of a natural finish. One of the less common body woods used was Basswood. I have owned a few of these and they were fine guitars and typically you could find Basswood used on the MIJ Fenders. The one thing I will touch on is aftermarket bodies you can get and these are authorized bodies by Fender, so you can get one of these and Fender will recognize it as a Fender body. Here are the wood choices for these. BODY WOODS Alder: Alder is used predominantly for bodies because it is readily available, light weight and has a full even tone. Alder's natural color is light reddish tan with little or no distinct grain lines. Its closed grain makes the wood easy to work with and finish. Alder has been one of the main woods for Fender bodies since the beginning. It was primarily used for solid color paints but was also used with three tone Sunburst or Tobacco burst finishes. Because of its proven tonal characteristics and lower price, Alder is one of our most popular woods. Ash: We offer two different types of Ash, Northern Hard Ash and Southern Soft, or Swamp Ash. Northern Hard Ash: This is a very hard and heavy wood. A body will weigh 6 lbs. and up. With its density, the tone is very bright. Its color is tan, but also tends to have heart wood of pink to brown tints. The grain is open, very much like Oak. This wood is also very difficult to finish because of it's open grain. Swamp Ash or Southern Soft is a prized wood for many reasons. This is the wood many 50's and 60's Fenders were made of. It is easily distinguishable from Northern Ash by weight and in it's lighter appearance. The weight of this wood varies greatly, but the lighter bodies are the most sought after, anywhere between 3 1/2 to 5 pounds per body. This wood sings, offering an even balance across the entire spectrum of brightness and warmth. The grain is open and also difficult to finish but well worth the trouble, a beautiful choice for clear finishes. Swamp Ash is our most popular wood. Basswood:  This is very light in weight, bodies usually weigh four pounds or less. The color is white, but often has green mineral streaks throughout. This is a closed-grain wood, but quite soft, it can absorb a lot of finish. This is not a durable wood and not used for clear finishes, but because of it's dark warm tone is still a fine selection. Mahogany:  Honduran Mahogany, is the same wood used in many fine solid and hollow body guitars. This is an excellent wood with good musical properties, covering the gamut from Blues to Jazz, the tone is warm full and sweet with good sustain. Mahogany varies in body weight averaging 5 lbs. or more for a solid body. The grain is open yet easy to fill. The wood varies in appearance from very plain to a beautiful array of ribbons, a good wood for clear finishes. Maple: There are two types of Maple which we use, Northern Hard (Hard Rock Maple) and Western Soft (Big leaf Maple). Hard Maple is the same wood used for necks. It is very dense, and weighs quite a bit. The grain is closed and easy to finish. The sound of Maple is very bright with a lot of bite. It looks good in any style finish. Western Soft Maple is another wood like Alder that grows in and around in Washington State. It is usually much lighter and softer than Hard Maple, but is a little more towards reddish brown in color. Its sound is characterized by good bite and attack, bright, but not brittle like hard Maple. Our Fiddle back and quilted bodies are western Big leaf Maple. Walnut: Walnut is not quite as heavy as Maple, It has a similar sound though not as bright. Walnut is very beautiful with open grain. Oil finishes can look wonderfully rich on this wood when applied properly. Koa:  This very beautiful wood indigenous to Hawaii. Weight varies somewhat from medium to heavy, a good wood for basses and in combination with other woods to create hollow body guitars. Koa has a warm sound similar to mahogany, but a little brighter. Like Walnut, this wood may be oiled or sprayed clear either way this wood is gorgeous. Zebrawood:  This wood is very heavy with a very distinctive look, open grained with light and dark brown stripes it is becoming more and more common in the bass and guitar world. Its weight and sound are similar to Walnut depending on the application. It is difficult to find in thick pieces, but it is more commonly available for laminated bodies where it excels. This wood may be oiled or sprayed clear, either way this wood is also very beautiful. Rosewood:  This wood is our heaviest with bodies weighing in at over six pounds plus. We've used several different species, depending on availability, but our primary choice is Indian Rosewood. The sound is much warmer than Maple, the high end seem to lack a bit only because of the oily nature of the wood. Finishes are difficult to apply because of its oil content I know I reference the tonal qualities of the different woods but in truth that is the Fender reasoning and not mine. For electric guitars wood choice has very little to do with sound. 99% of the sound on an electric is determined by the pickup choice and not what wood it is made of. I will say that wood choice does make a difference for acoustic guitars but not as much as many say. I won‚Äôt get into acoustic guitars though.",https://www.quora.com/What-material-is-a-Fender-guitar-made-of,"Thus far, nobody has been able to prove in any way that the type of wood in a solid body electric guitar influences the tone.",,,,
Ibanez Series S,What is a good jazz guitar?,"Opinions. Always with the opinions. Ok, you bet. Depending on your approach, I think in a solid body I would start with the venerable granddaddy of all, the fender stratocaster. Possibly a custom telecaster. And if my head were inclined to be a bit more modern, the Ibanez S-series are incredibly versatile and comfortable to play. On the other side of the street in hollowbody land, I guess you have to include the 335 Gibson by default, but id look for one made prior to the current CEOs arrival. Apparently he brought some kind of weird amnesia with him and now nobody can remember how to build a good guitar. The Chibsons are being built better. If you gotta have a new one get an Epiphone, far better fit and consistent quality. With the money you save you can buy a second one and get some nice Duncan pickups to finish it up. Thats actually a really good idea come to think of it. But, though it's odd for me to go all vintage headed, dont buy a hollowbody without playing several varieties of Gretch guitars. Ive have a warm spot for em, they just, I dont know, have a vibe about them. The Chet Atkins model is a nice target, thats the one that hooked me, the Bigsby trem on board and wow. Just nifty. Sooo smooth its creepy. If you're loaded daddy Warbucks style you MIGHT be able to get ahold of a Penguin. Maybe. Kinda doubt it. But what a dream piece, thatd be like a Stradivarius violin, only less common. If you pull it off buy the original batmobile to drive to gigs. And a cowel/cape/bat utility belt. And now to my personal pick, the guitar that would be my hands down choice, no competition, nothing to talk about, im looking for the right one as we speak and WILL have one soon. Should have bought new on release when I could use my employee discount at strings and things‚Ä¶the original version of the wonder known as the Parker Fly. Yea, yea, I can hear the groans and jeers from the peanut gallery, and to them I say‚Ä¶have a seat ladies, you know not of what you speak. Really, the haters, every one ive spoken with ever, have never actually held one even once. And had no knowledge of the technology that makes them unique. Firstly, its the ONLY advanced innovation guitar encountered since I started playing. Everyting about it is an upgrade, all others are spins on the old. The electronics are edgy but still intuitive for players. The pickups are fine, but id swap em for most likely a Duncan JB/Jazz combo, because DUNCAN. Seymour knows tone, period. Having the piezos mounted on the trem for acoustic sounds, and on board blending with the humbuckers(or split bucker for single coil) provide flexibility that is unmatched without extensive customization anywhere else. Add one of Duncan's pickup ring preamps for even more sonic phenomenon, but I just had that thought, it will take a minute to figure just how, or even if worth doing. (Having on board clean boost option makes it so I think) Finally the ridiculously low weight of carbon fiber over tone wood and absolute perfect balance, and a neck that literally feels like playing air guitar, and youve got the ultimate jazz guitar. And A list studio players guitar. And I dont care im playin it any style guitar. Dammit, ive given myself the fever writing about it. Wanna buy a nice SG? Only played by a little old lady in church on Sunday, I swear! Seriously, a Parker and a Mesa Lonestar or Roland jazz 120 depending on taste(BOTH) would be, in my humble opinion, impossible to beat at this time. Theres just nothing that can do so much so well anywhere else. Hope that helps‚Ä¶",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-jazz-guitar,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Which guitarists worked the whammy bar the best?,"Unbelievably, there are two guys omitted from all these answers. Two of the players who practically INVENTED the use of a whammy in Rock/Rock-a-Billy! We all have music choices, but can tell when someone is great, regardless of the music style. ALL the guys mentions are phenomenal! SV . . . I just watched all 9 minutes of the video. He‚Äôs no doubt an incredible player. But to me, that was one boring 9 minutes. The music piece wasn‚Äôt boring. It‚Äôs very cool. And he‚Äôs great! Don‚Äôt get me wrong. But it‚Äôs all just show off flash. When he held the guitar buy the vibe bar, (without going out of tune? - that is no biggie!) the guitar weighs about 8 pounds. When he does a big pull back on the bar that‚Äôs a LOT more than the weight of the guitar. Plus, that‚Äôs no off the shelf Ibanez. It‚Äôs custom made for him to handle huge whammy bends. JS . . .

BUT, he‚Äôs GREAT! However, someone mentioned JB not using the bar a lot, but is very good when he does. Um, again, IMHO, JB WAY over uses the vibe bar. To me, he uses it SO MUCH, I think it‚Äôs  distracting , and takes away from the piece he‚Äôs playing. Way over used. Those little ‚Äúflicks‚Äù he does are really cool!  But not all the time. Again, don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love the guy. And his 4 pc band is amazing. (Yeah, that girl can play!) And to make it clear, I owe JB a world of thanks. He taught me how to set up a vibe bar the correct way!!!!! (Not him personally. But interviews and articles by his tech, etc.) Once I got my main ‚Äúgo to‚Äù Strat set up like he does his, POW! But that‚Äôs another topic. If you don‚Äôt know his secret, and can‚Äôt find it, let me know. All the other guys mentioned . . . GREAT PLAYERS! But let‚Äôs roll back the clock. Whammies of some kind or other have been around since 1948. (Bigsby) And Fender‚Äôs whammy is totally different, but IMO the best. At least for my style of playing.

Presidential Election,Did anyone successfully call the 2016 presidential election?,"I did. January 2016. I must admit, I questioned my wisdom several times after that date. Trump did everything possible to make me wrong. Kookiest campaign I‚Äôve ever seen. How did I know he‚Äôd win? I grew up blue collar, working class, union in Detroit, MI. When I say union, I mean union. If my dad found non-union stuff in our house, he‚Äôd throw it out. If you are from a union family in the 50‚Äôs, 60‚Äôs or 70‚Äôs, you know what I mean. There is God, Family and the Union. Sometimes, it‚Äôs not necessarily in that order. This past January, I was having dinner with my mom (who‚Äôs on the back half of her 70‚Äôs and has most definitely never voted for a Republican in her life). She told me she thought she ‚Äúmight vote for Trump‚Äù. To be honest, I have not even asked her who she actually ended up voted for. That was it, I knew he‚Äôd win and I told several people that. I know polling can be tricky and the ‚ÄúNate Silvers‚Äù of the world spin a lot of data that gets polling headlines, but if you‚Äôre a Democrat, you can‚Äôt lose my mom‚Äôs vote.

Presidential Election,How accurate were Nate Silver's predictions for the 2012 Presidential election?,"Whether Nate Silver picked who won the election in a given state isn't the right measure to determine how well he did. Getting lucky and shading Florida blue at the last moment was a 50/50 guess and he got lucky.   Science is about the error bars.   Nate Silver provided his expectation and his uncertainty for each of the results.  If you compute [*]
  X = ( \text{E} - \text{O})/\sigma
where E is the expected margin of victory of Obama in a given state, O is the result of the election (observed result) and  \sigma  is the uncertainty in the prediction, then the distribution of X for the 50 states, the district of Columbia, the 3 NE congressional districts and the 2 ME congressional districts should fill out a normal distribution centered at 0 with a variance of 1. The primary criticism from others doing the same type of analysis as Nate Silver was that he was overstating how close the election was.  That is, he was making it out to be more of a horse race, when others were saying it was going to be  a clear victory for Obama.  It ended up being a clear victory for Obama so we should delve into the predictions versus the results to see if we notice any anomalies. What I found using the 50 states and the District of Columbia (I can't find the congressional district election results) is that Nate Silver favored  Romney  by 0.083 standard deviations and had a standard deviation a of 0.96, just a bit smaller than a normal distribution.  If you compute the higher moments, the skewness and kurtosis, you find that the skewness is small and the kurtosis indicates that the distribution is a bit wider than a normal distribution. More or less, this seems to be a resounding success of Nate Silver's model and his incorporation of expert knowledge into the polls.  In particular, there had been criticism that his expert knowledge model inflated errors and gave Obama a smaller lead than what he had.  There doesn't seem to be any basis for these complaints.  There was minuscule slight preference for Romney that is most likely attributable to having a finite sample size of 51 predictions.  In particular, this analysis, weighs all states the same, including ones where there was not extensive polling information in the lead up to the election because they weren't swing states, so it's really impressive to hit these on the nose. Silver's biggest misses were West Virginia where Silver predicted a 16.2% victory for Romney and it ended up being 26.8%; however, he attributed a 4.8% uncertainty to this prediction, which results in a X =2.21 (2.21 standard deviations off) anomaly which occurs about once in time in 50 (i.e. you'd expect such a miss).  His other miss was Hawaii where he predicted a 33.8% victory for Obama and it ended up being 42.8% with an uncertainty of 3.9%, result in a X= 2.31 (2.31 standard deviations off) anomaly.   Here is the distribution of X
  Nothing particularly noteworthy about it, there are two 2+sigma deviations which is what you'd expect in a sample of 51. Here is a comparison of what was expected (green) compared to what was actually observed (blue)
  So Nate Silver did a great job in aggregate with the polls and it looks like a fairly Gaussian (normal) distribution. The signature of trying to make the race closer than what it seems is inflating the error bars in states that matter.   If Obama had a 1.5% lead in a state with a large number of electoral votes and the real uncertainty was 0.25% and you state it at 1.0%, you go from predicting a clear, but close win for Obama to having it be a toss up (the difference between a 6 sigma fluctuation and a 1.5 sigma fluctuation).   Most of these states don't matter, there isn't much polling in them because they're predetermined. Obviously importance is a subjective definition, so I created an ""importance"" weight which is defined as
  I = \frac{N_{\text{EV}}}{5 + \left( \Delta/\sigma\right)^2}
where  N_{\text{EV}}  is the number of electoral votes in a state,   \Delta  is how far the prediction is apart, and  \sigma  is the error in the estimate.  The 5 simply regulates the expression if the polls are tied (as they were in Florida.  The most important states were
FL (5.8), NC (2.8), OH (2.7), VA (2.3), PA (2.0), which more or less identifies the battleground states. Now doing a weighted average of the 50 states plus DC, the average X is now 0.11 in favor of Romney, which is very close to the 0.08 for the aggregate predictions.  The primary difference arrises in the standard deviation of the importance weighted predictions, this goes to being 0.49 from 0.96.  This is a dramatic drop and does partially validate the Princeton Election Consortium's claim that Silver was over-estimating the errors.  If we make the same histogram as above, but now weight each by the importance, the result is in blue below
  which is noticeably more peaked than a normal distribution in green. The difference is because the 8 most important states all finished within the margin of error, with both FL and NC at less than 0.25. [*] This is assuming that the distribution is quasi-Gaussian, he doesn't provide his likelihood function, so this is about as well as you can do and won't make too much of a difference unless his distributions are really perverse, which would be surprising.",https://www.quora.com/How-accurate-were-Nate-Silvers-predictions-for-the-2012-Presidential-election,"This analysis is significantly complicated by the fact that Silver's state-by-state predictions were not intended to be independent of each other. For example, a significant source of uncertainty was total turnout. If total turnout was low, it was expected to swing several states together to Romney. (I am taking word-of-mouth from people I trust reasonably well that this actually was part of Silver's model. In fact, they told me this themselves when I mistakenly assumed independence in a Facebook post.) Since the individual probabilities are dependent but Silver did not publish his entire joint probability distribution, it is quite difficult to assess the extent to which we should consider his predictions biased. For example, the Central Limit Theorem cited to  Ghalib Suleiman  requires independent trials.",Analyzed like a true particle physicist!  Thanks! So what was the statistical significance of his prediction of an Obama win?,"Doing science is the only way to evaluate other people's science. Hearing people say ""he got 50 out of 50"" was getting frustrating.","It's a different question, but given his predictions for 2008, I'm curious what the probability is that he would have gotten 49/50 correct.  Several of those states are easy to call, but if they were all marginal it would be very unlikely for him to get 49/50.  I couldn't find the numbers for 2008 in my 5 min of looking.","Are you assuming that E is normal? If so, is this fair?"

Do you know that World of Warcraft runs quite nicely on Ubuntu ? The process is quite simple - just copy the installed World of Warcraft directory from windows to your linux system ( for me it was a copy from the windows partition to linux ) and then run it (requires wine to be installed first !). Most online resources talk about installing from the CD which is just not required.
 $ wine Wow.exe -opengl  4. Install Tweak Tool
This is quite good as Ubuntu hides a lot of stuff that you are used to seeing. This makes it easy to get back those settings - like showing the mounted volumes on the desktop etc. 5.

Presidential Election,What is the best way to get unbiased coverage of the 2020 presidential election?,"Sure, you can get lots of them. I‚Äôd suggest two in particular. First.  The easiest way to do so is to read statistical projections from foreign (non-US) media. They have no axe to grind, but they obviously have an interest in who will win the election that determines the leader of the world‚Äôs largest economy and last remaining super power. And they can crunch the numbers just as well as anyone else. I prefer  The Economist  (a British newspaper) or the  Financial Times  (ditto), both of which provide sensible non-critical analysis of the probabilities. Economist:  Forecasting the US 2020 elections Financial Times:  Biden vs Trump: US presidential election poll tracker Second.  The next easiest way: check the betting websites. Betting websites don‚Äôt care about politics, they only care about money. Now, their odds are going to be skewed slightly because they vary according to betting trends as well as probabilities, but it is always going to be fairly close to the line. And it is going to be entirely apolitical.

‚Äúcheck the betting websites‚Äù
 I actually made this point a while back and was immediately refuted with a ‚Äò they‚Äôre controlled by the Democrats ‚Äô comment. I‚Äôm pretty sure Paddy Power doesn‚Äôt have a hotline to Biden‚Ä¶","The betting websites picked Hillary Clinton in 2016. I know because I have some acquaintances who made a killing putting money on Trump. When it comes to US presidential elections, the betting sites don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.","http://realclearpolitics.com  is the place to go. They list all the major polls, then do an average of those polls. Rasmussen skews right and always makes Trump look better than the other polls. Quinipiac has no axe to grind. The other polls just use whatever methods they use and publish what they get. On the average of all polls, Biden now is leading Trump by 7.2 points. That will change from day to day. Some people say, ‚ÄúWell, the polls sure were off for the Trump v. Hillary contest.‚Äù Not really. The polls going into election day had Hillary ahead by 3 points and that was within ‚Äúthe margin of error.‚Äù Meaning: either side coud win. Hillary actually won the popular vote by over three million votes. Trump won the electoral college on the basis of a combined 80,000 votes among three states, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In other words, the average of all the polls on election day was ‚Äúin the ballpark.‚Äù","I don‚Äôt bet so the odds on the betting websites make little sense to me. For example, under Bet365 (the leftmost column in your link) it has: Biden: 20/29 Trump: 23/20 What does that mean? What are the numbers beside Harris, Pence, and (mysteriously) Clinton all about? Harris has a 45, Pence a 110?","I'm glad to help. Trump by a decisive margin. Biden‚Äôs so-called edge for the past year was mostly created by manipulating the polling samples, that is, adding in lots of Democrats and reducing the percentage of Republicans. I suspect they were almost even. But now we have Biden‚Äôs growing inability to be a candidate. Further, we have the weird Dem strategy of celebrating looting and violence. Plus 3 for each of these and you have a 6-point spread. It seems to me just like four years ago but even worse now for the Democrats."
Tricking,What is the best Android tip or trick you know?,"These are the common, yet best I know:
 Always you can root and install custom ROMs and customize. You can optimize your phone on rooting (Of course you tend to lose your warranty) You can remotely delete your phone's data when you lose it. You can side load apps out of play store. Don't get tied up to it. Know the difference and how to hard and soft reset. You can over-clock and under-clock your phone depending on performance and battery usage (needs root access) In latest versions, you can restrict or disable mobile data access for apps and you can un-install default apps. Widgets and animations may slow down your phone's performance. So try maintaining it like a PC. Explore developer options. There are hell a lot of secret codes to check your phone's stats and opens a new world to you. (The one I well know is *#*#7780#*#*,  used for resetting your phone to factory state-Only deletes application data and applications). For less aggressive call screening, you can also create canned messages in the phone or call settings on your handset so you can swipe up on the screen when your phone rings and quickly send a text message letting the caller know you‚Äôre busy. (HAVEN'T TRIED THOUGH)
 You can always create a backup password Allow mock location option (Haven't tried this too). You can destroy an app when you leave it. It is available in developer options. Face unlock can be hacked by using a hard copy of your photograph. (Even soft copy I think) Unlock your phone with voice command. Needs a lot of improvement though. Last but not the least.

Sometimes you can get things done by just earning this one quality. Respect . I'll tell you why. Think of all the people in your life whom you respect from the bottom of your heart. I think you can count the number in fingers. But you would do anything for these people because you respect them and you mean it. Also deep down, you know that these people deserve all these because you know they are worth it. For example, That one professor in college, who is such a gem. That one senior guy/girl who is just incredible. You take them as your inspiration. That one friend. Deep down, you know they are the ones worth listening to. You understand what I'm trying to say right? Yeah, be the person who can earn that  level  of respect. If you're being that kind of person for someone, they would do anything for you.

Tricking,What are some tricks used by waiters that most people never notice?,"The ‚ÄúSullivan Nod‚Äù named for Jim Sullivan a restaurant consultant that dominated in the 90‚Äôs: While a waiter is describing something to you, they will slightly nod there head yes if they want you to order it. ‚ÄúThis great piece of body language can increase incremental sales as much as 60%. Salespeople should smile and slowly nod their head up and down as they suggest an item to a customer. You‚Äôll be blown away by the fact that over 60% of the time the customer nods right back with you and takes your suggestion! For instance: Customer: I‚Äôd like a vodka/tonic please.
 Server: Would you like to try Stolichnaya (nod) or Absolut (nod) in that, sir?
 Customer: (mesmerized) Sure. Put em both in there!‚Äù If you ask for a request that's outside of possibility they will repeat back your request nodding no slightly to detour you. This was not a Sullivan trick. 2. Over pouring: When you order a bottle of wine (especially in a banquet or corporate party setting) the servers will lush you up and pour to the top of the glass. More bottle sales means higher check average and both usually mean more gratuity. Sometimes you are lucky if all the bottles paid for even make it into the dining room. Count your empties if you can. 3. ‚ÄúThree in the pocket‚Äù: Your server that is paying for school by waiting tables at ‚Äútre chic‚Äù or any other single syllable restaurant du jour doesn‚Äôt have time to memorize all the possible wines and regions on most menus. The restaurant definitely didn‚Äôt let them taste them. The most likely cannot afford to do so themselves. Instead, they will make you order based on ego and what you like anyways. The first question goes something like ‚ÄúWhat kind of wine do usually enjoy?‚Äù This narrows it down and makes you feel special divulging your astute wine taste. They then navigate to the menu drawing your attention to that section (of which they really only know three of the 12) and give you the one you won‚Äôt pick (the cheap one) the one absurdly expensive (yup that one), then the one they want you to order (the one closer to absurd but just above the price you would have paid had you know anything about wine in the first place) 4. ‚ÄúDoubling Down‚Äù: Large parties are usually ‚Äúautograt‚Äù, meaning the restaurant has already added a service charge or gratuity to your check for parties with people more than x. If you‚Äôre tipsy, don‚Äôt pay attention, are using a corporate card and don‚Äôt care you are a target, when the bill arrives, the less obvious receipt copy will be on top. IF you are spending evil corps dollars, wtf do you care if they get one over on you ;)? Do it anyways. Most likely there is a table of 23 that goes out to eat once a decade fighting the ‚Äúautograt‚Äù. Do your part to even the odds of server survival. 5. Add ons: Nothing in life is free. Great servers make their own menu out of whats available. They are also vehemently hated by the Chef, but darlings to owners. Say there is this nifty free trade local organic gluten free shade grown chocolate torte. I know what  Aaliyana Hassan, Quoran  is thinking, ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt chocolate beans in Detroit!?‚Äù, or any other US city or state for that matter. This is not the point. The point is that thang is dry and your server knows it. Gelato aka Ice cream not on the menu, has no price, but your super server knows where to get some to top that baby off. Same goes for warm caramel sauces, croissants with salads, extra bacon, etc etc. Its a bonus if its not on the menu officially as there is no official price. This is how you end up paying $32 for a scallop Caesar. Both you and the server belong in hell in my book. The owner usually doesn‚Äôt take into account they are not coming back after the sticker shock. 6. Taking your child's order like a little man / woman. Yes, they will love the lobster and it comes with a cool shell souvenir. Do you know what goes great with that, a Shirley temple, chocolate milk shake etc etc and I‚Äôll keep them coming. Large parties with kids all at one end is money in the bank. 7. ‚ÄúThe low rider‚Äù: Anything of value and spectacle a table orders will be parade-ed the longest route that catches all the tables that haven‚Äôt yet ordered that course yet. Low fly by‚Äôs of flaming, sparkling sizzling whatever that buzz your tower are probably normal order amount + $15 padded.

Tricking,What psychological tricks do restaurants use?,"1)Sardar Pav Bhaji - Mumbai It is one of the famous Pav Bhaji restaurants in Mumbai. It is so busy over the weekends that you nearly have to spend around 45 mins in the queue to get yourself a table to sit and order your dish. Coming back to the question, after waiting for almost 50 mins in the queue, my friends and I were finally relieved to get a table. The hunger was at its peak and we were waiting for someone to come and take our order. The restaurant being busy, the waiters were moving everywhere, serving each table. Finally, we saw a waiter with bottled water in hand. He was simply putting the bottles on each table without asking. Soon after, there came another waiter serving ‚ÄòPapad‚Äô in plates. They will not really ask you but you need to answer them instantly as they come near your table. Mind you, their service is so fast that you have to tell them ‚ÄòNo‚Äô, within a split second, if you don‚Äôt want the bottled water/papad else at the end, you‚Äôll end up paying for the same. The trick here is simple, after waiting for almost 45‚Äì50 mins in queue, everyone is hungry and tired to actually analyse whats going around and by the time you realise, you already have a bottled water on your table and papad in your plates.. 2) CCD (Cafe Coffee Day) One fine day, my cousin and I were hanging around at Carter Road, Bandra when we planned to visit the CCD, which is in front of the beach, to treat ourselves with some refreshing coffee. We entered the cafe and were scanning the menu to check the options available. Soon, we were approached by a waiter to take our order. Here is how the conversation went: He : Mam, what would you like to order? Me : I would like a Crunchy Frappe and Devil‚Äôs Own. He : Okay, Mam would you like to have Vanilla Icecream or chocolate brownie in Crunchy Frappe? Me  ( thinking this is included in the drink ): How do you serve it? He : We will either add Vanilla icecream in the Frappe or we will blend chocolate brownie when we prepare it. Me ( being a chocolate lover I am ): I‚Äôll go for chocolate brownie. He : Mam, would you like to have vanilla icecream or chocolate icecream in Devil‚Äôs Own? Me  ( asking my cousin ): What will you have? My cousin:  Vanilla icecream. Me  ( to the waiter ): Vanilla icecream in Devil‚Äôs Own. He : Okay mam, I will repeat your order. One Crunchy Frappe with brownie and one Devil‚Äôs Own with vanilla icecream. Is that it? Me : Yeah, its perfect. He : Okay Mam, I will get your order. We got our drinks and enjoyed it completely. Soon, we asked for bill. And thats when we came to know we were fooled. The bill was Rs. 200 extra apart from the original cost of the drinks. We called out the waiter and asked about this. He : Mam, you had ordered chocolate brownie with Crunchy Frappe and Vanilla icecream with Devil‚Äôs Own. So, we have added 100 rs. for both of them. Me ( with an angry look ): You should‚Äôve informed us that its costs extra. If we‚Äôre coming here for the first time, how will we know if its included in the drink or not. He : But Mam, its chargeable. We can‚Äôt revert the bill. Me : I don‚Äôt know anything. I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for it because you didn‚Äôt inform us about it earlier. And then we talked to the manager, luckily we were exempted from paying it. But soon I realised, ‚Äò Be careful ‚Äô while placing order at any such outlets. If you don‚Äôt wanna pay extra, always tell them, I want the regular one. 3. McDonalds I went to McDonalds to get myself a McAloo Tikki meal. As I reached the counter to place my order, here‚Äôs the conversation that took place with the counter guy. He:  Namaste Mam, what would you like to order? Me : One McAloo Tikki Meal He : Mam, a Medium Meal or Large Meal? Me  ( recollecting that they have a small meal also ): You also have a regular meal right? He : Yes Mam Me : Yes, so I want a regular meal. I paid the bill and then I realised, how they might be fooling so many people who are unaware that they also have a Small/Regular meal and end up paying 50%+ extra for a Medium meal.. This is how the restaurants/outlets trick people who are unaware of the prices and the menu.",https://www.quora.com/What-psychological-tricks-do-restaurants-use,"It‚Äôs sad to see why people use such silly tricks to get money instead of giving a better customer experience. If they do like this, they have repeat value from the customers. In the long run, they lose customers for few bucks.","Restaurants earn primarily by these value additions. Starters in any restaurants can trump your whole meal cost. Toppings in McD, KFC etc. can cost 50‚Äì100% more. Everything ‚Äòextra‚Äô = 50% more cost. The reason is that they advertise 60/- pizza or 25/- aloo tikki. But once you are in they want the max gain. The technique is called ‚Äòfoot in the door‚Äô principle. Wanna go for a dinner date?How about asking for an ‚Äòinnocent‚Äô coffee!","Its so annoying, but it is also a very simple trick, you see. In Bhubaneswar, restaurants have begun to put mineral water bottles on tables. They charge for it if you open the bottle. That‚Äôs a good tactic considering most people do not carry their own bottles. And keeping one right on the table will entice people to drink it. Shopping malls too keep candy bars, hair clips, earrings etc near the billing counter to entice people. They are taking advantage of plain human psychology. Because most human beings are not mindful of their actions and operate on an impulse always.","I have a similar experience. We went for breakfast buffet at a popular chain in Virginia. While waiting to get seated, the manager came and asked us to grab the cups to get any drink. Since it was our first visit, we didn't suspect anything. Much to our surprise, the $13 per person cost turned out to be $16. They charged us freaking $3 extra for a watery coke much to our chagrin. My friend remarked that it should have been made clear that it is extra, to which they just shrugged their shoulders. I have no problem paying extra if I need something but only if I need something!",I'll tell you what I would do at CCD if they act like that with me. You have charged me 200 extra without informing. That seems to be your technique. Even I have a technique that I didn't inform you earlier. I don't pay anything at all whenever I experience such things. I leave. Call the police if required. There is a second method. Iron cuts iron. Use a lie against their trick. Say you asked for any extra charges with the waiter. The waiter said there is no extra charge. Hence I won't pay any extra amount. Ask them to prove me wrong. If they show any CCTV video. Involve the police and show them how they avoid the entire discussion of any hidden charges in the first place.

Presidential Election,Can the US hold a special presidential election?,"No, we cannot do that, under current law. There are three things that regulate the line of succession: the 25th Amendment to the US Constitution, Article II Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution, and the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. The relevant text of each: 25th Amendment (Section 1):  In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or resignation, the Vice President shall become President. Article II, Section 1, Clause 6:  In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. Note that the 25th Amendment clarifies the first part of II, 1, 6 by replacing ‚Äú‚Ä¶the Same shall devolve on the Vice President‚Ä¶‚Äù with ‚Äú‚Ä¶shall become President.‚Äù Traditionally, that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always happened, but the first time a president died in office, in 1841, there were two days of debate over whether or not the VP had actually become president, or was merely acting as president, before Congress said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the prez.‚Äù (The part of the original text about disability of a president is covered in other parts of the 25th, but that‚Äôs not relevant to your question). The part of Clause 6 that says ‚Äú‚Ä¶Congress may by Law provide for the case of‚Ä¶Death‚Ä¶both of the President and Vice President‚Ä¶‚Äù was done with the passage of the  Presidential Succession Act of 1947 . The pertinent parts of that Act read (and I am editing for brevity and clarity):  (1)  If, by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify, there is neither a President nor Vice President to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall, upon his resignation as Speaker and as Representative in Congress, act as President. (2)  The same rule shall apply in the case of the death, resignation, removal from office, or inability of an individual acting as President under this subsection. (b)  If, at the time when under subsection (a) of this section a Speaker is to begin the discharge of the powers and duties of the office of President, there is no Speaker, or the Speaker fails to qualify as Acting President, then the President pro tempore of the Senate shall, upon his resignation as President pro tempore and as Senator, act as President. (c)  An individual acting as President under subsection (a) or subsection (b) of this section shall continue to act until the expiration of the then current Presidential term ‚Ä¶. (d) (1)  If, by reason of death, resignation, removal from office, inability, or failure to qualify, there is no President pro tempore to act as President under subsection (b) of this section, then the officer of the United States who is highest on the following list, and who is not under disability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President shall act as President: Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, Secretary of the Interior, Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human Services, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary of Transportation, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Education, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Secretary of Homeland Security. (2)  An individual acting as President under this subsection shall continue so to do until the expiration of the then current Presidential term‚Ä¶. So, the law that covers what happens if there‚Äôs neither a POTUS or a VP specifically says that whoever ends up taking over acts as President til the end of the then-current term. There are some scenarios where someone could end up bumping someone else out, but there is no provision for calling a special election under any circumstances. Interestingly, though, prior to the 1947 Succession Act, the previous ones, which were passed in 1792 and 1886, DID state that, if such a vacancy happened prior to the start of the last year of a presidential term, there WOULD be a special election for a new POTUS and VP, who would then start a new, four-year term after being elected. That provision was obviously never enacted, and the current law from 1947 specifically and clearly states there will NOT be a special election. Interestingly, when this Act could potentially have been enacted in 1973 (after the resignation of Spiro Agnew as VP and the appointment of Gerald Ford to replace him), and in 1974 (when Ford became POTUS after Nixon‚Äôs resignation, and the appointment of Nelson Rockefeller as VP), the then-Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, was a Democrat (and Nixon, Ford, and Rockefeller were Republicans)‚Äîduring the times while the VP was vacant, and Speaker Albert was next in line, he publicly stated that, if he were to become Acting President, he would appoint a Republican Vice President and then resign, allowing that VP to become POTUS. Albert argued that the people had voted for a Republican president, and he didn‚Äôt want to have the presidency switch parties mid-term. The other two times where there was a VP vacancy since 1947‚Äîfrom the date the Act went into effect through January 20, 1949 (VP vacant due to the elevation of Harry Truman to the presidency when FDR died) and from November 22, 1963-January 20, 1965 (VP vacant due to the elevation of LBJ after JFK was assassinated), the Speaker was from the opposite party as the President in the first situation, and the same as the President in the second. (Note that the reason no new VP was appointed in those situations is because the procedure for appointing a replacement VP was also contained in the 25th Amendment, which was ratified in 1967‚Äîprior to that, it was left vacant until the next election).",https://www.quora.com/Can-the-US-hold-a-special-presidential-election,"Nice analysis. It‚Äôs interesting you pointed out the Nixon situation of the Democrat Speaker appointing a Republican VP and then resigning. Under the 1947 law, he would first have resign his seat in the House prior to becoming acting President. The other interesting twist, is whether an acting President can appoint the VP under the 25th Amendment or even officers to the cabinet. The problem would arise if the acting President was down the line of successsion a bit and he appoints a cabinet officer who is above him in the line of succession. Would the appointed cabinet officer automatically assume the role of acting President upon the Senate‚Äôs confirmation of his appointment? As you can imagine, the problem is constitutionally inherent in an acting President appointing a VP under the 25th Amendment. Does the appointed VP immediately assume the full Office of President? The newly appointed VP is constitutionally appointed to Office of VP and thereby necessarily has superior title to the acting President who appointed him. Here‚Äôs another strange twist. Can the VP as acting President (i.e. the President is disabled but not dead) appoint a VP under the 25th Amendment? Does that person become the acting VP only until the the President is no longer disabled? It seems to me like the whole current line of succession law is a little half baked and a ticking time bomb for a constitutional crisis.","Don, Thank you for your well thought response to the question of hierarchy for filling the POTUS position. With a scenario where it was clear the election and entire election process had been digitally modified shouldn't that election be nullified by rule of law?",,,
Presidential Election,Why did Prabowo Subianto lose the 2019 Indonesian presidential elections?,"Silent Majority! Hand's Down. When i think of Prabowo Subianto   the first thing that pops up in my mind as a politically conscious Indonesian, is this.  A bunch of nasty narcissistic Islamic hardliners trying desperately to overthrown the government using legal democratic action (the election) while piggybacking a real ‚ÄúPIG‚Äù.  Look at Prabowo's waistline, ugghhh  (not here to body shame but I just can't help it, please do not be offended) . It's because of this uncanny relationship with the Islamic hardliners that Prabowo lost the election in such a fashion. I was watching the news on my mobile phone when the numbers started to trickle in piece by piece and as the day progressed it was clear that President Joko Widodo had won by a very comfortable margin of between 8‚Äì10 percentage point. That can be classified as a landslide. The question is then why? How come the victory was so convincing? The answer was quite simple. It's because of people like me, times several millions. For those who track the movements and the behavior of Prabowo's supporters the way these people act is very distinct. They're very loud. They're very fanatical, to the degree of lunacy in my option. They're also very visible. They're presence both on the street and social media is just mind bogglingly disturbing. And yet despite all of that, survey after survey after survey put them way behind the incumbent. This reality, to those who are familiar with the science of elections must have indicated that there's a strong  Silent Majority  phenomenon occuring. It's a phenomenon where a potential voter kept his or her vote a secret until the last few days of even minutes before he or she cast their ballots. These type of voters usually don‚Äôt like the ruckus that came out of politics. They usually have their own way of deciphering the messages from each candidates and both logic and emotions played a significant part in the decision making process. These people mostly are not fanatical. They're pretty objective in looking at potential candidates, but there's an emotional silver lining that connects all of them. And that silver lining is this.  No matter what their ethnicity or religion is, for vast majority of them it boils down to whether they want Indonesia to be united under  Unity in Diversity  motto or whether they want Indonesia to be governed by a fanatical middle eastern inspired type of government. This is due to the fact from the very beginning Prabowo never really emphasize this very important aspect of the Indonesian psyche. Unity is a BIG theme on the minds of Indonesians. It's similar in psychic reaction to the rights for privacy in many European countries. When the unity of Indonesia is threatened by some type of force, even if that force is the people's own religion, then the very same people will reject the religion. It's kinda counter intuitive but that's how Indonesia works. Many foreigners especially in the west often mistaken Indonesia as ‚Äúanother Islamic‚Äù country. Presuming that because it's a Muslim majority country it will take the same path as other Muslim nations, in this case into Oblivion. Here in Indonesia, as much as we respect our religious leaders we also value our culture and our political freedom. So a cleric can throw his weight at Prabowo, like this piece of S*#t.  But even this very important endorsement failed due to a very simple fact. Prabowo is a DIVIDER. A big NO NO in Indonesia. He's part of the elite. He's part of Indonesia's past. He has a lot of baggage that needs sorting out. He's very tempramental. He's has a very dubious Islamic credentials. He's very leenient on corruption. But the most fatal thing about him is that he's not someone that projects UNITY. Indonesia has gone through a lot in the past 20 years. The country is back on the world scene and is moving forward. So naturally Indonesians are very united and optimistic. Combined that with an easy going and religious nature of the country, it creates a toxic mix of stubborn unity that can manifest both positively and negatively. Prabowo campaign against this backdrop and he failed, miserably. So the 2019 election is ultimately a referendum on unity. Unity often found not in some loud corner of Indonesia, or chanted by a bunch of Islamic thugs rehearsing a pillage as if they we're in power but it often prevails in the more humble rural settings. In the thousands of villages and islands far away from the center of politics. And as we all know, those villages and islands are where most of Indonesians lives. Just do the math, one or two million marching on the street of the capital chanting  Allah Akbar  or the tens of millions of others that prefer to keep their sanity intact while taking care of their daily lives and wait for the election day to exercise their right. Victory for the common sense I think.",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Prabowo-Subianto-lose-the-2019-Indonesian-presidential-elections,"I just visited the kawal pemilu site which outlined the regional results of each province. Despite Jokowi obviously won in total, it's rather alarming that in many regions Prabowo won spectacularly. It reflects how many of Indonesians who are actually supporting this divisive movement. As a minority (race and religion wise) in Indonesia, I think this fact is kind of scary‚Ä¶","It is reassuring that eventually reason did prevail. But 10% is not a landslide! Jokowi lost West Java/Banten and Sumatra badly‚Ä¶ Why? Religion! The debate was characterized as Pancasila against Islam. Unity in diversity against exclusion. The saddest is that Jokowi‚Äôs credential as a Muslim are still contested despite him choosing for VP a revered Muslim leader and Prabowo being obviously unable to read the Quran. So why? Because Prabowo supports Islam violent fanatics like FPI or the 212. Have the people adhered to such fanaticism? And forgotten about Pancasila? 10% is not a landslide because Prabowo had nothing to propose, beside dividing and rejecting others. He should not have made more than 30%! Jokowi‚Äôs win is comforting though, because after the DKI elections 2 years ago, it looked like religiosity had taken the ascendance above administration ability. With the recent flooding, Jakarta comes to reality that efficiency prevails on religious claims. Being a religious person is good if it is true, but it is not enough to run a government.","What I would be interested in: in your opinion, did the Ahok incident play a role as a call to action? Like: okay, this is enough, we cannot have our political decisions being taken away like this?","I was in Indonesia for a few weeks in 2014. A couple of months before the election. I saw that the situation was pretty heated. It's probably because I didn't go to Indonesia last year, but I got the feeling that the situation was not as tense this time around? For whatever reason, I never doubted Jokowi winning a re-election. What do you think? Was the atmosphere less tense?","This warms my heart, both as a Singaporean, and a student pursuing Political Science. This year‚Äôs election saw the WORST wipeout for Islamists in Indonesia‚Äôs history. May Indonesia buck the trends of the Islamic world, and progress together as 1 people!"
Presidential Election,"Did Facebook's ""fake news stories"" have a large influence on the outcome of the 2016 presidential election?","I first wrote about Facebook‚Äôs potential to swing elections in May of 2016. I had no idea how frighteningly accurate my prediction would be. While we still don‚Äôt have all the facts, it‚Äôs clear that Russian operatives gamed Facebook to swing the election to Trump. - Could Mark Zuckerberg decide the presidential election? The media‚Äôs been abuzz over a  report  this week claiming that Facebook staffers blocked conservative news stories from the site. Facebook denies the report. But it‚Äôs worth considering the growing role Facebook has in shaping public opinion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand whether it could use its enormous power to swing elections.  Around 200 million people in the US use Facebook every month, for an average of 50 minutes a day. It‚Äôs what  Parag Khanna calls a ‚Äústateless superpower‚Äù.  It‚Äôs where we get our news, share our personal opinions and political views. It‚Äôs also becoming a place where politicians are spending more time & money. The site‚Äôs rich demographic data lets politicians target prospective voters with highly personalized messages.  Facebook‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù, introduced in 2014, show up in a section to the right of the main newsfeed. The feature uses an algorithm to identify and promote topics in major media outlets that people are buzzing about. The topics are personalized to each user based on their ‚ÄúLikes‚Äù & location.  According to a  recent blog post , the company has a system involving both software formulas and humans to ensure stories displayed in ‚ÄúTrending Topics‚Äù aren‚Äôt biased. Justin Osofsky, Facebook VP of Global Operations (and my former McKinsey colleague), says ‚ÄúWe have a series of checks and balances in place to help surface the most important popular stories, regardless of where they fall on the ideological spectrum‚Ä¶ Facebook does not allow or advise our reviewers to discriminate against sources of any political origin.‚Äù  Does Facebook have a political agenda? Most companies do. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared to  publicly denounce Donald Trump  at last month‚Äôs annual F8 developer conference: ‚ÄúI hear fearful voices calling for building walls and distancing people they label as ‚Äòothers.‚Äô I hear them calling for blocking free expression, for slowing immigration, for reducing trade, and in some cases even for cutting access to the internet.‚Äù  Facebook employees understand the political power they wield. In  an internal poll  on what questions they want Zuckerberg to answer at the next Q&A, one question was ‚ÄúWhat responsibility does Facebook have to help prevent President Trump in 2017?‚Äù  Internal Facebook poll Facebook has no legal responsibility to provide an unbiased view of what‚Äôs happening on its network. Just as the New York Times has a First Amendment right to block or promote any content it wants, so can Facebook. It can decide which candidates to cover, and whether to show them in a positive or negative light. It‚Äôs not that different from how a newspaper editor decides which stories to run in large type on the front page. There‚Äôs one key difference, though. Facebook keeps its formulas secret, just as Google doesn‚Äôt release the algorithms that underlie its ubiquitous search engine. What these companies do with their algorithms can have profound effects.  In 2010  Facebook ran an experiment  with 61 million people to see how it could impact real-world voting behavior. According to one study, Facebook increased voter turnout by more than 340,000 people, simply by showing users a photo of someone they knew saying ‚ÄúI voted‚Äù. When I visited Facebook‚Äôs headquarters last summer, one theme I heard repeatedly was ‚ÄúFacebook tries to ship love‚Äù. They understand the power they have to shape users‚Äô emotions. It‚Äôs one of the keys to their success.  Nearly 80% of online American adults use Facebook. More people get their news from it than any other source. The company‚Äôs influence in politics & elections is unprecedented in the history of media. If it wanted to, it could almost certainly skew a national election toward one candidate. The same could be said for Google. I‚Äôm not saying this is happening now or is likely to happen in the future. But it should give us pause to consider: What if Facebook decided to remove any pro-Trump media coverage from its site? The damage it could do to a politician who relies so heavily on mass media would be ‚Äúyuge‚Äù. Companies have always used their power to sway elections, in the form of campaign contributions, ads, lobbying, bribery, etc. But no company has ever held so much influence while providing such minimal transparency into its operations.  I love Facebook. I was one of its original users back in 2004 when ‚Äúthefacebook‚Äù was available only to Harvard students. I use it every day. The idea of a tech company using its engineering savvy to destroy Trump may sound quite appealing to many people. But we should be cautious about where we‚Äôre heading. Is there a way to make companies like Google and Facebook accountable and transparent on how their software shapes public opinion? Or do we risk letting elections be decided by a handful of Silicon Valley CEOs?

Presidential Election,What do you think about COVID-19 to the American presidential election?,"The pandemic is sucking the oxygen out of the room as far as the Democratic campaign is going. Apparently Bernie Sanders has ended his campaign or at least paused it but that barely made the news. Joe Biden, the apparent winner, has vanished from public view (there‚Äôs a hashtag about this trending). Campaign rallies have been canceled. There‚Äôs no way for Biden to keep up his momentum. There‚Äôs a possibility that the national conventions will have to be canceled. The conventions usually act as a springboard for the campaigns into the election season. People are treating Trump as a war-time president meaning the nation is uniting behind him and his popularity is rising. People are also putting aside partisan differences. The governors of New York and California hate Trump but both have praised his response and thanked him for his help. These are two of the three hardest-hit states. Trump won the presidency on positions such as limiting immigration and bringing manufacturing back to the US. Those were controversial policies four years ago but now many countries have outright closed their borders, even ones within the European Union which is supposed to guarantee free travel for citizens of all member-nations. The manufacturing of pharmaceutics and medical supplies is being moved back to the US with Biden and Hillary Clinton complaining that it‚Äôs not being moved back fast enough. From September on, Trump will campaign based on his response to the pandemic. He will point to countries like Italy that have major infections as proof that his travel ban from China was prudent. He will point to countries like Canada that initially condemned his travel ban only to follow his example. He will point to how American labs recovered after a slow start and began delivering unprecedented numbers of tests and how factories quickly retooled to make medical supplies. Biden will be left with nothing to run on except ‚ÄúI‚Äôd have done the same things but I‚Äôd have done them better.‚Äù Unless the virus hits the US as hard as Italy, that will be a lame platform and he will go down to defeat.",https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-COVID-19-to-the-American-presidential-election,Brilliant analysis.

Tricking,"What are the best tricks to take over a room, in the charismatic sense?"," Get momentum early. After walking into a room, it takes no more than a few moments to determine how our night is going to go. Far too often we arrive at events, check-in at the front without a word and silently make our way through coat check, then enter the event, being as forgettable as the next person handing off their jacket. We then walk in awkwardly and feel an instant shock of  ‚Äúoh crap I don‚Äôt recognize anyone now what do I do.‚Äù We still haven‚Äôt said a word as we scan the room for a familiar face because we are uncomfortable and hopefully they will help us warm up to this social thing.

I am a social guy and often assume I can just go to any party dead ass sober alone and be a star. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to warm up‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI am a social person, this is easy‚Äù Then, there I am at 2 am walking home thinking  ‚Äúgood god that was awful‚Äù I am indeed social but the loud music, the dark lights and well-lubricated, tightly woven social circles make it much harder. Starting your social momentum is insanely difficult at the main event. This is why pregames exist. My answer isn‚Äôt to go to pregames, although that could help, but garner social momentum before you arrive. I‚Äôve learned there is no one single trick that makes you the life of the party. WE ALL have had moments where we run the spotlight of our social circle. It could be family or friends, whatever. We have all told captivating stories. The thing is is that in those scenarios we are just comfortable enough to be ourselves. Everyone is interesting if they feel confident enough to speak their mind. With social confidence I have seen tons of ‚Äúintroverted‚Äù or ‚Äúboring‚Äù friends take the spotlight and never look back. Once they were on, they were on. They didn‚Äôt need someone to tell them how. Here are ways I have started to get social momentum early Spend the day of a big event out doing other social activities (sports, comedy, arcade) Chatting up my Uber driver. Going to a pregame. Chatting up people in line. Chatting up people at baggage check. Just think back to that one time you owned the spotlight in a social situation. Did someone whisper to you an hour before how to be funny? No. You already knew how. You just needed the confidence to deliver on it in that moment. Be that brave soul who asks inappropriate questions and laughs at all the wrong times. We yearn for you.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-tricks-to-take-over-a-room-in-the-charismatic-sense,,,,,
Tricking,What are some cool JavaScript tricks?,"There's so many. Just keep in mind that, while these exist, and seem cool, they probably  don't  need to be seen in any production website.   Swap variables without a temp variable:   var a = 2 var b = 4 var b = [a,a=b ][0] Unless you have a really giant project with tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code, or a code interview, don't do this. A temporary variable isn't the worst thing in the world.   There's insanity to be done with type coercion: var a = +[];          // a == 0 var b = false + true; // b == 1 var c = true + true;  //c == 2 var d = !0;           // d == true Just, please, don't  actually  use this anywhere. This kind of type coercion is useful for code contests and hackathons. It's absolutely unreadable anywhere else.  You can write actual, functional JavaScript that uses type coercion   . It is a thing of evil. People who obfuscate their JavaScript are either evil, or assholes. Don't be either.  You don't  have  to declare  var  at the top of a function: Instead of function(a){ var b=1; } you could write function(a,b) { b=1; } This is because the variable name is declared as an argument. It saves you having to write var a whole lot, but it could confuse anyone else looking at your code. They might think you're actually passing these arguments into your function somewhere.   My favorite:  .call() Say you want to iterate over the properties in an object. var listitems = document.querySelectorAll('li');  You could try: for (i = 0; i < listitems.length; i++) { var listitem = listitems[i]; // do things } Or, you can use  .call()  to simply  forEach  this bad boy: [].forEach.call(listitems, function(listitem) { //do things }) call()  simply lets you apply your own  this . So in the above example, instead of an empty array being the  this , you're using  listitems , instead.  [edit] I can't help myself. one more example with  .call() Say you wanted to you reverse a string. Well, reversing stuff is the thing of arrays. So, why not take the magic power of an array, and call it on a string: var hey = 'hello world'; var yeh = [].reverse.call(hey.split('')).join(''); // ""dlrow olleh"" call()  is useful when you want to use methods that don't usually exist on properties   .  ",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cool-JavaScript-tricks,"It is worth noting you can use the .call() method for classical inheritance as well, since in JS you can write classes as functions.","On the variable swap - aren‚Äôt you implicitly creating that array, too?

Tricking,"What are some uncommon tricks used to protect software from reverse engineering? Specifically, tricks that are subtle or vengeful.","Back in the MSDOS days there were quite a few tricks that I found amusing: Locate the SP (stack pointer) to some code area.
Why this was a good protection? Debuggers worked by placing a special opcode ‚ÄòCC‚Äô before the code line you wanted to stop. (This is a short version for INT 3.) or setting a special flag, which invoked INT 1 after each instruction. The interrupt call required to push the return pointer to the stack, and the debugger needed to save all registers again stack usage. All in all, if you stepped into the trap, then you messed up a portion of the code. Of course, if you noticed the trap, then you could just jump over it. Override INT1/3
 As noted above, INT 1 and INT 3 is crucial for debugger operation. You can override them to provide helpers or other tools during execution. Combined with #1, this is a real time waster for the hacker.
Of course you can change every INT 1/3 calls with a different interrupt handler and patch the binary, but it requires effort. Additionally, if the shorthand version is used (‚ÄúCC‚Äù) you needed to cleverly find space for the extra byte for the alternative interrupt call. (Interrupt call required two bytes) Hiding instructions
 This was very sneaky: It took advantage of the fact, that debuggers display the OP codes line by line assuming, there is no extra data between them. But what happens, if you place one or two bytes which is a prefix for a big instruction eg. MOV [eax+disp32],imm32. This instruction needs two addresses each 4 bytes. Such instructions are fairly common, because they are the helpers for struct access. They look innocent. Now everything is set, all you need to do is to jump ‚Äúinto‚Äù the instruction:

This is what you see on your screen: (offset: instruction; offset can be anything arbitrary like C356)
 00:  jmp 0+3 02:  mov [eax+20CD2346],56345673 11:  next instruction The following instructions were executed instead:
1) 00: jmp 3
2) 03: evil instruction‚Ä¶ like setting SP (see #1 or overriding int1/3 #2)

Debuggers were so confused by this normally, that they did not reinterpret the instructions showing the real hidden instruction upon stepping ‚Äúinto‚Äù. Encryption
 Most of the above tricks could be seen from the outside looking at the binary. This last ingredient made is very hard to analyze: the actual code could be encrypted. Sometimes with something easy like a mere XOR or ROR (rotate bits in bytes) the value or more complicated like RC4. Additionally the code could be relocated to somewhere else in the address space making is hard to guess which byte is the true origin of the code you would like to alter. There was a tool called hackstop or something like this. It employed all of these tricks: encrypting the binary using several stages. All layers shuffled the content and encrypted it again. It was virtually impossible to decrypt a binary protected with that tool. (Although it is not impossible, only need time and create special tooling) Funfacts: I‚Äôve seen #3 used by Java obfuscators also! Some windows DLLs also employed encryption, they decrypted the exported functionality in the init() call. They went out of fashion due to more secure execution environments, which prevents rewriting your code. I‚Äôve used some of these methods to protect my work in the past. I‚Äôve also written an encryptor (but with one layer only.)",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-uncommon-tricks-used-to-protect-software-from-reverse-engineering-Specifically-tricks-that-are-subtle-or-vengeful,,,,,
Tricking,What are some astonishing Maths tricks?,"Here are four mathematical ‚Äòmagic tricks‚Äô you can try on your friends. The first trick is the following: Tell your friends to type a three digit number on their phone calculator. You are going to guess each and every one of their numbers. Tell them to multiply that number by  91 . They now tell you the last three digits of their calculator‚Äôs display. You somehow, mysteriously, tell them the number they started with! The second, third and fourth tricks are the same as above, except they multiply their number by  381  (second trick), by  579  (third trick) and by  889  (fourth trick). In fact, you may want to mix it up: if you have four friends, you may want to tell one of them to multiply their number by  91 , your second friend by  381 , your third friend by  579  and your fourth friend by  889 . How do you guess their original number? If they multiplied by  91 , all you need to do is to multiply the number they tell you by  11 , and read off the last three digits. (This can be done mentally, if you‚Äôre good enough, to make the trick more impressive.) If they multiplied by  381 , multiply the number they tell you by  21 , and read off the last three digits. (This is a bit more difficult to do mentally, but it can be done with a bit of practice.) If they multiplied by  579 , multiply the number they tell you by  19 , and read off the last three digits. (This is even more difficult to do mentally, so be careful.) If they multiplied by  889 , multiply the number they tell you by  9 , and read off the last three digits. Example: Say the number your friends chose was  358 .  358\times 91=32578 , so they tell you ‚Äò 578 ‚Äô. You mentally multiply  578  by  11  by performing the addition  578+x780 , to get  xx358 , (note that you do not need to work out the full addition) so the original number is  358 . Or if they multiplied by  381 , then  358\times 381=136398 , so they tell you ‚Äò 398 ‚Äô. You mentally multiply  398  by  21  by performing the addition  x960+398=xx358  (again you don‚Äôt need to work out the full addition), so the original number was  358 . Or if they multiplied by  579 , then  358\times 579=207282 , so they tell you ‚Äò 282 ‚Äô. Here, you mentally multiply  282  by  19  by first multiplying by  20  ( 282\times 2=564 , then append a zero), and then work out  5640-282  ( 640-282  is enough), getting  358 . Or if they multiplied by  889 , then  358\times 889=318262 , so they tell you ‚Äò 262 ‚Äô. You multiply  262  by  9  by subtracting  2620-262 , getting  x358 . The trick works because of the following four very simple arithmetic facts: 11\times 91=1001. 21\times 381=8001. 19\times 579=11001. 9\times 889=8001. What we are doing here is performing multiplication modulo  1000 . Very easy to understand and to explain. But your friends will be completely mystified! This would also be a great way of introducing groups, rings and fields to an undergraduate class. Technically,  11  and  91  are  multiplicative inverses  in the ring  (\mathbb{Z}_{1000},+ \bmod 1000,\times\bmod 1000) , and so are the pairs  (21, 381) ,  (19, 579)  and  (9, 889) . In fact, an element in this ring has a multiplicative inverse if and only if it is coprime with  1000  ‚Äî in this case, it means that the number is not divisible by  2  or  5  (so any number that ends with  1,3,7  or  9  is fine, otherwise it‚Äôs not.) This means that you can find your own pairs of numbers that are multiplicative inverses modulo  1000 , and repeat this trick for these pairs. For example,  17\times 353=6001 , so if you multiply a three digit number  n  by  353 , then you may recover  n  by multiplying the last three digits of the answer by  17  (and read off the last three digits if necessary). The above is also how some cryptographic systems work, by the way, so this ‚Äòmagic trick‚Äô is also appropriate for a cryptography class.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-astonishing-Maths-tricks,"Nice ones, Alexander. Thanks.",Works well except when the three digit number is 100.,Awesome! These tricks are impressive :),"‚Äúnote that you do not need to work out the full addition‚Äù But if you did, the first three digits would just be the same as the last three digits.",Wouldn‚Äôt 19 and 21 be equally difficult since you multiply by 20 and then add or subtract?

Tricking,What are some of the short tricks for JEE questions?,"You need to know a lot of tricks to solve JEE questions as it woulf save much time. Try to solve the questions using mathematical tricks as it would help you to solve long questions just in a nick of time.  Sometimes you might waste time in solving long mathematical calculations when it could be done using mathematical tricks. For eg. 255*1011*652 In that case, you might try to solve long calculations which could be easily done using simple tricks. In case, the options' unit digits are different that you can simply use this trick: unit digit of 5 * unit digit of 1 * unit digit of 2= 10  2. The unit digit of answer is 0. You just have go choose the option whose unit digit is 0. As simple as that! When the options are given in different dimensions than you can simply apply the dimensional method to find the answer. Let‚Äôs say, there is a question in which you have to find velocity of an electromagnetic field with weird orientation. Its field values are given as B and E. The options are given as: (a) (2E/B) 1/2 (b) (2B/E) (c) (2E/B) (d) (2B/E) 1/2 Now, you already know: Dimensions of an Electric Field are (M1L1T-3A-1), and* Dimensions of a Magnetic Field are (M1L0T-2A-1).Hence, only E/B gives you the Dimension of Velocity, which is (L1T-1). We do not need the square root as it will lead to the root of velocity too.So, our answer is (c) in this case. You do not really need to check for ‚Äò2E‚Äô as only one option gives you correct dimensions.  3. Never ever leave any question like match the following which has no negative marking. Because in some of the cases, even your guess might be correct.  4. When you get options like: (a) 15 mg (b) 36 g (c) 78g (d) 15g Than you can see that three options are in mg and one is in g. So, the answer might be in g. Moreover, 15 is repeated twice so the coreect answer is 15 g i.e (d)  5. About 60% of the answers are not the extreme ones (neither the highest nor the lowest values) . In case, you are guessing than don't choose the extreme values.  6. Try assuming values when you need to find an expression or series. If n is any positive integer then 1+3+5+‚Ä¶+(2n1): n n+1 2n+1 n¬≤ For 1 term, the sum is 1 For upto two terms, the sum is 1+3=4 For upto three terms, the sum is 1+3+5=9 For upto four terms, the sum is 1+3+5+7=16 So, here we got n^2 as answer as upto 1 is 1, upto 2 is 4 , upto 3 is 9.  7. Despite the fact that trigonometry and kinematics are easy, it takes much part of the time which could be used to revise about 10‚Äì15 of other topics as it is very fast. In this, way you can apply tricks to save time. You can also opt for online paid courses to learn many tricks to solve JEE questions.

Pepe the frog,What is an example of successful modern day propaganda?,"RT and Sputnik are an interesting example of a totally new, and seemingly successful approach to propaganda. Earlier, all propaganda ranging from religious sermons to war broadcasts aimed at  convincing  you. Our modern Putinist propaganda aims at  confusing  the audience. Earlier you could easily figure for yourself what exactly the propagandist wanted you to believe. Messages were consistent and clear, any contradictions were a sign of a sloppy work. Not anymore. The new propaganda teaches you  to trust no one ,  believe in nothing . Whatever you see from RT and Sputnik, as well as from associated, half-associated and non-associated resources in their orbit, for any claim they come with there‚Äôs always at least one contradicting it. This has roots in our domestic loyalist propaganda. Here, you can see a paradox: the ‚Äúnudge-nudge, wink-wink‚Äù factor is so pronounced that the simple act of believing the propaganda reveals in you either an enemy or a muggle. The resulting picture is a dark, chaotic universe driven by hidden players who rarely show their face, never reveal their true motives, have no principles and no remorse.

Pepe the frog,Why are there people defending the French movie Cuties People?,"Why did people gripe when General Leia used the Force to fly through space? Culture wars bullshit.  Cuties is a travesty of a film. Having seen precisely 1 minute of it, long story, I feel confident in saying that it is a travesty. Maybe it has a positive message about the over-sexualization of children in society? Don‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt care. The above collection of stills from the film might be without context, but they‚Äôre the sort of shots where context couldn‚Äôt make it better. Those are actual 14 year olds playing with condoms, wearing revealing clothing, and twerking. No amount of context could ever make this OK. Which isn‚Äôt to say that we shouldn‚Äôt talk about the media we expose our children to. Just that this conversation needs to happen without toeing the line of obscenity laws.  This is Ma√Ømouna Doucour√©, the black, female French-Senegalese director of Cuties. A refugee who came to France and made a deeply personal film about her experiences of culture shock as a child. And the people attacking that deeply personal film ‚Äúcensor‚Äù stills of it using Pepe the Frog, a recognized hate symbol. Doucour√© checks all the boxes when it comes to the ‚ÄúProgressive In-group‚Äù. Black, female, Muslim, foreign and outspokenly feminist. Many of the people who criticize her work are from the ‚ÄúProgressive Out-group‚Äù, namely straight, white, conservative men. For people who want to appear ‚Äúwoke‚Äù it‚Äôs easy to dismiss criticism of Cuties as coming entirely from Deplorables. The film did win a prestigious award at Sundance, after all. It‚Äôs not accurate of course. People from all around the political spectrum have pointed out that it‚Äôs hypocrisy to make a film that criticizes sexualization of chilren that itself sexualizes children. But the film has taken on a life of its own as a political rallying cry. And that‚Äôs really, really dumb. Edit :  As multiple people have pointed out in the comments, Pepe the Frog isn't really a hate symbol. He's a character from the indie comic Boy's Club who became a meme. Once he was about to enter the mainstream, 4chan started spreading the rumor that he was a fascist symbol, as a joke. And this led to both the alt-right and actual fascists adopting him as a symbol. The ADL has more information, as well as examples of the Pepe meme being used to promote hatred, which I refuse to post here. Pepe the Frog Edit2  : This answer was written from an American perspective. In America Cuties would be almost universally seen as exploitative of children were it not for the politics surrounding it. However the film is French. And as multiple Frenchmen have pointed out, the film's depiction of children is much more acceptable according to French culture. Interpret that as you will. Edit3 : Netflix has now been indicted in Texas over this film. Any comparisons between Cuties and child pornography are now perfectly valid. I rest my case.  https://tw.tinf.io/RepMattSchaefer/status/1313517817942212608",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-people-defending-the-French-movie-Cuties-People,"I think the difference here is that, for the young actresses (and their parents/guardians), there is full consent it is not considered ‚Äúexploitation of children‚Äù because they are fully aware of what will be happening, and know that everything is just for a movie and not really. it is people playing a part it is the same with how beating children is unacceptable, but having a child actor be beaten on screen (but done with angles, effects and well-done makeup to make convincing bruises) is okay it is the same as how murder is wrong, but depicting a death of any person in a film is okay. is it better to show a controversial topic like this, by compiling actual footage showing terrible child sexualization, or depict it thru movie magic?",Cuties is the equivalent of beating a dog and then getting praised for it because you raised awareness.

Pepe the frog,What are Trump's superhero powers?,"What are Trump's superhero powers? Trump has the power of persuasion. Not exactly as powerful as Purple Man's power, but there are similarities. The main difference is that Trump's power may emanate from the pheromones found within his hair. Therefore I dub him‚Ä¶.Orange Man!

People on 4chan realised that if they claimed something was racist, homophobic, et al, people would believe them, and these things would stop being used. Pepe the Frog, the peace sign, the 'OK' sign, all of these things are now considered hate symbols because people on 4chan felt it would be funny to make people think of them as hate symbols; it's a game, social experiment, and statement on the arbitrary manner in which we decide what is acceptable and what isn't, but most of all, it's for the lulz.",https://www.quora.com/What-s-the-point-of-4chan-making-people-think-milk-is-racist-the-peace-sign-is-transphobic-and-the-other-strange-stuff-as-of-late,My Gfs mum and step dad both insist the circle game is a white supremacist thing so I've been considering attempting to make fist bumping a white supremacist thing as well.

Ibanez Series S,What is your favorite piece of music gear that you own?,"Thanx for the A2A Jamie. My favorite piece of gear is my 2019 Gibson Les Paul Classic Gold Top :  It‚Äôs such a joy to play. I pick it up and I just wanna crank that 100w tube amp on the right to 10 and rock like my life depends on it. I can spend hours in my studio playing her..some times I do just that. Some times when I went in with the intention of laying down some tracks, I get lost just rockin‚Äô out lol. After an hour or so I realize I went in to record, not jam and laugh out loud to nobody in the room but me. A close second is my newest addition to the family. My 2020 Ibanez RG450MB :  I needed a guitar with a tremolo (whammy bar) for some Joe Satriani songs I have been wanting to record. I decide to go with a guitar with a maple fretboard this time. Every guitar I owned up till then has either an Ebony or a Rosewood fretboard. I wanted to see how the maple would feel. I had to buy this one online. Not something I like to do. I prefer to play a guitar beforehand and make sure it feels ‚Äúright‚Äù, but the current climate made that impossible. But once it arrived and I changed out the strings to my preferred brand/gauge (Ernie Ball Regular Slinky‚Äôs) and did a complete set up (I set up all my guitars myself), plugged her in, it blew me away. YES ! It felt ‚ÄúRight‚Äù. The radius of the fretboard is very different from my Les Pauls, which have a 12:1 ratio. The Ibanez has a 16:1 ratio which makes the fretboard flatter. It is a ‚Äúshredders‚Äù fretboard. It‚Äôs designed To allow a faster flow across the board..and it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs a lead players dream. The guitar was fairly cheap ($399us), I didn‚Äôt expect to play it as much as my Beloved Classic, so I didn‚Äôt want to spend more than I had to for a decent quality guitar. I have made 2 modifications to it since I bought it. I swapped out the stock Quantum bridge pickup for a DiMarzio Satchur8 and changed the stock potentiometers to CTS 500k‚Äôs. They give you much better control and actually have a taper when rolled on/off. It is one of those mods that when done to a lower cost guitar can make a HUGE difference. It should be one of the first mods done IMO. And if you can solder, it‚Äôs easy the cost is super cheap. I paid $8 for a pair of CTS short shaft 500k pots. A close third favorite is my 500 series rack:  Just below it and out of the pic is my 12 space rack. It‚Äôs loaded with older rack gear..EQ, Compressors, Tube Preamp, Power Conditioner, Power Switcher, Patchbay and my Audio Interface. All the effects listed are old and while I occasionally will use them in my projects, they are really outdated, some considered obsolete in todays recording world. Today, most are replaced by plugins and incorporated ‚Äúin the box‚Äù. But the use of external preamps and more modern versions of older gear is very popular, useful and can be a vast improvement sound wise to a VST plugin. I sold that ‚Äò80‚Äôs Peavey Tube head in the very first pic for just over $500us. I actually got it for free. It was on the LetGo app listed as non-functioning. It cost me $20us to fix and I only used it a little for about a month. I used the money towards jumping into the ‚Äú500 Series‚Äù rack game. The rack delivers the power and routing. It can hold 6 different modules that simply slide in. You can swap modules in less than a minute. The rack also has the ability to ‚Äúchain‚Äù modules with the flick of a couple switches. So I can link them to each other and use a single input and a single output cable. A really cool feature if you think about it. Imagine the jumble of wires it would take to link them all together. I usually link 3‚Äì4 depending on what I am recording..like the back view of that 12 space rack I mentioned lol. When I record bass tracks I link one of the Preamps to the EQ, that to the Compressor and record. For vocals I go with a Preamp to the DIYre Colour module. Sometimes I will add the EQ, but not always. Most of the time it‚Äôs better to do EQ and compression (on all things) post recording. You can‚Äôt remove it afterwards, but you can add. Besttwr to have the option. I have acquired other modules now. Like most gear, it can become addictive lol.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-favorite-piece-of-music-gear-that-you-own,Thanks for the great answer!,,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What acoustic guitar makers have made double cutaway guitars, and why are they so rare?","They are very rare. Here are a few companies I ran into. Ibanez: The Talman series was one version. Those guitars had a stratocaster type shape. Fender: The Stratocoustic was one. Danelectro: This brand from the 50‚Äôs has one that also has an electric pickup as well. Wechter: I don‚Äôt know as much out them. Shannon: Same I don‚Äôt know has much. As to why they are rare, I can only offer 2 theories. The first being that an acoustic purist tends to prefer more of a dreadnaught style guitar. Some believe the big bodies create big tone. That is not always the case. Some of these guitars have the electric guitar pickup as well as the traditional acoustic pickup. That being said, I know many acoustic players that can‚Äôt stand an electric guitar at all. I can‚Äôt relate because I tend to prefer the electric guitar and I find models like these are comfortable to play a lead on. Here is my second thought, I am not sure about the neck stability. Traditional acoustic guitars don‚Äôt always have a truss rod on them to keep them stable. They are mostly glued on necks. Therefore, if you have a dual cutaway, it would almost have to be a bolt on type neck. I can‚Äôt find an clear answer on whether they had to use truss rods on those are not. Going back to the original idea, I think it is more likely the detrimental to tone since a double cutaway will always be a smaller sized guitar.",https://www.quora.com/What-acoustic-guitar-makers-have-made-double-cutaway-guitars-and-why-are-they-so-rare,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,I want to buy a guitar and learn it by myself. My budget is not too high (4k-5k). Which one should I buy?,"Buying Guitar is investment for serious guitar players. However, horrible sounding fancy guitar more sales around the world. AtoZ of Guitar buying:
(a) Never buy Acoustic guitar online. Even branded acoustic can sound poor than cheap guitar.
(b) If you are learning and don't know much. Always better to take assistance from someone who had played guitar for years.
(c) Check fret wire, should be smooth and firmly fixed without defects on fret board(i.e. rough edges are not fine and hurt finger much during playing)
(d) Check Guitar Neck should be firm scaled with fret wire distances and strings should be just 1mm or 2mm above the fret wires. (i.e. neither too close nor too distanced from fret board)
(e) Check wood box, it should be uniform and without any breakage at wood joints in edges. Check with torch inside the wood box too. There will be weird reaction by shop owner but don't bother.
(f) Knock the wood box (sound box) with your fist or lower flesh part of thumb base. The sound should be close to base kick. Slap the curve part of wood box and sound should be like flat tomb hit.
(g) Check Guitar Bridge (i.e. the string hook part on wood box) It should be fix strongly without any gap between wood box and bridge wood. Use any visit card to check gaps in it.
(h) Check Guitar keys, it should be high quality without any defects. (i.e. Keys should be good quality, free from friction grip due to rust on screw junctions, strong enough to hold strings tension and smooth enough for player to tune guitar without any problem. Check quality while tuning guitar.
(i) Play G major, A minor , D major cords and E minor chord with each string sound clearly. The sound should be clear and warm.
(j) Rub your finger and thumb on guitar neck to confirm smoothness alone the guitar neck length.
(k) Make sure guitar belt hook are not bolted near to guitar keys on neck. It must on base body and neck and wood box junction of guitar.
(l) Brands for Acoustic guitar
1) Under Rs 3000 to 5000 : Pluto, Polo, Givson, Aria, Hobner etc (i.e. take someone assistance who had played guitar for years to select good sounding guitar in this budget. Guitar will start sounding creepy after 6 to 8 months)
2) Under Rs5000 to 8000 : G&B, Pluto, Aria, Yamaha classic C30 and C70 (best for serious beginner with interest in western classic) this range is good investment (four to five years) for serious guitar player.
3) Under Rs8000 to Rs 15000 : G&B studio version, Yamaha, Pluto, Epiphone, Fender (Good investment for Home recording and Artist in budget)
4) Above Rs15000 (Studio recording) : Takamine G series, Yamaha Pro series, Taylor, Martin, Seville
5) Blueberry Guitars : Perfect craft of wood, art and guitar sound. (i.e., for Guitarligious soles, Guitar worshipers, and Art collectors)
6) Guitar by Luthiers : These are Hand made guitar and Every Luthier has his/her USP.
7) Electric guitar Rs 15000 to Rs 35000 : Yamaha, Ibanez, Kort, BC Rich, Gibson.
(j) Wood quality affects tone and durability of guitar. Expensive guitar don't necessary sound good. Most of Pro-guitarist select guitar on the basis of quality not brand name.
(k) For small finger and left hand guitarist one should more careful and search more cause suitable guitar not available every time.
(l) For Small finger try Koren, Indonesian or Vietnamese guitar brands.
(m) For Electric guitar, one can try branded Electric guitar online. However, it is better to do proper search before buying.
(n) Most of rules will be same as Acoustic guitar. Like Fret, Neck Keys, Belt etc.
(o) Select the Electric guitar as per your music and tone requirement. Electric Guitar are three types solid-body, semi-hollow, and hollow-body.
(p) Solid body guitar are good choice for Loud amplification and synthesized effects. (Popular choice are Ibanez, Kort, Yamaha, Jackson, BC Rich, Gibson, Les Paul)
(q) Semi-hollow body electric guitars are good choice for Acoustic sound with high amplification.
(r) Hollow-body (also knows as jazz guitar), give good acoustic sound with mild amplification but as high amplification give mad horse sound.
(s) Select guitar modal as per required Scale Length, Intonation and number of frets. These things are very important for artist working on professional level. It effect the tone quality and range during recording.
(u) Make sure which bridge one want to use during guitar playing tremolo bridge or stop-tail bridge has his own advantages and disadvantages. It is purely individual choices.
(v) Guitar Picks ups are the most crucial part of electric guitar. Single coil (most common), Humbucker Pickups (humming sound good for rock and metal) and Piezo pickups (synthesizer effect)
(w) Don't buy combo pack for electric guitar. Value pack are actually fooling packs.
(x) Buy Electric guitar and amplifier separately. If you are playing and practice alone at home better to plug electric guitar in laptop or PC through, midi or audio cable available at affordable price.
(y) Amp and guitar effect are not must buy at initial for electric guitar. One can enjoy guitar playing with dedicated GNU/Linux operating systems like Ubuntu studio, 64 studio, K studio, Artix, Musix etc.
(z) Don't be fool in better guitar = better player. Practice! Practice! Practice! It makes perfect.",https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-buy-a-guitar-and-learn-it-by-myself-My-budget-is-not-too-high-4k-5k-Which-one-should-I-buy,Good efforts ..... Thanku,Thats some serious advice...Nice one :),,,
Tricking,What is Ludo King‚Äôs trick to win?,The secret of Ludo King‚Äôs trick is in the  strategy  you need to set while playing with different players. The dice is random and you need to best see how to move your pawns so that you reach the home fast  without getting captured . Also see:   What are some games to play on a train journey? Here are the tricks: 1. At the start focus on taking all the pawns out ready to move towards the home. 2. Strategically place the pawns on colored blocks or stars to keep the competitor from capturing your pawns. But don‚Äôt sit at one place for long. Make timely smart moves and stay safe while moving ahead. 3. In the initial stage of the game keep 2 pawns moving towards the home and 2 for capturing competitor pawns. Later take these two pawns towards the home fast. 4. Capture the opponent‚Äôs pawns more often to increase your chances of winning. 5. Don‚Äôt just run towards the home haphazardly. Be aware that the opponent pawn can capture your pawn if they get a chance. Move other pawns to divert the attention of the competitor and make a way for your desired pawn to the home. 6. Sometimes take risks to overtake the opponent‚Äôs pawn. No winning in Ludo King without risks! After all its a game of strategy and luck both. 7.  (My secret trick)-  Do not play with the same moves with every player. The tricks and moves vary from opponent to opponent and you need to adapt to their strategy and come up with a new strategy that will help you beat them in the game. Have a great Ludo King playing time! The recent addition to the Ludo King excitement is the Ludo King Show‚Ä¶You can participate in the Live Ludo King matches that are streamed on YouTube! ,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Ludo-King‚Äôs-trick-to-win,"Ludo king is being very popular now a days. Here are some of the tricks which benefited me to win many games ‚Ä¢ Move more than 1 piece from start we sometimes move only one piece from start so if that gets killed further your game progress goes in vain If defeat is inevitable just turn your mobile data off and wait you will be returned your coins, this is how you can save your coins from losing. . Move your pieces strategically so that you don't come in front of your opponent's piece because in that case it becomes highly possible that your piece will be killed.","Once again it depends on luck. Example - Your 1 token is 4 away from the opponents token(who is in safe zone). Your 2nd token is 8 steps ahead from the opponents token. You get 5, which one do you move. Everyone would move the 2nd token. Now the second token is 13 steps ahead of you. Now the opponent gets 6 then 5. You get 2. You are 4 steps ahead of your opponent. Your opponent gets 4. You die This is a very common thing in ludo where you get killed out of nowhere or vice-versa. Even when you play with strategy, sometimes you dont get the right number to kill the opponent. So bottom line: Even if you play with strategy you need luck to accompany it. Luck = 80%. Strategy = 20%.",,,
Tricking,What are some of the study tricks or methods that you know?,"Use this brain-hack to reduce distraction while studying . It involves delaying your response, letting the  slow thinking  mind come into action. So whenever you feel the urge to watch a video clip or access social media while studying, don‚Äôt just hump directly onto it, delay your response by 5 minutes, do nothing during this wait. After 5 minutes of idle sitting, you will realize the temptation will fade and you will get the strength to get back to study. How this works? Let‚Äôs find out. Based on the research of  Nobel Prize winner   Daniel Kahneman , mind has two way to response, for easy understanding say mind A & mind B . Mind A thinks fast, it controls your reflexes and reaction, as a result takes less effort. B is slow thinker, it takes information, process it slowly, it involves painful process of thinking and then it comes to decision. It involves problem solving. Now A is more fast and energy efficient, but it has low accuracy. Whereas B takes time to process, but it has higher accuracy. Whenever you practice delaying your response to distraction, you are letting your mind B takes control over mind A, so your chance of taking correct decision will increase. Thus you will be able to tackle distractions. So this technique will result in more focused work and study.

Tricking,What are some psychological tricks to use on your friends?,"Some of the psychological trick one should must try on their friend in different situation- THE TALK AND PILE If you want your friend to carry something just keep taking to them while handling them the object. Most people will automatically take it without thinking as their mind is thinking something else. eg- walking with a friend after you bought a 2l coke bottle and want him to carry it, just keep talking to him while handing him the bottle, most of the times people will just take the object automatically without thinking. GET RID If your friend making you bored and you want to get rid of it just make them feel insecure by looking at their hairline while they speak. They will definitely stop speaking as they will think something is wrong with them. HYPOTHETICAL TRUTH If you want people to like you more, ask them to do favours for you. People think that doing nice things for others will make them like them more, but actually, when you as someone to do a favour for you, their subconscious thinks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing something for this person, so I must like and care about them. THE BROCCOLI TRICK If you want your friend to agree with you just ask for higher number when they dis agree then ask four your actual requirement. They will see it as a great deal and will agree with you. THE PATERNAL WISDOM If you want people take you seriously, tell them what you say is what your father taught you. People tend to believe fatherly advice inherently. NEGOTIATION TRICK In negotiations or things of the sort, practice using silence. Most people are very uncomfortable with silence in these situation and are willing to break it by giving up a key point. SO AGREEABLE When asking someone a question,get them to agree with you by simply nodding you head. The action make them start to think that what you are saying is true and they should nod yes too, since our behavior are social. TRICK TO WIN THE ARGUMENT When arguing with your friend, act much calmer than them. This can cause them to say something particularly irrational which you can use against them.

Tricking,What are some coolest iphone tricks?,"Here are a few great iPhone tricks which can be useful to you:  1. Earbud Controls.  Click the volume + button on the remote on your Apple or Apple-compatible earbuds while in camera mode to click and shoot, or the middle button (play/pause), while in video mode, to take selfies. Press once to play or pause, twice to go to the next track, three times to go to the previous track.  2. Create custom vibration alerts.  Want to know if your best friend is calling without ever looking at the phone? Buried in the contact settings, a fun option lets you create custom vibration patterns for your contacts.
To do it, go to  Contacts , choose a contact, and tap  Edit  in the upper-right corner.
Then, scroll down and navigate to  Vibration > Create New Vibration . In the interactive screen, tap and hold to create a pattern, using long presses for long vibration notes, and so on. 3. Be more frugal with data.  If you're watching your data usage, it's a good idea to use a feature introduced in iOS 7: cellular data management.
With this tool, you can decide which apps get to use cellular data, and which apps can load only over Wi-Fi.
Head over to  Settings > Cellular  to disable cellular data usage for any installed apps. 4. Long-press for more characters.  Hidden beneath the unassuming characters of the iOS keyboard is a world of letters and symbols only available with a long-press.
For example, long-pressing the dash key reveals em and en dashes, while long-pressing the numeral 0 lets you insert a degree symbol.  5. Siri's hidden features.  Siri can handle really complex commands. She can even do things like set your alarm, and learn how to properly pronounce names. Make Siri listen, decide with a coin flip, search for a note or email, assign nicknames and relationships, launch apps are some interesting things Siri can do for you.  6. Shoot in burst mode.  Thanks to the iPhone 5S's fast processor, the camera now lets you shoot in burst mode, snapping multiple photos per second.
It's great for capturing sports, kids, and special moments you want every bit of. 7. Protect your privacy.  This tip will save your battery life  and  your privacy. Far, far into iOS's privacy settings is a setting that, when enabled, sends Apple your location data.
Some people don't care. If you do -- and you want a battery boost while you're at it -- disable the feature. Go to  Settings > Privacy > System Services  to toggle the option. 8. More diverse emoji.  With iOS 8.3, Apple released a redesigned emoji keyboard complete with a more racially diverse set of characters. In other words, instead of only finding one color of emoji faces and hands within the keyboard, you now have a more realistic sample of colors to represent the various races in the world. 9. Put a stop to iMessage spam.  If you've been getting iMessages that say you've won a cruise or a Best Buy gift card, you're probably a victim of iMessage Spam.
Fortunately, a quick trip to your iPhone settings can block these advertisers easily.  10. Blue or green messages?  If you own an iPhone, you may have noticed something odd in the Messages app: some messages are blue and some are green. What's the deal with that?
Short answer: blue ones have been sent or received using Apple's iMessage technology, while green ones are ""traditional"" text messages exchanged via Short Messaging Service, or SMS. To find out what those green or blue messages mean to you (and your phone bill). 11. Use AirDrop to send images.  Make sure both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are turned on. Any intended recipients will need to do likewise -- and perform the next two steps as well.
Access AirDrop settings by swiping up from the bottom of the screen to access Control Center. (This is the only way to do so; AirDrop doesn't appear anywhere in the actual Settings app.)
Tap AirDrop, then choose your visibility as Contacts Only or Everyone.
Now it's time to share. Open the Photos app, select one or more photos and then tap the Share button (located in the lower-left corner and represented by a square with an arrow pointing up out of it). 12. Faster Touch ID recognition.  Touch ID seems to have a beef with certain fingers, consistently requiring multiple scans before unlocking the device.
If this sounds familiar, try this: Go to Settings > Touch ID & Passcode. Here, enroll the same finger two to three times by choosing  Add a fingerprint .
Doing so will give Touch ID more information about your finger patterns, resulting in a faster scan.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-coolest-iphone-tricks,last tip about adding multiple profiles for the same finger/thumb never occurred to me. Going to try that one out!,,,,

I can move either eyebrow independently I can wiggle both ears independently If I wiggle both ears it moves my whole scalp I can flare my nostrils I can not only curl my tongue, but also make it big like a cigar.

Now slowly move your hands so your fingers on each hand point to the other hand. If you don't mess up you will be spinning opposite directions. I made up this trick. I can even do one fast and one slow at the same time. I have an expanding repitoir of tongue twisters On either hand I can touch my pinky to my middle finger below and my ring and index finger touch above, then switch so the pinky/middle is now bottom and the index/ring is on top.

Tricking,What are useful tricks in C++ or C that beginners rarely know?,"- You can achieve amazing runtime performance on some problems by using template metaprogramming. Beginners rarely think about what is done at compilation time and what is done at runtime. - When you have complicated types with lots of const in them always know that each const applies to left, except the first one (if available) which will apply to right. const int forever_young = 1;
is the same with
 int const forever_young = 1; and
 const char*const*const& what_the_fuck = &otherWTF;  can be easily read as
a reference  (const char*const*const & )
to a const pointer  (const char*const *const &)
that points to a const pointer  (const char *const *const&)
that points to a const char  ( const char *const*const&). -  Not everything must be defined in header files.
Defines symbols in the header file only when you want to use them from multiple translation units (cpp / cxx) otherwise you can directly define them in the implementation file. Which gets me to the next point of - Using anonymous namespaces or static keyword  namespace {     int no_one_outside_this_file_can_see_me = 0; }  static int i_also_cant_be_seen_anywhere_else = 0;  This will ensure no one will see that variable outside the file it is defined. For that purpose it works nicely for symbols defined in cpp files. static keyword will achieve a similar thing.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-useful-tricks-in-C++-or-C-that-beginners-rarely-know,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,How do different brands make acoustic guitars that sound different from each other?,"The methods to make acoustic guitars have not changed very much in the past 50 years. However, the use of CNC machines has resulted in very high accuracy of manufacturer. Plywood started being used around 40 years ago but the top is usually solid wood and spruce is the most popular top material. Mahogany remains one of the most popular woods to make the neck, sides, and back of a guitar and this wood produces the best sound, my opinion. There are slight variations in the bracing. I have four acoustic guitars that employ an arched design. Both Guild Guitars I own have an arched back to eliminate any bracing in the back. I also have a hand carved solid wood archtop with an arched back. Last I have on Epiphone tiger maple that is similar to electric guitars of the early 1950‚Äôs with an arch top and arch back. This guitar is made from maple wood and has a pre-amp and acoustic pickup. It has a unique sound. There are still some Maple guitars and a few companies make a jumbo size, usually around 17 inches across versus 16‚Ä≥ diameter. Rosewood is also a decorative wood usually doubling the cost and this does change the sound and provides enhanced bass tones. Ibanez used to make exotic series wood guitars but these appear to have lost market share in the past couple of years. There are more cosmetic differences in the manufacture of guitars than the bracing and basic patterns. Some luthiers are able to generate unique sounds but mostly the expense is whether a guitar is machine or hand made and inlay and other appearance features. In the past 20 years cutaway designs have become an extremely popular feature and guitar players who play electric usually desire this feature to get higher up the neck. The neck size is important as this can improve the playability of the guitar and the speed of playing notes. The sound of the instrument will change if solid aged wood is used versus plywood. However, much of the sound comes from the player and technique. I am particular about having low action and sometimes a luthier is needed to get this neck aligned and the action set as low as possible.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-different-brands-make-acoustic-guitars-that-sound-different-from-each-other,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What are some of the best string sets for a high-end acoustic guitar like Taylor, Baton Rouge, and Ibanez guitars?","I have a 1998 Langejans Walnut Grand Concert, which is a high end, hand built acoustic, built by Del Langejans of Holland, MI. Del is retired now, I understand he built about 1400 guitars in his career and many of them can be found in the hands of great players such as Peter Frampton, Phil Keaggy, Earl Klugh, Muriel Anderson, Paul Baloche the late Jerry Reed and more. At the time I bought mine, it was about the same cost as a 800 series Taylor but was a much finer acoustic IMHO.
Having said that, I asked Del what strings he recommended, knowing that he probably voiced his guitars by his choice of woods, design philosophy and more specifically by the way he configured and shaped his bracing. Del told me, I feel you‚Äôll get the best sound by using D‚ÄôAddario strings, BUT, your personal tone choice may be different than mine, so you may wish to experiment with different gages, compositions and brands. His display guitars had Elixir Coated strings to keep them fresh sounding.
Over 20 years, I tried lots of strings, GHS, GHS Juber Signatures, Elixir Phosphor Bronze, GHS Nickel wounds, D‚ÄôAddario regulars, DR‚Äôs, 80/20‚Äôs, etc. I never strayed from 12‚Äì53 / 12‚Äì54 gage, but in the end Del was right, my guitar sounds best with D‚ÄôAddario Phosphor Bronze strings. So, presently, I now stick with the DA coated strings for longevity and beautiful tone.
I recommend you give the builder/luthier a call or email and ask what they recommend based on your style, musical tastes. Sure, they are there to sell guitars but they are also there to help you enjoy your experience with their guitars.
But also, don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment as well to see if you get something you weren‚Äôt expecting. A set of strings are fairly inexpensive and you‚Äôre going to change them at least 6 times a year, so eventually you can try lots of different sets.
In the end, my guess, is you‚Äôll wind up with exactly (or very close to) what the builder recommended in the first place. The BEST advice I can offer you, no matter what brand you end up with, is to ENJOY your musical journey with the acoustic guitar. It‚Äôs a special reward in LIFE.

Ibanez Series S,Amplifiers:  Which are some great low budget Marshall combo guitar amps?,"I own a few Marshall‚Äôs. Plexi, Jcm 800, jmp-1, origin 50. Code 100. The Marshall code may seem like a good buy, however, they have a harsh sounding high end, that can‚Äôt be dialed out. IMO the best sounding Marshall I own is also the least expensive. The Origin series is an all tube amp made in Vietnam. I think it‚Äôs based on the JTM-45. Either way it sounds amazing. The 20 watt combo is $480 new on Amazon. That may sound pricey, but I can assure you, your buying a world class sounding tube amp with a world class speaker. Nothing to upgrade here. 20 ‚ÄúMarshall‚Äù watts is more than plenty. I turn it on 2 1/2and it‚Äôs at classic rock band level. It is not a high gain amp. It sounds close to a Plexi, but with even less gain. Think Doobie Brothers China Grove sound. It works very well with overdrive pedals. Add an MXR distortion + and you‚Äôve reached brown sound nirvana. It may go into 80‚Äôs rock territory with a ‚Äúthicker‚Äù sounding overdrive pedal, like a boss od-1 or a Ibanez ts9. But it doesn‚Äôt do modern rock tones well. If you want 80‚Äôs rock to modern rock, that‚Äôs Jcm-800 territory. Those are kinda pricey though. A used 50 watter will cost upward of at least $700. The DSL-40 is nice sounding and affordable. This is a high gain amp, capable of doing modern rock really well. High gain amps tend to not do classic rock so well. Not sure exactly why, but it seems like when I turn the gain on a high gain amp down, it just doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äú‚Äúright‚Äù to me. But then again, it‚Äôs not made for that. I‚Äôm not a high gain fan, as you can see. Although I have to admit, the dsl does that sound great.

Tricking,How does this mathematical trick work?,"The key is the number 1014. Therefore it will only work in 2014. Say your shoe size is  xx . Let‚Äôs call our answer  N. Step 1:  N = 5*xx. Step 2:  N = 5*xx+50 Step 3:  N = 100*xx+1000 Step 4:  N = 100*xx+1000+1014 = 100x+2014 Say your birth year is  y. Step 5:  N = 100*xx + 2014 -   y Lets divide this number into two parts ‚Üí N = (100*xx ) + (2014 - y) Now if you take a closer look: i) For any given number  xx,  the solution to  (100*xx)  will be the number xx followed by two zeros. For example, if your shoe size is 13, 100*13 will be equal to 1300. Let‚Äôs write this as  xx00 . ii) when you solve  (2014-y)  the output number always tells you how old were you in year 2014. Ex. If you are born in 1989, 2014 - 1989 will be equal to 25 which is your age. Let‚Äôs write this as 0025. What happens when you add numbers xx00 and 0025. You get xx25. So here xx is your shoe size and 25 is your age in year 2014. Let‚Äôs solve an example: I was born in 1989 and I wear size 11 shoes. For me this is the step by step progress: Multiply shoe size by 5 : 11 * 5 = 55 Add 50: 55+50 = 105 Multiply by 20 : 105 * 20 = 2100 or  1100 + 1000 Add 1014 : 2100+1014 or  1100 + 2014 Subtract 1989 : 1100 + 2014 - 1989 = 1100 + 25 Answer : 1100 + 25 = 1125 So the answer gave me back what I put in, the first two digits as my shoe size and last two as my age in year 2014. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Q . Where did this 2014 come from? Ans. It came when you added 1000 and 1014. Q . Can this formula fail? Ans. Yes, all we have to do is give a year of birth which when subtracted from 2014 will give a three digit number. Ex. An old man born in 1908 who wears size 07: Multiply shoe size by 5 : 07 * 5 = 35 Add 50: 35+50 = 85 Multiply by 20 : 85 * 20 = 1700 or  700 + 1000 Add 1014 : 1700+1014 or  700 + 2014 Subtract 1989 : 700 + 2014 - 1908 =  700 + 106 Answer :700 + 106 =  806  which is wrong. Q . How to make this formula work in 2016? Ans. Just ask to add 1016 instead of 1014. Simple.",https://www.quora.com/How-does-this-mathematical-trick-work,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,What are good alternatives to an Epiphone Wildkat?,Ibanez makes some semi hollows that are well made. And while you state you need a smaller neck you don‚Äôt mention if you mean scale length. Finger board width or neck profile. Most Ibanez guitars have pretty slim neck profiles. If that‚Äôs what your looking for. I can‚Äôt remember ever picking up a Ibanez and saying ‚ÄúGee! This Neck Feels Like a Early Fifties Gibson‚Äù meaning some relatively girthy palm filling neck. If anything the opposite is true. Most seem to have thin speedy metal shred necks. A friend collects Ibanez guitars and I think the carved top semi hollow line is the artist series. But that may be more of a trim range. But there‚Äôs been a lot a semi hollow or hollow body jazz guitars over the years. Most seem to have double cutaways like a ES 335 but I think of seen a few single cutaways like the Wildcat. I‚Äôve not played a Wildcat personally so I have no idea what neck profile they are using. I do have a Epi 339 Ultra III that fills the semi hollow bill for me. To me it has a very nice neck. Not fat. Not to slim. My 339 has humbucking pickups. My Ibanez collecting lady friend loves my ES 339 and when they had a special sale she picked up a ES 339 Pro with P90‚Äôs in Pelham Blue. And it sounds and plays excellent. Something a bit more Wildcat like might be a Epi ES 175. I rarely see these and have only handle one several years ago. My memory - which is not infallible remembers a surprisingly girthy neck. It‚Äôs entirely possible that‚Äôs what they are using on the Wildcat. I‚Äôll just say that if the next Epi ES 175 plays like that first one I‚Äôm buying it. Somehow. The one I played was a limited run Nitrocellulose lacquer model and rang like a bell and sounded like a cannon. But they are a full depth body and believe the Wildcat is a thin line? So that might be a deal breaker. Last but not least is the Epi Les Paul Florentine. These have a very heavily chambered body. They are not quite as resonant as a full semi hollow but stupidly light and sound great. I bought a new one and liked it so much that I snagged the first used one I saw at a great price as a backup. Killer guitar. They are Humbucker only but if you see one hanging on the wall it might be worth a test drive. If you prefer P90‚Äôs there are Humbucker sized P90 pickups that will drop right in. I absolutely agree with Patrick Ferrin in that half a Humbucker is not a P90 by any stretch. But it is a single coil option that‚Äôs on the Pro Series Epiphones. These are guitars I‚Äôve had some experience with. I‚Äôve never really played a WildKat because I‚Äôm not really looking for that style guitar. I don‚Äôt know what features of the WildKat lead you to that model or what specifically you don‚Äôt like about the neck. But the ES 339 with P90‚Äôs is a outstanding guitar if your looking for a traditional warm P90 sound and don‚Äôt mind double cutaways. If your looking for a more archtop type tone there are probably quite a few Ibanez guitars out there. Many of the big name Jazzers played these in the eighties. If one of the attractions was a lightweight and lively guitar the Les Paul Florentine may fit the bill better than you think. Regardless good luck on your quest. It‚Äôs out there. I‚Äôve got a particular Gibson Les Paul and a ES 335 with pretty monster necks and they took a little getting used to. The 335 in particular is a handful. But I was able to adapt and big neck guitars often have a bit more presence to my ears that made it worth the struggle. But I‚Äôve taught a few beginners and watched people struggle with necks that don‚Äôt fit their hands well. So finding something that is comfortable and easy to play is pretty primary. Us long fingered experienced folks can adapt. My girlfriend and her friend both did much better with the Squier Affinity Series Guitars with the narrow nut. It‚Äôs only a 2mm difference in width but makes a huge difference.,https://www.quora.com/What-are-good-alternatives-to-an-Epiphone-Wildkat,,,,,

So, today I will tell you top tips and tricks (or planning tips) that will help to win more contests and more money. #1Don‚Äôt be greedy. As you know, this fantasy app requires a lot of patience. Here Don‚Äôt be greedy means Don‚Äôt play every match to make more money. For example : I am a beginner and I don‚Äôt have sufficient knowledge about football. In greed of making more money, I play ‚Äúmatch to match‚Äù one after, continue wasting money in football contests. So at the conclusion of this point, I will say that, play only those matches which you have sufficient knowledge of. #2 Play selective matches . One of the biggest mistakes of beginners is that they don‚Äôt have patience. They want to play every match, they join every contest whether they have sufficient knowledge or not. Finally, the result of their greediness, is that they lose all their money. I will suggest to all that avoid joining every contest as much as possible. If you want to become successful in this fantasy sport, #3Research before playing. To get strong held in Dream 11, it is very important to all of us research before playing any contest. whether it is a cricket contest, whether it is a football contest or whether it is another. But research on the following topics is more important than all of these. ‚Ä¢ Research about player‚Äôs recent performance. ‚Ä¢ Research about the pitch condition. ‚Ä¢ Follow the toss details. ‚Ä¢ How teams perform at batting first and bowling first. ‚Ä¢ How the player performs against the opposite bowlers. ‚Ä¢ Renew your team before half hour. #Research about player recent performance. If you want to create your Dream Team in Dream 11 and want to win more money in this fantasy sport, Then, it is necessary to check the player's recent performance. How he performed in recent matches and also researched the ground performance of the player. How he performed in recent matches on that ground. #Research about pitch condition.  Before creating your Dream Team, we should have a Pitch report. How it is helpful for bowlers ( Pacers and Spinners) and how it is useful for batsmen. Find the average probability of bowlers and batsmen and create your team from the most probable players. If you do not get any reports about pitch conditions, Then I will suggest that research the ground history of recent matches. You will get it on cricbuzz easily. #Follow the toss details. After being tossed, everyone knows which team will bat first and which will bowl. So, pick the players according to your research. For example:  if the match is Australia vs Bangladesh. As you know, Australia is better than both ( Batting and Bowling) from Bangladesh. 1st Condition : If Australia will be bat first. Pick Batsmen :  In 1st condition, if Australia will bat first, there will be a lot of probability of having high scores towards Australian batsmen and very few chances of falling down wickets of Australia. So in these conditions we should select top order Australian batsmen. 2nd Condition : If Australia will bowl first. If Australia will bowl first, then we should pick more bowlers from the Australian team because in this case, the batting of Bangladesh will not stop for a long time. In this case, the chance of all out of Bangladesh will be more. So in this condition we should select more bowlers from the Australian team. You can select up to seven players from one team. But how can you select four other players? In this case, it is better to select batsmen and all rounders rather than bowlers of the Bangladesh team. Because the bowlers, Bangladesh will not be successful in taking more wickets. #Select All Rounders in your Team. According to Dream 11 rule, you have to choose at least one rounder, and more than you can choose up to 4 All rounders. Select All Rounders in your team is one of the best keys to making a Dream Team. Because they give you points in both sections ( Bowling and Batting). Think that, If they didn‚Äôt take wicket in bowling, then he had another option of batting. Maybe they give you more points from batting. Making Captain Or Vice Captain of All rounders is also a good option. #Select your Captain and Vice captain. Select your Captain and Vice captain wisely by understanding pitch condition. If you choose the captain and Vice Captain, then you become a game changer. The Captain and Vice Captain play a crucial role in our team. They work as one and a half players because the Captain gives you 2x points and the Vice Captain gives you 1.5x points. ‚Ä¢ If the pitch is helpful for bowlers, then you should select a bowler as a Captain and Vice Captain. . ‚Ä¢ If the pitch is helpful for batsmen‚Äôs , then you should select the top order batsmen as Captain and Vice Captain. ‚Ä¢ If the pitch is helpful for both ( Batsmens and Bowlers), then you should select all rounders as Captain and Vice Captain, because they give you points in both Batting and Bowling. But keep in mind all rounders should bowl his full overs such as Hardik Pandya, Ben Stokes, Maxwell, Chris Morris, James Neesham, Andre Russell,. Part time all rounders are not a good option for Captain and Vice Captain. #Renew your team 30 minutes before the match starts. One of the biggest mistakes of players is that they make their team before playing XI squad info in which they choose the players who are not even playing in the Playing XI squad. So renew your team when the Playing XI is declared. You can check the playing XI at cricbuzz. Dream 11 also shows the playing or not playing players from the symbol of green point and red point when lineups start. Make sure all your players are playing. #Keep patience ( Don‚Äôt be over rich). One of the biggest mistakes of beginners is that when they win some amount of money in starting, they think that they become a successful fantasy player. They start investing all their money in single matches. If you win some amount of money, it doesn‚Äôt mean you will win in all contests. So keep patience and invest a lower amount of money in all matches. So keep patience, avoid losing all your money. #Join low competition contests. People want to become a millionaire one day on this fantasy platform. From this inferior thinking or Greedy thinking, they start joining mega and hot contests and losing all their money. Mega contests and hot contests are high competition contests. million people‚Äôs participate in them. So winning chances of a normal person becomes very low. If you want to win more money without losing your money. You should join low competition contests. #Become a Risky. As you know, every player performs differently in different matches. Either he performs well or is either bad. So, risks are also necessary, if you have a big win dream on this fantasy platform. However, Dream 11 shows no selection percentage of players. That helps you to better understanding.",https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-trick-to-form-winning-teams-in-fantasy-dream11,,,,,

Presidential Election,Why didn't Al Gore comfortably win the 2000 U.S. Presidential election given the state of the country?,"Why didn't Al Gore win by a large margin in 2000?

1. If a candidate cannot summarize the purpose of his campaign in one sentence, he or she has no business running. Was there such a sentence for Gore? (Reagan had: cut taxes and stand up to the USSR; Clinton had: protect the middle class and establish a national health insurance program; George W. Bush had cut taxes and (ironically in retrospect) stop getting involved in nation building overseas. What was Gore's purpose other than ""the lock box""?

2. An abysmal debate performance. Possibly the worst going all the way back to JFK vs. Nixon in 1960. His loud sighing while Bush was speaking in the first debate was rude and childish. His attempt to interfere with Bush's personal space bombed completely. Would it have been so hard for Gore to say, ""Governor Bush: Today the United States enjoys peace and prosperity. Which would you change?"" but No. I was rooting for Gore, I voted for him, but I have to admit his debate performance was a nightmare.

3. A poor choice for a running mate. Joe Lieberman was a poor public speaker and an inadequate debater. It's hard to remember any area where he disagreed with Cheney. Don't belittle vice presidential debates. We all remember Lloyd Bentson's ""I knew Jack Kennedy."" We all remember Joe Biden's ""lots of malarkey."" What was Joe Lieberman's line? Nothing. Was Lieberman added to win his home state of Connecticut? Connecticut votes Democrat anyway. Was his presence to attract the Jewish vote? Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat anyway. Was Joe's adherence to Orthodox Jewish ritual and beliefs attractive to Christian fundamentalists? Perhaps, but there was no way they were going to vote for a pro-choice ticket anyway.

4. He kept Bill Clinton from campaigning for him. Cosmically stupid. Though damaged by the Monica scandal, Clinton still had pull, particularly in the South and his home state of Arkansas. Clinton didn't campaign and Gore failed to carry a single Southern state.

5. Voter exhaustion with Democrats. This might be surprising. Since the Civil War, NO retiring Democratic President was replaced with another Democrat. Truman did follow FDR and Johnson did follow Kennedy but only because the incumbent President died in office. Think about that. Since the Civil War, no Democrat was elected to replace another Democrat. This isn't true for Republicans. In the 20th century alone, Taft followed TR, Hoover followed Coolidge, and George HW Bush followed Ronald Reagan. There are various explanations. One might be that Republican is the default position and the Democratic victory is the exception.

Presidential Election,What if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election?,"I love this question. Here‚Äôs the most likely differences that jump out at me: Foreign Policy / Relations: The United States‚Äô image on the world stage would be a lot better. Whatever your thoughts on Hillary are, she‚Äôs polished and the Clintons are well-liked globally. North Korea would be running the same tests they are now, but minus the pissing contest with the US. Relations with Russia would still be rocky, but centered more around cyber espionage. Syria would be getting some finger wagging, but we still wouldn‚Äôt have hit the red line (so, no movement from under Trump there, yet). Balance of Power: Merrick Garland would have a seat on the Supreme Court; it‚Äôs unlikely that the Republicans would have held up these shenanigans while moving into a new presidency. The Republicans would have a genuine shot at a super majority in the Senate during the 2018 elections. Politics as Usual: Her approval ratings would still be suffering while probes into email servers, DNC collusion, and allegations of unjust enrichment intensified. She would shift back to a more centrist position on most non-social issues (technically, she never had the opportunity to shift more left in a tangible way, but Sanders managed to push her messaging that way). Fox and CNN (et al.) would flip roles as antagonizers and apologizers. Economy: The stock market would be lower due to a reduced optimism on the corporate friendliness of regulations and tax policy. Employment levels would, at best, stall, for similar reasons. The national deficit would be poised to grow substantially; it‚Äôs been a long time since we‚Äôve had a candidate who was historically as pro-military  and  pro-welfare programs as she was, and none of that comes for free. Misc: Trump would have a new reality TV show, and we would all be getting a good laugh out of how close we were to a President Donald J. Trump.",https://www.quora.com/What-if-Hillary-Clinton-had-won-the-2016-presidential-election,"We also wouldn't have a raging pandemic that killed over 180000 Americans.

Presidential Election,How does gerrymandering effect a presidential election?,"Only in two very rare circumstances. If the election is decided by only a handful of electoral votes, then the states partially determine their electoral vote allocations based on congressional district could hypothetically provide the marginal votes that decide the final outcome in the electoral college. To the best of my knowledge this would only be the case if the electoral college vote was dependent on the outcome of the electoral college votes of Maine, Nebraska, or both states combined (see:  Split Electoral Votes in Maine and Nebraska  for more information). If the presidential election is thrown to the House of Representatives, then gerrymandering would have certainly have an impact on the outcome. If this were to occur, the states provide a single vote based on the votes of their respective representatives - i.e., each state has one vote. In this case gerrymandering would have an impact because it would be a determining factor in who represents the states. For example, if a state voting for candidate A from party X, but the delegation to the House for that state has a majority of representatives from party Y, it may very well override its state‚Äôs popular vote and support the candidate from party Y (see:  Contingent election - Wikipedia ). As you can see these are fairly rare scenarios, so in almost every case, gerrymandering does not play a role in presidential elections.

Presidential Election,How would US presidential elections be different if there were no Electoral College?,"People have talked about how results would‚Äôve changed with a different voting system. I agree with them. Carter Moore  talked about what system the founding fathers would‚Äôve given us otherwise. I‚Äôm here to talk about the conduct of elections, assuming a popular vote system which would be first past the post. First, and foremost, ‚Äúswing states‚Äù really wouldn‚Äôt exist as a concept. So, candidates would probably visit more states, and different states too. Candidates would stop camping swing states during elections. Instead, candidates would focus on swing voters, and getting their people out to vote as a whole nation. The swing votes one election may be suburbia, but in another year, they could be urban votes. Candidates would still be traveling around the country. For example, if swing voters were suburban, a Republican might still show up in LA suburbs to swing some votes, despite not swinging CA itself Third parties would probably have a better chance. Our electoral system makes it impossible for 3rd parties to gain electoral college votes. But of course, we‚Äôd still be a first past the post nation, and 3rd parties would still struggle. But maybe Perot or Teddy‚Äôs Roosevelt might have had a better chance. Maybe moderates would do better. They‚Äôd be encouraged to appeal to the whole nation, instead of a few swing states. This could calm a few campaigns down, and make them more civil. Who knows? This is a purely hypothetical question, and we won‚Äôt know until we actually get rid of the electoral college.",https://www.quora.com/How-would-US-presidential-elections-be-different-if-there-were-no-Electoral-College,"See. I like the system of a proportional electoral college. States get to choose the president. The constitution says that, but get rid of the winner take all system. This would help smaller states still get a say, and not let states like Montana or Wyoming just be ignored completely.",,,,
Presidential Election,Why did John F. Kennedy win the 1960 Presidential election?,"The 1960 Presidential Election was extremely tight, with Kennedy only getting a 100,000 more votes in the popular vote over Nixon. Here‚Äôs some reasons how he did it:  Kennedy‚Äôs Campaign : Campaigned on the notion that the Soviet Union was getting ahead of the USA in the Cold War, both militarily and economically, and campaigned hard on making progress on the space race and closing the missile gap. The choice of LBJ as a running mate turned out to be an excellent one. He helped in a big way by carrying several Southern states, and campaigned vigorously. Debate performance. This was a key feature of the election, as never before had there been a televised presidential debate. In the first debate, 70,000,000 viewers watched Kennedy outperform Nixon. He rested before, and came across as confident and relaxed. In contrast Nixon campaigned beforehand, was injured, and came across quite sickly looking and meek which hurt is performance. Consequently, of those who watched the televised debate believed that Kennedy overwhelmingly won. Kennedy won the African-American vote by wide margins. Kennedy pleaded for Martin Luther King pleaded to President Eisenhower to pardon King, but Eisenhower refused. Following, Kennedy made many calls for his release. Consequently, Kennedy won the black vote by wide margins, which proved to be key in a number of States such as New Jersey and Illinois. Nixon‚Äôs Campaign : Eisenhower made a joke that hurt Nixon. In a televised press conference, a reporter asked for an example of a major idea of Nixon‚Äôs that was implemented. Eisenhower replied ‚ÄúIf you give me a week, I might think of one.‚Äù This statement hurt Nixon so severely that the Democrats turned the statement into a television commercial. Nixon‚Äôs running mate, Lodge, didn‚Äôt perform well. He made several mistakes, and make pledges that weren‚Äôt approved by Nixon. Some backfired and hurt their electoral chances. An injury influenced Nixon‚Äôs ability to campaign. He injured his knee on a car door and it became infected. This meant that he had to stop campaigning for some weeks, and spent time catching up on his pledge to visit all 50 states as opposed to battle ground states.",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-John-F-Kennedy-win-the-1960-Presidential-election,"Nixon also pledged to visit every single state during the campaign. I don‚Äôt know if that included Alaska and Hawaii, but visiting all of the ‚Äúlower 48‚Äù meant that he wasted time making stops in safe states instead of campaigning in swing states.","Kennedy‚Äôs popular vote margin was 118,574, but the election was decided by only 18,953 votes in 3 states ‚Äî 155 in Hawaii, 8,858 in Illinois, and 9,980 in Missouri. It was the 2nd closest ever in terms of how few voters decided the election, after 2000‚Äôs 537 votes. On the other end of the scale, Reagan‚Äôs 1984 landslide was decided by 5,947,627 voters, in 17 states.",I think Lodge was actually a good running mate. He was quite liberal and helped his performance with middle to upper-class Americans in New England and the West Coast.,"This seems like a pretty good analysis as to how and why the 1960 presidential election played out the way it did. Plus, the Republicans had held power for two terms before, and as we have seen in countless other election cycles, post-WW2 voters are very reluctant to give the party in power more than two terms in office (1988 being the only example I can think of in my lifetime).","The real reason? John Kennedy‚Äôs father, Joseph, used his influence with labor unions to buy enough votes, and he didn‚Äôt need many, to put his son in office. I was in 7th grade in 1960 when the election was held. The facts I just mentioned came out a year or so after that election."

Presidential Election,What is your comment on the first USA presidential election debate?,"Well, let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm afraid  South Park  were just granted a gargantuan boon in how much literal satire played out on that stage.  And the Internet-storming memes help break the depression as well. I know I‚Äôm British, and I probably have no right to comment, but I will do anyway. This wasn‚Äôt a debate. To call it that would be insulting to professional debates sported by mature adults. On the one hand, you have Trump. ‚ÄòNuff said. On the other hand is Biden. Hoping he would turn the tables round and come out golden was a false belief, unfortunately.  I don‚Äôt understand what Trump‚Äôs issue is. The man (being very generous there) cannot keep his mouth shut and politely listen to his opponents arguments to save his life. And Biden was not as squeaky clean as I‚Äôd have thought. He pointed out Trump‚Äôs shortcomings with regards to Covid-19, the protests against police brutality and the economy, but didn‚Äôt seem to offer up any illuminating,  practical  solutions of his own. That‚Äôs what these debates are about: for the American public (the real deciding factor at the end of the day) to get the best picture of what these presidential candidates can offer for them and their country. Both men just focused on straw-men arguments about the other and their political party. Both men also would frequently repeat select clauses in their sentences to try and re-emphasise their point when the majority of Americans aren‚Äôt 8-years-old and can understand them perfectly. Biden kept repeating that Trump was an evil-doer for letting at least 200,000 people die from a pandemic he did little in the way of  trying  to control it, however, he didn‚Äôt seem to present any viable alternatives that could swing some people‚Äôs minds in favour of him. While Trump reiterated the tired statements that Biden is a lib-tard who will undo every ‚Äúgreat‚Äù thing that he and the Republicans have done for America in the last four years. As expected, he doesn‚Äôt have good enough solutions to keep anyone outside of his stubbornly backward cult on his side because 1) he‚Äôs a compulsive liar, 2) he‚Äôs a fool and 3) he‚Äôs not a competent politician. Not to mention that  utterly  cringe-worthy ‚Äústand back and stand by‚Äù sound bite when he refused - at both Biden‚Äôs and Wallace‚Äôs direct address - to strongly denounce white supremacist cells. Did he also want to build a ‚Äúspace force‚Äù when discussing the military? Would you expect anything less? And Chris Wallace, the moderator, might as well have not been present. Not only does he have little reign of both candidates on their leashes, he also has a habit of speaking up between the candidates, robbing them both of more opportunities to  truly  stand their ground and elaborate on their ideas and opinions.  Honestly, it was a waste of time. But what really irked me was how they both made it personal. Trump going after Hunter Biden was a stupid move and Biden  responding  to those baits instead of maintaining some dignity and refusing to stoop down was even more foolish. Is this what America has come to? I genuinely hope something good comes out of this. Overall, I don‚Äôt think either candidates walked out of there undisputed and untainted in their ‚Äòvictory‚Äô. It was a farce. It most likely will have not shifted anyone‚Äôs minds who are still on the fence about voting for either man and will further embed those men‚Äôs party supporters.

But because we are Italian-Americans from the New York/New Jersey area we consider our local pizza and local Italian food to be the best.

Ibanez Series S,Are the Fender California cables good? Which other decent cables can you suggest at around the same budget?,"They‚Äôre decent cables for the price.

KIRLIN Premium Plus Cables  (Their price is more or less similar to the Fender California cable but they are of better build quality and more durable than the Fender cables. They are more resistant to noise than the Fender California cables. The only issue with this cable is they don‚Äôt have distributor network in Asia so the Indian sellers who sell them import them from retailers and that incurs heavy custom fee which drastically increases their price) Ibanez SL Series Cables  (If possible look for these cables. They cost lesser than the Fender California cables but are more durable, have better build quality and are way more resistant to noise. Of course due to their ‚Äúbuilt like tank‚Äù build quality they‚Äôre kinda heavier than the Fender California cable but it‚Äôs not a big deal. The biggest issue with this cable is availability, they‚Äôre not as readily available as the Fender California cables. In India as far as I know only Bajaao sells them.

Ibanez Series S,"What are the pros and cons of a Fender Stratocaster? I am considering buying one, and I wanted to know some info before getting one.","This question leads me to believe you‚Äôre a beginner. Seeing that anyone that‚Äôs played a while wouldn‚Äôt have to ask this question. So I‚Äôll approach the question like that. The first thing I would do is think about all your favorite bands, or even songs you really like. Then think about whether or not you particularly like the guitar in them. If you already know some of your favorite guitar players, that‚Äôs even better. Go through them, and take a look at what they‚Äôre playing. Some guitars really just fit. I found it amazing when I started paying attention. About 70% of my favorites play a Strat. The rest being around 27% Mustang or Jaguar, and the remaining 3% Gibson or something else. This can sound dumb, like buying a skateboard for the graphics or something. But I feel like a first guitar should make you feel like you‚Äôre going where you intend to go. If you feel like you‚Äôve made the right choice, then you can have comfort in knowing that you‚Äôve got the right base to achieve the sound you want. Little things like that can be important factors that increase the chances of sticking with it. Human psychology‚Ä¶ I personally play the absolute worst Squier Bullet (solid tail Strat) they ever made. My friend found it in Goodwill Outlet store for $1.99 somewhere when he was on tour. It‚Äôs the 2005 Affinity model made in Indonesia. Midnight Blue. It‚Äôs made out of plywood and has terrible electronics. But I fine tuned the neck and bridge, and it plays better than my friends 80‚Äôs American Telecaster. I love this guitar to death. And although it probably won‚Äôt ever get any collectability or street cred, I‚Äôll still upgrade everything on it and keep it forever. Squier is an excellent choice if you‚Äôre on a budget. Squier‚Äôs can be badass. The old Japanese models are super sought after. Some of the other older models are too. The Classic Vibe, or the Deluxe(?) are sometimes considered a better choice than a mexican Strat. At least Squier does have that little imaginary tie to Fender. Much better than say, an Ibanez Strat copy. But with all that in mind, you can‚Äôt go wrong with the Strat. It‚Äôs probably the most universal guitar there is. They can do anything good enough and they never look out of place on a stage. So if it really is your first guitar, I say go for it. You‚Äôll be able to find one that feels great in a color you actually want (I have like 4 favorite colors, so that way when I do upgrade, it will easier to find a good one in a color I will be content with). But once you do, find tune the neck and bridge, consider upgrading the nut and springs, and it should be a great guitar. Hopefully you fall in love with it. You‚Äôll know it if you do. Good luck.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-a-Fender-Stratocaster-I-am-considering-buying-one-and-I-wanted-to-know-some-info-before-getting-one,"Oh Norah, I just remembered!

Ibanez Series S,"Which out of Squier Classic Vibe 50's Stratocaster or Ibanez RG 450DX should I buy along with Boss Katana 50 as my first electric, so that I can play as many tones as possible i.e. both twangy (squier) and heavy djent (Ibanez) style music?","They are completely different kinds of guitars and cater to two completely different categories of guitarists. The Squier Classic Vibe 50's Stratocaster is a traditional 50's style Stratocaster with three single coil pickups and vintage style Fender tremendous. It's aimed at players who want a traditionally designed Stratocaster at a reasonable price. It's excellent for Blues, Classic Rock but it ain't ideal for high gain usage unless you replace the stock single coil pickups with single coil sized humbuckers and re-wire the whole guitar for the single coil sized humbuckers. That guitar also has vintage specification 9.5‚Ä≥ fretboard radius due to which its fretboard is actually pretty round. Due to this reason their action can't be set too low and it ain't good for playing fast leads, string bending or shredding. It's excellent for playing chords and rhythm though. It also has a very chunky neck like those old 50's Stratocaster which once again makes it extremely comfortable for playing chords and rhythms but due to that it ain't ideal for shredding. The Ibanez RG450DX on other hand is a modern Super-Strat with HSH pickup configuration. Guitars with HSH pickup configuration tend to be really versatile but the RG450DX isn't as versatile as other RG series guitars. Unfortunately unlike some higher priced RG variants the 450DX doesn't support coil splitting the bridge and neck humbuckers so you can't make it sound anywhere near to a traditional Strat unless you modify its wiring to incorporate a push pull potentiometer to split the neck and bridge humbuckers. The Quantum pickups are utterly mediocre but you can always replace them down the line so it isn't a big deal. It has a flat fretboard with a fretboard radius of 15.75‚Ä≥, due to this its action can be set really low, this makes it ideal for shredders. However guitars with such flat fretboard radius are absolutely horrible for playing chords and rhythms because they don't adhere to the curve of your fingers. They also have a very skinny neck profile which makes them great for those who play fast leads and those who shred but it can cause some discomfort if you play long rhythm sections. It's a speed vs comfort thing so make your choice wisely. I'll say get the Ibanez RG450DX and modify it down the line to have a push-pull potentiometer to split the neck and bridge humbuckers. It isn't too difficult to do, the stock Quantum humbuckers already use 4-conductor wiring so you can do the coil split mod without even replacing them. On a different note Stratocaster isn't exactly known for a twangy tone. It's the Telecaster guitars which have the twangy guitar tone. The reason it sounds twangy is because of the eddie current and effective impedance variation produced due to the ferromagnetic nature of its bridge plate around the bridge pickup. However a Telecaster isn't known for its versatility and if you put a humbucker in a Telecaster for the sake of versatility then it no more produces the signature Telecaster twang. The thing about Telecaster is that the only guitar that sounds like a Telecaster is another Telecaster. No other guitars use ferromagnetic bridge plates to mount their bridge pickups hence no other guitar has that signature Telecaster twang. (I would have recommended Cort X500, it's a way better quality guitar than RG450DX but since you require a versatile guitar so it ain't suitable for you. It has EMG 81 and 85 pickup set which although are great for high gain usage but they are not even distantly versatile by any means. Cort stupidly ruined an otherwise excellent guitar by putting those EMG 81 and 85 pickup set in it. Replacing active pickups is a pricey affair so it's not like you can swap them easily either. If they would have used Fishman Fluence active humbuckers or even just a pair of passive humbuckers from Seymour Duncan or DiMarzio then things would have been way different. However by putting EMG 81 and 85 set in that guitar Cort basically took all versatility from that guitar and flushed it down the shitter)",https://www.quora.com/Which-out-of-Squier-Classic-Vibe-50s-Stratocaster-or-Ibanez-RG-450DX-should-I-buy-along-with-Boss-Katana-50-as-my-first-electric-so-that-I-can-play-as-many-tones-as-possible-i-e-both-twangy-squier-and-heavy-djent,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,What modifications have you made to your guitar(s) to make them more versatile?,"I‚Äôll date myself here. My first mod was building a PIAA Clarifier pre amp from Plans Craig Anderton posted in his Guitar Player Magazine column about 1980‚Äì81. It was a active preamp that would run on 9‚Äì18 volts and small enough to fit into a guitar. You sent away mail order and got back a kit with a PCB board and resisters and capacitors and a Op Amp. TL072 as I recall. The old timers will probably recall what I‚Äôm talking about and everyone else will be‚Ä¶.Huh? ;). But you got +/- 15 dB Bass and Treble controls and a significant amount of output gain. I‚Äôm thinking 30db or so. Basically you turned your passive pickups into active pickups. It worked as a low impedance line driver and you could plug into a amp or mixing board or console without loading the pickups. That and the guitar are long gone. In the day though that was high tech ;) Other things I‚Äôve done is to disassemble regular Humbuckers and convert them from two conductor to four conductor in order to play with switching schemes. I‚Äôve added push pull pots for adding the neck pickup to the bridge pickup on a Strat for a more Tele tone. Added coil splitting or series/parallel switch‚Äôs to guitars. I find extra switches fussy and prefer push pull pots over drilling holes and adding mini toggles. If you have a Strat or Tele you can add a 5 way Super Switch or in the case of a Tele a 4 way switch that will give you the options of series or parallel when using both pickups. The Super Switch on a Strat will let you do fun things like switch coils in and out on HH, HSH and HSS Strats. Combine them in series or parallel. It‚Äôs easy and intuitive. I first saw this on Ibanez RG guitars back in the day. It‚Äôs nice to keep things simple. I added a bridge Humbucker to a Strat way back when that required routing your guitar. Vibrato stability is not a versatility feature but not being able to use due to tuning issues it takes away from your guitar. Locking tuners and a Graphtech nut can help here immensely. I‚Äôve had a Les Paul with a Floyd Rose added. That adds a lot of versatility to a LP. I‚Äôve added pickups to acoustic guitars which gives one the ability to amplify it. That‚Äôs more versatile. Changing pickups is generally a ‚ÄúTone‚Äù enhancement but the right set might open up new genres for you. Pickups will change the tone of a guitar. Often for the better. Pickup switching systems like I mentioned above add some versatility but won‚Äôt make a turd sound great regardless of where you set them. They will not improve tone. In my opinion. They just give some added options.",https://www.quora.com/What-modifications-have-you-made-to-your-guitar-s-to-make-them-more-versatile,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What is the easiest musical instrument to learn as an adult, given that I have zero knowledge of music?","I have tried over 15 instruments. I have some suggestions for you, but first, I must point out that the only really easy instrument to play is the kazoo. Anything else is going to take serious practice. One more thing before I go any further: I have not been paid to endorse any brand or product. My preferences for particular brands and instruments are based on experience, but also on personal taste, so take that into consideration. This answer is long, so if you just want a very short answer, I recommend starting with a tinwhistle (also called pennywhistle) in the key of D, which will be listed on the label of the packaging, a harmonica (one that costs at least $25), or a mostly unknown but fun stringed instrument called the Seagull Merlin. And, if you like blues, go for a cigar box guitar (CBG). One other instrument that is not to hard to learn the basics of, at least, is the bass guitar. I‚Äôve written about the first three at the beginning of the post, and CBG and bass a little later. I‚Äôve also written about instruments, such as guitar, ukulele and piano, that are less easy, but still popular choices for those entering the world of musical instruments and how to play them. Tinwhistle - also called a penny whistle. High pitched, shrill even at times, but can sound awesome. I learned from a teacher who taught a group class, but there are tons of tutorials on youtube, and you only need to learn a tiny bit of music theory, or none at all. An ok tinwhistle will likely set you back $20 or less. Get one in the key of D. Two brands that are the most well-known: Generation and Feadog. I don‚Äôt recommend getting a Clarke whistle. Those are made a bit differently than the rest, and are more uncomfortable to hold as you play. One of the best whistle people on youtube is a Catholic priest. If you are on youtube and type in ‚Äúpenny whistle priest,‚Äù you might find him. Tinwhistles are mostly used to play Celtic music and other traditional tunes from Ireland and the UK. Harmonica - depending on where you live, you will likely find at least some tutorial books at your library. Also, lots of youtube videos. I would strongly suggest NOT buying a cheap harmonica. Spend at least $25‚Äì30, and buy one in the key of C, as most educational materials and videos are for harps (harmonicas) in the key of C. A few models to consider: Hohner Special 20, Seydel Blues Session Standard, and Suzuki Harpmaster. These all have plastic combs (the middle piece) instead of wood, which can swell, and are fairly comfortable to play. The Seydel is a little wider than the other two. The Special 20 is by far the best selling of the three. But I mostly play the Harpmaster, and sometimes the Seydel. I like the tone a little more. The Lee Oscar Major Diatonic in key of C is also a classic. Avoid the Hohner Blues Harp - some people love this one, but I think it is the most uncomfortable to play. I‚Äôve found good deals on eBay.. but shop around on that site, as prices vary. A little-known instrument called the Seagull Merlin. See youtube for demos and songs. The Merlin is based on the Appalachian dulcimer - also called a Mountain dulcimer - but unlike those instruments, the Merlin can be played like a guitar, and has fewer frets than a dulcimer. The tone of the Merlin is excellent, and it‚Äôs practically impossible to hit a wrong note. The best Merlin teacher I‚Äôve found on youtube - his channel is called ‚ÄúRyan‚Äôs Seagull M4 Lessons.‚Äù Merlins cost about $120, last time I checked. I ordered mine from Elderly Instruments online, just over 2 years ago. You can get Merlins from many vendors though, and some music stores carry them. Almost no Merlin instructional materials are available other than youtube videos. These instruments come with either a mahogany or spruce top. I like the spruce top, because the sound is a bit brighter and punchy than the mahogany top. Get one in the key of D to start out with, since most tutorials will feature Merlins in the key of D (key of G also available). The problem with tinwhistles, harmonicas, and the Merlin is that, unlike a piano, guitar, and so many other instruments, you will not have access to all notes needed to play all songs. Experienced whistle players travel with a bag of whistles in different keys, and harmonica players carry cases with many different harmonicas - this is so they can jam with guitarists and etc. Merlins only have a few frets, as compared to guitars, ukes, etc. - more frets means more notes. And they are only sold in the key of D and G, so far. Music is based around keys - sets of notes - scales and chords to go with each key. If you have an instrument, such as a whistle or harmonica, that can be played in only two keys (only one key will be listed on the box or packaging material), then you will need more of these instruments, tuned in other keys if you want to play with other musicians. Eventually, buying a bunch of whistles or harmonicas in different keys can be quite costly. But only if you become quite proficient, and jam with other people. You won‚Äôt have this problem with pianos, guitars, etc. because you‚Äôll have access to notes in all keys. Another fun instrument is the cigar box guitar - especially if you are into blues. Almost no songbooks available, but lots of tutorials on youtube. You can find lots of these instruments on eBay, and I think there is at least one builder on Etsy. I like a CBG builder on eBay, called Weeklyhouse. Good prices and good workmanship. Bidding usually starts at $65 plus I‚Äôm not sure how much shipping.. $30 at most, if I remember - but this depends on where you live. Weeklyhouse‚Äôs listings include a demo video of each instrument. Some internet browsers won‚Äôt show the video though. I had that problem last night, when I was using a different computer than the one I‚Äôm on now. It‚Äôs great to hear the instrument before buying. Maybe other eBay vendors are doing this now too, but I don‚Äôt know. I have already bought two from this vendor, a 3 string and a 4 string, and am thinking of getting another 4 string. 3 string CBG‚Äôs are by far the most common, and are a little easier to play than 4 stringed CBG‚Äôs . They sound cool, but I like 4 string CBG‚Äôs better. I like playing finger-style guitar, and this works better with a 4 string CBG. The 4 strings have a fuller sound. But, you are more likely to find 3 string tutorials on youtube. Get a coricidin-type bottle sampler on eBay from blooze bottles. This is a sampler of bottle slides of different sizes. It‚Äôs possible to have a strap button put on the back of your CBG, on the back of the neck or box, and use a strap adapter or shoelace to attach the strap to the front (headstock) of the instrument. I had the strap button put on at a music store by a guitar tech, since I do not know how to use power tools. Some CBG‚Äôs are built with the strings so high off the fretboard that it is only possible to play these while using a slide. Other builders have the strings low enough so you can play the instrument using your fingers to fret the notes. If you find one online that you like, ask the builder (if possible) how low the action (string height) is, and whether or not you can play with your fingers as well as a slide. I only like CBG‚Äôs that have strings low enough to be played either way. Some CBG‚Äôs are acoustic-electric - meaning you can plug them into an amp. This is fun, even if the electronics on some CBG‚Äôs are rather cheap. They might pick up extra noise, compared to a regular guitar pickup, but at least you can plug the instrument into an amp, and dirty up the sound. It is possible to get CBG‚Äôs with no electronics, and also possible to get them with regular guitar electronics built in. The ones with standard guitar pickups (electronics) will likely cost more than those without such pickups. You will find a large price range on these instruments, since they are all handmade. I think, if you want to learn songs, the Merlin is a better choice than a CBG. If, however, you are really into blues, and just want to figure out blues tunes.. and ones you make up on your own, then a CBG is fun. If you don‚Äôt want to bother with notes at all, hand drums can be enjoyable. Get a djembe. If you don‚Äôt mind a heavy one, and one that has a drum head of made real goat skin, buy a djembe from Overseas Connection. These are still made in Africa, as far as I know. You can find them online, and in some music stores. They sound great. If you want a djembe with a synthetic drum head, Remo is the only brand I know of that makes these. The others, even if they are made in factories in Asia, will likely still have animal skin drum heads. Toca and Meinl are pretty good brands. Congas are great too, but less portable, and more expensive. Lots of lessons on youtube. Being part of a drum circle can be quite enjoyable. I was in one back in 2009. Lots of fun. You‚Äôll just need to be patient with yourself as you learn basic rhythms, There is a hand drum that looks like a wooden box, and is called a cajon. To play it, you sit on it, lean over, and beat on the vertical surface of the drum, which is between your knees. You can get low pitched tones and snare sounds. Not so easy on the back though. Meninl makes a slap-top cajon that has a horizontal surface. The snare tone of it is on the left, a mid-tone on the right, and bass tone in the middle. I‚Äôve owned two of these. I can play them comfortably on my lap, or put them on a table and bash away. Ukulele.. you might want to consider the ukulele - but if so, I caution you.. the ukulele is not nearly as easy as I expected it would be. Some of the chords are very easy, and some are surprisingly difficult - even tougher than some guitar chords. Plus - narrower fret spacing than on a guitar, so you will be squeezing your fingers into smaller spaces on the fretboard than you would on a guitar. My fingers kept cramping up, but I was playing some really challenging chords. Also, the uke has odd tuning (called reentrant tuning) compared to most stringed instruments. The string you‚Äôd expect to have the lowest sound doesn‚Äôt. This makes learning the uke a bit tricky, especially for folks who already know how to play a guitar. It‚Äôs possible to replace the oddly high-pitched string with one that is the same note, but lower in pitch, but most books and other tutorials are meant for standard reentrant tuning. If you are just strumming chords, this will not be an issue, but it will be if you plan on learning music theory on ukulele, or playing finger-style - playing individual strings and notes. With ukulele, as well as guitar - you have access to all the notes, scales, etc. and can play tons of different songs in many different keys. You can‚Äôt do that with the other instruments I mentioned, unless you buy more of those in different keys. Bass guitar.. if you just want to learn songs, you can do that without learning music theory. Just do what so many guitarists do- learn to read tablature - it‚Äôs a lot easier to read than standard notation. The basics of bass are not very difficult. Only 4 strings vs. a guitar‚Äôs 6, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about playing chords. The downside to bass.. you won‚Äôt sound good playing by yourself. You‚Äôll want to be part of a band. Some other things to consider regarding bass.. Once you get good and start playing gigs, you will need a large, heavy bass amp - much bigger and heavier than guitarists carry. And lastly, many bass guitars are heavy enough to be uncomfortable for some musicians. You don‚Äôt have to spend a lot of coin to get a decent starter bass. $200‚Äì300 will be fine. My top bass recommendation is the Ibanez GSR-200. The newer ones require a 9V battery to be put in the back in a special compartment. Once the battery is out of juice, you will not get any sound from the instrument, until you change the battery. Some used models (quite common online and in some music stores that sell used gear) do not require a battery. These GSR-200‚Äôs have 3 knobs, instead of 4. Basses that don‚Äôt require a battery are called ‚Äúpassive‚Äù basses, and those that do are called ‚Äúactive.‚Äù I think the passive ones sound better. Squier - the cheap brand of Fender, has some good, inexpensive models, but these are somewhat heavier. Other good starter basses are made by Yamaha and Gretsch. I recommend a 3‚Ä≥ wide leather strap to support the weight. Levy‚Äôs is a good brand, but I like the Franklin glove leather 3‚Ä≥ strap best. Not cheap - but worth it. Start out with a small Fender Rumble amp.- the Rumble 25, costs $100, and some vendors offer free shipping. If you want more tone options, and don‚Äôt mind a larger amp that costs $100 more, go for the Rumble 40. The Fender Rumble amps are surprisingly light. There are even a couple large enough and loud enough to use with a band. Ampeg is also pretty good - a classic brand, in fact, but heavier, and less tonal, sound-shaping options than the Rumble. Avoid Acoustic, the house brand of Guitar Center. I love shopping at GC, but do NOT like their line of bass and electric guitar amps. What brand of cable to buy? Most that are sold in a package or on a rack and have a brand name (and are not in a bin) are good enough to start out with. I like D‚Äôaddario/Planet Waves - good cable for the money. You won‚Äôt need very expensive cables if you are just starting out. Buy a $100 cable if you turn pro. What length of cable to get? Even when just practicing in my room, I liked having a 20 ft. cable, so I could wander around my room as I practiced. This is a good length. I used to have a shorter cable, 10 ft., I think. I had to stand close to my amp the whole time I played. Not fun. My favorite youtube channel for bass is called Scott‚Äôs Bass Lessons. One great series of learning materials for both guitar and bass is the Play-A-Long series - tablature books and a CD Rom that you can use to play along with, and slow down the tempo of the song. I‚Äôm guessing these are still being published. They are definitely useful when learning songs. I think there is one called ‚Äúeasy bass guitar,‚Äù or something like that. If you like The Police (Sting‚Äôs former band), the Police play along book is also good, since many Police bass lines are simple. Guitar.. You might want to try a guitar. You might not find guitar to be that hard. Some people do, and some don‚Äôt. I still dabble on guitar, but after many years, still cannot play it well - you might really take to it though. I‚Äôd say start out on an acoustic steel string guitar and learn the basics - chords and so forth. Your fingers will hurt for awhile, but you will build calluses and then your fingers will not hurt. Some good brands for beginners: Yamaha, Ibanez and Seagull. You can get a good starter guitar, either steel string or classical, for under $300. I personally prefer playing a classical acoustic with nylon strings, instead of steel string acoustic. I prefer the sound and also like that the nylon strings are easier on my fingers than steel strings. I‚Äôve played steel string acoustics and electric guitars in the past, but like the classical guitar best. Yamaha classical guitars are good. You might also want to try Ibanez or Cordoba. You can start out on an electric guitar if you want, but then you have to deal with choosing from a multitude of amps with various features, and will likely get quite distracted by the myriad of sound options and effects most amps, even small practice amps, are equipped with these days. If you decide to go electric, I recommend Epiphone. Their cheapest models seem better built than some of the cheap models by other brands. Ibanez makes pretty good cheap guitars too, and so does Yamaha and Schecter. Stay away from any Squier electric guitar models that have the Squier logo only in black, and not in gold - the logo on the headstock. The ones with the logo in black are not good. Unfortunately, the standard Squier models are a lot more expensive than they used to be. But, you get what you pay for. A standard Squier Strat or telecaster should make you happy. Some electric guitars have two sets of double pickups on them called humbuckers (you will find these on Ephiphone, Schecter, Ibanez, and other models). Most Squier and Fender guitars have single coil pickups, which have a thinner sound, and can produce more unwanted noise. But some people love these guitars. Some Squier Strats come with one humbucker and two single coils - a good combination. This is true of Ibanez as well. Electric guitar amps.. best practice amp, in my opinion, is the Fender Mustang (these come in different sizes. You‚Äôll just need a small one). Line 6 is also pretty good. If you want one with less effects that is built reasonably well, then go for a Marshall practice amp, or Orange (that‚Äôs a brand, not just a color). Blackstar has some little amps that also sound great - but with these, there are less knobs than most, so to change some of the sounds, you will have to plug one into a computer via USB cable, and use the Blackstar website. Mandolins sound good, but they are kind of like ukuleles in that the necks are short and narrow, making chords hard to play. Also, mandolins have 8 strings - you‚Äôll be playing two strings at once instead of one. This takes more finger strength. Not the easiest instrument to learn, but they sure do sound great. If you really want to study music theory, then learning piano is best. At least with piano, the note you see on the sheet music can only be played with one key, either a black or white key on the piano. On a guitar, and other stringed instruments, the note on the page can be played on several different locations on the fretboard, and it is the same note. But, you are asking about an easy instrument to learn. I don‚Äôt play piano well, as of yet, but so far, I can tell you that compared to some other instruments I‚Äôve mentioned, playing piano is not easy. It is very challenging, especially at first to have the left hand doing something different than the right hand. I have found playing chords on a piano to be easier than playing chords on guitar or ukulele, but unlike on these stringed instruments, while playing piano, your left hand will be playing some notes, and your right hand will be playing others. Left hand more for rhythm, right hand more for melody (not always, of course). It is very tough to have your hands doing two different things, such as playing chords with your left hand and single notes with your right. On a guitar, your right hand and left hand will be teaming up to play the same notes/chords, even though one hand is picking the strings, and the other s fretting them. Lastly, with piano, if you really get into reading sheet music, you will have to learn both the treble clef and bass clef, and read both of these at once. For other instruments, like guitar and most wind instruments (trumpet, sax, clarinet, etc.) you‚Äôll just be playing one note at a time, and will just be using the treble clef. That‚Äôs better than reading both clefs at once. It is certainly possible to learn piano without learning both clefs. There is a dude called Scott the Piano guy, who has books on this. And you‚Äôll probably find videos on youtube that show you how to play using simplified sheet music called a lead sheet (there are books, called ‚Äúfake books,‚Äù that are full of lead sheets. Tons of songs). A lead sheet will have a melody line in the treble clef, (bass clef will not be on the page) and letters above the notes that signify what chord to play. This form of sheet music is MUCH easier to read than standard notation. But you need to know what you are doing, and still need to learn lots of chords to play with your left hand. And of course, you will need to learn the treble clef well, so you can play those notes with your right hand. One last thing regarding learning how to read and write music.. many of the greats, such as Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen, never learned how to read or write music. According to an excerpt of a John Lennon interview I read a few nights ago here on this site, even the guys in The Beatles started out without being musically literate. It isn‚Äôt necessary for playing popular music. If you want to learn to play classical music, then yeah, you REALLY need to know your music theory. And, if you want to learn jazz, knowing theory is really going to help. Regarding wind instruments - the only one I played for awhile was clarinet. On both clarinet and sax, there is something called an octave key - this raises up all the notes so that they are the same, but higher in pitch. Unfortunately, the octave key doesn‚Äôt raise the notes on the clarinet only an octave higher, but more than an octave, so you will have to know two notes for each little key you play on the clarinet. Otherwise, the clarinet is not a terribly hard instrument. But you‚Äôll not likely be playing one unless you are part of a school band program, like classical music, or New Orleans style early jazz. I tried saxophones and a trumpet, briefly, but didn‚Äôt have money for lessons at the time, so I can‚Äôt weigh in on which is easier. To play a lot of notes on sax, you will need to learn what notes go with what keys on the instrument. The trumpet only has three buttons on it - three keys - to play lots of notes, you will need to change your breath, and position of your mouth on the mouthpiece. I would call neither of these instruments, nor the clarinet, easy. Ok, so.. tinwhistle, harmonica, and Merlin are the easiest, and it‚Äôs not too hard to get started on bass guitar. Cigar box guitar is fun if you really like old style blues and don‚Äôt mind not being able to learn a ton of cover songs. Hand drums are great. If you want more of a challenge, you might want to give ukulele, guitar, or piano a try. Regardless of what instrument you start on, you will need to get yourself a metronome - preferably either a small digital one, or, even better, a metronome app on your phone - so you know you are practicing in time. Very important. I know, at first especially, it really sucks to be practicing with a metronome, but you better do it if you want to play songs well, and especially if you want to eventually jam with other musicians.

Tricking,What are the greatest magic tricks of all times?,"As Jeff says, magic tricks are revealed (and forgotten) all the time.  The question also leads to a more complicated question: what constitutes ""revealed""? Despite the ""never reveal your secrets"" motto, most magicians reveal their own inventions to others. To whom? Well, to their wife or husband, perhaps, and certainly to their assistant(s), but more crucially,  to other magicians.  Sharing it with other magicians is a valuable tool in improving their effect, because often there are better ways which may not occur to the inventor, techniques they didn't know or think about.  Magicians take their tricks and publish them in books, magazines, e-books. They produce DVDs and videos explaining how to do them. This is all a form of exposure, but it's considered okay because they're sharing them with people who share an active interest in the craft. Great magic tricks are usually evolutionary, not revolutionary. Someone came up with a great idea. Then somebody else improved it. (Often, there are variations that do NOT improve, but merely change, trading one limitation for another.) And another and another. So many tricks that you see are actually collaborations with other magicians, some of whom may've died long ago.  But let's say you're not talking about revealing tricks to other magicians, but to the general public. Again, this occurs constantly. Magicians sometimes make mistakes. A good performer can usually cover the mistake in such a way that the audience does not really learn anything; in fact, in mentalism performances, mistakes can add to the performer's credibility -- after all, the thought goes, if someone could really read minds and so on, it's doubtful they could do it perfectly all the time. A famous mentalist once said that he intentionally gets things wrong about 15% of the time. (Usually, this means getting something wrong on purpose! Any mentalist who screws up 15% of the time needs a lot more rehearsal.)
 Let's go one step further and say that you're not talking about a passing bit of exposure during a magic show, but something larger-scale.  I would say, then, that the greatest aspect of magic ever exposed was the use of the thumb tip, in a show that Penn and Teller used to put on. It's a spectacularly useful prop (not just a trick, it's considered probably the most useful ""utility device"" in magic). And although they exposed it over and over, in hundreds of live shows and, I think, on TV as well, it is -- hearkening back to Jeff's answer again -- forgotten. You can still get up in front of anyone who saw Penn and Teller expose the thumb tip and fool them completely and utterly with it. ",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-greatest-magic-tricks-of-all-times,"I got to sit in on one of those performances in NYC.

Tricking,"What is an easy to learn, yet impressive magic card trick?","I feel that most of the other answers are far too complicated and technical to qualify as ""easy to learn.""  They are excellent tricks, but take a lot of effort. This trick requires no sleights, mathematics, or gimmicks. It happens almost entirely in the spectator's hands. I often demonstrate it several times in a row to the same spectator, or to different spectators numerous times in front of the same audience, and nobody ever catches on. To the best of my recollection I learned this trick from one of Bob Longe's excellent books. EFFECT: The magician hands the spectator an ordinary deck of cards that they may inspect and shuffle freely (in fact they are encouraged to shuffle as much as possible to increase the impact of the climax). The magician then fans the deck to show that it is thoroughly mixed and sets it face down in front of the spectator.  The spectator is instructed to cut the deck wherever they like and place the cut-off portion on the table, then mark where they cut by placing the formerly bottom portion on top of the cut-off portion  perpendicular   (this is important), explaining  that it is ""to mark the spot where you cut the deck ."" The magician takes a moment to review that the deck is an ordinary deck and the spectator freely shuffled and cut the deck with their own hands as much as they wanted, then predicts the two cards that the spectator cut between. Allow a moment for people to react to your claim and to build suspense. Lift the now top portion (which was placed perpendicular ""to mark where you cut it"") from the deck to show its bottom card, then turn over the top card of the bottom portion of the deck to reveal both predictions were correct. METHOD:  After the spectator shuffles, the magician fans the deck to show how well mixed the cards are. When the cards are visible, discretely memorize the top and bottom cards of the deck. These are your prediction cards. When the spectator completes the cut he doesn't realize that ""marking the spot where he cut to"" is  not  marking the spot he cut to; he is marking the former top and bottom cards of the deck. TIPS:  Spend a lot of time talking about how freely he may choose to cut off a lot of cards or a few, then he completes the cut perpendicularly ""to mark where you cut"", and move right into reviewing all the reasons you couldn't have influenced the outcome of the shuffle or cut. Then announce your prediction.  Taking time to let the spectator lose track of  which thing was where  is called Temporal Misdirection or Time Misdirection: make sure your review of the events of the trick takes several moments before announcing that you have a prediction. The right patter also uses this time to build suspense and make the trick seem as impressive as possible; afterward spectators are more likely to remember the trick  as you told them it happened , rather than as it actually happened. For maximum effectiveness, do not tell them it's a prediction trick until you are ready to announce your prediction. When they beg you to do it again (and they will), they will go into it the second time  already believing  that you can predict the outcome. Sometimes on the second performance I pretend to explain how the trick is done by telling them that when I fan the deck to show the mix of the cards, I'm secretly memorizing the location of every card in the deck. If this explanation sounds complicated, sit down with a deck of cards and try it a few times. The first few times I tried this as a kid, I could barely figure out what was happening in my own hands! You can also claim to predict only one of the cards if that suits the purpose of the routine, such as having the spectator cut to ""their"" card in the ambitious card routine. I've won bar bets with this trick, gotten laid with this trick, and convinced people that I'm a mathematical savant with this and a few other clever deceptions.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-easy-to-learn-yet-impressive-magic-card-trick,"This really is an excellent and simple method.

Tricking,What are some must-know tricks of your trade that most people are oblivious to? Are there any pieces of knowledge from your industry or experience that could help everyone if they knew it?,"Language teacher, and erstwhile language learner. I teach English in Japan, lately with increasing success, and I speak & write Japanese. My trick for learning foreign languages is.... The Sid Caesar method: If you learn to impersonate languages and you will also learn how to speak them. Please give this time, and try the experiment.  Gradually it seemed to me that the biggest difficulty with learning a foreign language is not making meaning but the fear of the lack of it.  What do I mean?! The story goes like this. When I learnt to speak Japanese after studying it for about 4 years I also found myself able to speak and read French. I had never been good at French at school, but something in my head, my psychological attitude to language had  changed. I am not saying I am good at French but suddenly I had no problem with blabbing in my bad French. For a long time I did not work out what had changed. Then two things happened: 1) I came across some research by Steven Heine, extending ""terror management theory"" arguing that there is not thing more scary than the absence of meaning. You can download his paper here  Page on Psych 2) I came across some comedians that ""impersonate languages"" such as the  great Sid Caesar, and I thought ""That's it. That is what changed.""
Here is Sid Caesar impersonating French and other languages.

When I was young I had a black friend who (though he is as English as I am) when treated with prejudice in a public place used to reply in his impersonation of an African language. At the time even the thought of impersonating a language filled me with dread. But now I hardly break into a sweat. I am not as good as Sid Caesar in the above video but speaking in gobbledygook no longer hurts. I will append my video at the end.  Many people (especially in Japan) think that foreign languages are very difficult, and that you need to know a lot of grammar and vocabulary. At the same time, many native speakers (especially children) use a small vocabulary and the grammar they use could be written on a postcard. In other words the intellectual, structural, and factual information required of being able to speak like a child in a foreign language is the sort of thing you can learn in a couple of days.  This fact has been known in the language teaching community for some time, and leads to an emphasis upon ""acquisition"" of language through practice, rather than learning of language (e.g. rote memorisation of grammar and vocab). But even using Krashen or other acquisition / communication centred techniques, progress is slow. What is the reason for this? One reason is that practice is required, just as it is required in another other skill, such as tennis. You don't become a good tennis player just by learning tennis theory.  But there is another aspect that is peculiar to language. To an extent we live in language, we narrative our selves in it, and when the language lacks meaning it results in a loss of self that is almost as scary as death (see Heine's research above). When we go to speak a foreign language, and let roll with a sentence that may well be all wrong, and may meet with a complete lack of comprehension, we enter that world of unmeaning and experience something akin to death. And this is terrifying.  However, of course, we do not die and we gradually learn not to be scared.  There is quicker route. If you practice impersonating languages, such as by watching a YouTube video of an Italian interview and then practice speaking in fake Italian mimicry (like Sid Caesar above) then you can, gradually, overcome this fear of flying into unmeaning. I am not saying that you will suddenly become a polyglot, but it will make foreign languages easier.  At the least you will become aware of one of the biggest, I would say the biggest, obstacles to foreign language proficiency.  The experiment.  1) Time yourself for a minute. Try and say as much as you can in the foreign language of you are trying to learn.
2) Then watch a video on YouTube of a language that you know nothing about and try impersonating that language for one minute. Do not worry about the quality of your impersonation, just try and make various word like sounds. (You can find some Chinese by searching for ""ÁôºÊòé"" or some Italian, I think, by searching for ""intervista"") In which case did you make more sound? I am guessing that you made more sounds in case (1) even though you had to use correct grammar, correct vocabulary. In case (2) you could have made any old noise.  In other words, it is not the words, the meaning, the grammar that is difficult, but the un-meaning that is the biggest, terrifying obstacle to foreign language acquisition.  If you can already ""do a Sid Caesar"" then I predict you will be quick at learning foreign languages or already can speak one.  Here is me impersonating Chinese. It is not good and makes me cringe a bit still but in times past the mere thought was quite beyond the pale (i.e. s*** scary).  Here is the link to my video of me Impersonating Three Languages.  (Quora, only allows one video?)

Interesting you should mention Sid Caesar. According to Steve Martin in his autobiography (I believe it was Martin) Sid Caesar's mother had all of her friends watch her son's show. The next day the mother called her son and told him how proud she was because her friends were so impressed with the fact that Sid could speak fluent German. When Sid told his mother that he was just faking and couldn't speak German his mother whispered, ""Well, my friends don't have to know that.""","A related observation. When travelling in Thailand, I found that I was much better understood when I read from my Thai-English dictionary affecting an exaggerated Thai accent than when I read from the dictionary as if it were English. My accent was atrocious and my friends fell into hysterics every time I asked for directions, but I rarely had trouble being understood. I never connected that experience to the learning of languages until reading your answer! I remember when I was learning French the most frustrating experience was when I would say something, in French, to a French friend, and he would look at me blankly: ""what did you say?"", he'd reply in English.  A little more imitation would have made learning French a lot less frustrating I think.",Your video appears to be just a photo. Looking forward to hear it!,"This is so true. From experience I learned some French in high school in the ordinary way, (memorising vocabulary, grammar rules, etc.). At the end of the year, I could write one-page essays without difficulty and with some confidence. But I would never attempt to speak it! It sounded quite similar to English (considering my first language is Arabic), and until the end of the year, I pronounced almost every word, including the alphabet, in English!
Now, I rarely mention that I know French. When I hear it I understand it, but I probably won't ever speak it. I feel bad about it because I spent so much time and effort on it. I was thinking of learning Duetsch, and I'll try this approach. It doesn't matter to sound perfect, but at least if I 'know' a language, I guess should be able to say something in it...","Well, that is quite enlightening. Now I know why there is a particular language which I know quite well but don't speak in almost at all - fear of doing it wrong caused by mental pressure. Thank you for making me aware where that mental block came from."
Presidential Election,"Is Mitt Romney's analysis of why he lost the presidential election to President Obama correct? If not, why did he lose the election to President Obama?","Of course,  Joshua Engel  already pointed out that it's horseshit, which is both good and a good enough answer to the question. I'm going to try to answer the meta-question. The very idea that there needs to be a special explanation presupposes that it should be normal for Mitt Romney to win. This in turn presupposes that an automatic win for people like Romney with lots of money should be expected, from God or the laws of mathematics or something, so that some other outcome needs a particular explanation. That expectation is the real reason that Romney lost. ETA: Been thinking about this more.  (Moved analogy to comments.) Romney's analysis seems to me to be based on two unstated assumptions, both of which come from his culture (his culture being a big part of why he lost the election):  quid pro quo  and groupthink. So, as an example, he asserts that The Latinos‚Ñ¢ voted for Obama, because Obama gave gifts to The Latinos‚Ñ¢. The  quid pro quo  part is sort of understandable, because he's a businessman and was talking to a bunch of fundraisers.  It is somewhat notable because it demonstrates that there isn't even a pretense that campaign funding is for free speech.  That sure became transparent fast!  Still, it's somewhat expected. The groupthink part is to me more interesting.  I've heard a lot of talk radio (not much else to listen to in the car in Atlanta) talking about the idea that Republicans to get The Latino Vote‚Ñ¢ or The Black Vote‚Ñ¢ or The Women's Vote‚Ñ¢ or The Gay Vote‚Ñ¢.  It's all about groups. The thing is, though, that the Republicans at least enhanced and may have even created the group identification in the first place.  Romney came up with the 47%.  It's very important to right-wing radio that Obama's middle name is Hussein.  Just before the election, I heard one of those clowns say, ""I can't see any reason to vote for Obama, and don't say because he's black.""  The Republicans have worked very hard to divide people into groups to say who is a Real American‚Ñ¢ and who is not.  That has been their entire strategy. It isn't simply that the Republican demographic is getting old and dying.  The very demographics are dying.  All those categories that people have relied upon since the 1950s (well, with Latino and Gay since the late 1970s) are falling apart.  This isn't just going to affect Republicans.

Presidential Election,"What do you think will be the dominant, defining issue of the 2020 US presidential election?","Thanks for the A2A, John The defining, dominant issue of the 2020 US Presidential election is going to be Donald John Trump. I was going to add a caveat about that being true if he didn‚Äôt die of natural causes between now and then. But I realized that while he will do a much better job manipulating the media if he is alive, even if he were to keel over tomorrow, the effect he has had on the Republican Party is so profound that 2020 will just become a referendum on his legacy, rather than his future. The Donald is a master of media manipulation - Memorial Day? All about him. Rosanne Barr? All about him. The FBI? All about him. North Korea? All about him. Regardless of what policy matters are brought up, by Democrats or Republicans, if they don‚Äôt tie those issues to the Donald‚Äôs character, he will just do it for them. The Donald‚Äôs rise has also turbocharged the direction the GOP has been moving in since Reagan - alienating minorities and women while consolidating support among white men, pushing away college graduates and post-graduates while gaining ground among those with a high school or less education, gaining favor with older voters and losing it with younger ones. With or without the actual Donald, the future of the GOP is all going to be about whether the Republicans will - or even can - continue on the path that gave us Trumpism in the first place. The Donald is sui generis  personally , but as a matter of  governance  he continues to embrace the fundamental instability of the modern Republican coalition - a largely religious and social conservative base, bent to the service of a movement conservative (i.e. laissez-faire capitalist) agenda. From Reagan to Trump, what‚Äôs squared this circle is mostly a focus on anti-abortion and anti-LGBT social policies. The Donald simply out-bid the rest of the 2016 Republican field with a full-on appeal to white nationalism. Can Party grandees put that sentiment back in the box? Will the Republican Party continue to drift towards white nationalism? Either way, 2020 provides some answers, and it‚Äôs all a referndum on what Donald Trump has done. Democrats might - or might not - come up with a better message than ‚Äúvote for us, we suck less than this guy‚Äù but regardless, he‚Äôll still be setting the tune. Original question: What do you think will be the dominant, defining issue of the 2020 US presidential election?",https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-dominant-defining-issue-of-the-2020-US-presidential-election,Feely ‚Ä¶. you need to look at some polls and see just what groups support Trump.

Presidential Election,Who would be the most likely Democrat and Republican candidates for the 2016 presidential elections?,"On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton is the clear front runner if she chooses to run.  (My own feelings are that she will not, but I was wrong about her running in 2008, so shows what I know...)  If Hillary does not run, Joe Biden is the next in line.  As I explained in another answer,  Would Joe Biden have a chance at becoming the president if he ran in 2016?  I think all indications are that Joe is seriously considering a run, and has a great shot at the nomination.  If neither of the two run, the Dems would have as wide open a field as they have since 1992.  Potential candidates, in no particular order, include governors Andrew Cuomo of NY, Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, Martin O'Malley of Maryland, John Hickenlooper of Colorado, and Mark Warner, former Governor and now Senator from Virginia.  Other potential Senators would be Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota, and perhaps Kirsten Gillibrand, New York, and Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts.  Although the last 3 would have to have a very eventful next 2 years to raise their profiles.  Lastly, I think Mayors Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles, and Cory Booker of  Newark may throw their hats in the ring.  If I had to pick from these, I think Mr. Cuomo would be leading. The Republican side is more complicated, to say the least.  Where Dems completely bury their losers and fall in love with the newest guy, Republicans have long had a tendency to nominate the guy who has earned the nomination with loyalty and service to the party.  Often, this happens even if the candidate is clearly past his prime, as it were.  (See Bob Dole '96, John McCain '08.)  For 2016, there is no clear ""next in line"" candidate.  The last time the Republicans were in a similar situation, in 2000, they went with the son of their last President.  In many ways, I think the establishment would love to have another Bush brother.  But whether the country is ready for another one of them is another question, even if, sadly for Jeb, he is far better than W, and should have been the choice back in 2000. Then there is a natural sense for failed candidates to think that, but for some small mistakes, they could have won, and to have the itch to try again.  That list includes Rick Perry, Ric Santorum, Michele Bachman, Tim Pawlenty, and Mike Huckabee.  Other than the last two, I for one can't see the rest have any chance.  Paul Ryan was certainly a loyal soldier, but he failed to make a very positive impression in his VP run, and as a member of the Republican House, in the current climate, he will have few chances to raise a positive profile.   The Republican contest in '16 will be as open as any in memory.  But more fundamentally, the G.O.P. must make some serious decisions.  Do they choose to continue being a dogmatic far right party, whose policies appeal strictly to elderly white men in the deep South and other small states?  If so, there are any number of potential candidates.  From governors Bobby Jindal, Nicky Haley, and Scott Walker, to Senators Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, are all appealing to the core of the party, but tokenism aside, I don't see them having any broad appeal to America's rapidly changing population.   Or on the other hand, is the party ready to return to being a majority party.  One that is stil conservative, but not a revolutionary, destructive party, that violently kicks out those of us who are ""moderate,"" or willing to compromise and bargain?  Namely, are they ready to return to the being the party of Reagan and Bush I?  If they are ready for that change, there are a number of candidates who could win the general election.  Jon Huntsman, Mitch Daniels, Rob Portman, and Chris Christie come to mind.  But fact is, none of the above had any shot at the Republican nomination in 2012.   If I had to pick, I think Paul Ryan is the current leading choice.  Cuomo vs. Paul in 2016?? (Bonus:  I'm thinking both pick Latins for VP.  Paul picks Gov. Martinez of New Mexico, and Cuomo and Villaraigosa together?

Italian Restaurant,What is good italian restaurant in manhattan new york?,"I SODI!!! Absolutely the BEST! I was there with my Husband, who is carnivore.

Right away He changed His mind and asked for it rare. The server thought HE had it right the first time. ‚ÄúWe cook the steak on the lighter side,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMedium-rare here is like rare in the rest of America.‚ÄùAlthough it has been in business on one of Christopher Street‚Äôs less rollicking blocks for eight years now, I Sodi seems not to have fully assimilated into the United States. It exists in its own extraterritorial jurisdiction, like the headquarters of the United Nations. To eat there is to abide by the laws of eating that Rita Sodi, the chef and owner, brought with her from the farm north of Florence where she was raised. These private laws dictate a menu that is rigidly Tuscan. In Its only previous review in the New York Times an unstarred notice in 2008, Julia Moskin reported that I Sodi offered one risotto, two pastas, three main courses and ‚Äúa couple of salads.‚Äù The menu has grown since then, but it has not wandered into other regions of Italy. And if you are inclined to pop your head into the kitchen to ask for fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled shrimp, you may want to make sure that Ms. Sodi does not have a knife in her hand. The laws also require cooking that is mercilessly yoked to the season. When artichokes are good, they will appear on the menu under antipasti (sliced into a clean and guileless salad of pale, papery shavings that squeak between your teeth, my Husband¬¥s words, dressed with shards of Parmigiano-Reggiano and a peppery young olive oil); contorni (fried until their young leaves are curled, crisp and bronze); and primi (layered with b√©chamel into a green lasagna, as plump and yielding as a featherbed, with so many thin and tender pasta sheets that He have never been able count them all, though HE doesn't like eating them). The current food scene rewards egotistic gestures of novel techniques or ingredient pairings above rigorous devotion to tradition like Ms. Sodi‚Äôs. But there can‚Äôt be any doubt that she is one of the city‚Äôs great pasta practitioners when you eat I Sodi‚Äôs square little chestnut-filled chestnut-flour tortelli in a sauce of butter and grated cheese, or butter-slicked ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach under fried sage leaves, or spaghetti cacio e pepe, noodles that twirl up into your mouth with a wiggle, carrying a black-pepper bite that lingers on and on. If you want to eat at one of the eight or so tables that are draped in white cloths, make a reservation. If you want to eat on one of the 16 backless leather seats at the bar, show up early. The dining room is spartan, tight, untheatrical and almost always packed. According to some stalkers of Italian flavor, you should stay away from I Sodi‚Äôs risotto, for which other regions are better known than Tuscany. Certainly the underseasoned and gummy mushroom risotto I left on my plate recently couldn‚Äôt compete with any of Ms. Sodi‚Äôs pastas. There is no penalty if you don‚Äôt drink one of the seven Negroni variations, only rewards if you do. Drinking two, at $13 to $15 each, will be cheaper than a bottle of wine. There are some real treats on the list, many from exactly the region you‚Äôd expect, but very few cost less than $70.

Italian Restaurant,Why is pasta cheap to make but expensive at the restaurants? What is the history behind this?,"Good pasta is not that cheap. Sure, you can buy cheap ass pasta, but that does not taste good and does not cook well. If you want good quality pasta you need to spend much more. Here in Italy cheap ass pasta costs around 50 euro cents per bag (1/2 kilo), decent supermarket pasta costs about 1 euro per bag, superior quality pasta costs up to 3‚Äì4 euro per bag. Obviously, the restaurants don‚Äôt buy pasta per half kilo bag, they buy it by very large bags packaged for the food industry which are cheaper. But pasta is not the only ingredient. You need to make it into a dish by adding meats, vegetables, fats, herbs etc. A basic tomato sauce for 4 is made of a tablespoon of extravirgin olive oil, one garlic clove, a few basil leaves, and a few tomatoes. You can buy cheap ass ingredients (olive oil instead of extravirgin, garlic granules, cheap tomatoes that have no flavor, garlic granules that are sharp and unpleasant) and produce a cheap sauce that does not taste particularly good. If you want to produce a really good simple sauce you need to use top ingredients: really good extravirgin olive oil, flavorful and ripe small tomatoes, etc. But honestly you don‚Äôt go to a restaurant for making the kind of easy pasta you can easily and quickly make at home. You should go to a restaurant to eat an expecially delicate pasta with unusual and flavorful ingredients. Would you like a portion of tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms and truffle (thinly slice the fresh porcini, heat some butter, add the porcini, a pinch of pepper, a pinch of salt, when the porcini are done, add a ladleful of pasta cooking water, then add the pasta, toss to combine, plate, add a shaving of truffle and a pinch of parsley. That‚Äôs just as fast, but it requires much more pricey ingredients. Then there is another element that makes a dish like that cost quite a lot in a restaurant: service and location. When you eat at a restaurant you do notjut pay for the food, you pay for the kitchen workers, for the front of the house workers, for the space itself, the furniture, the advertsing, etc. These elements all build up the price, and how much they do is not relative to the cost of the raw materials.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-pasta-cheap-to-make-but-expensive-at-the-restaurants-What-is-the-history-behind-this,,,,,

Italian Restaurant,"What is the best Italian restaurant in Portland, Oregon?","Clearly, there are a lot of good choices here! Mine are all longtime family-run businesses. I list them here in the order they opened. Caro Amico Italian Cafe , on SW Barbur Blvd. It‚Äôs been a fixture in the same location since it was opened in 1949 by Fred Baker and Joe Fracasso; it introduced pizza to Portland, and had a loyal following since it opened. I was lucky enough to live in walking distance in the early 1980s. When Fred‚Äôs son Jack left Caro Amico in 1959, he built a small pizzeria on NE Fremont. The original location burned but he rebuilt, and the replacement structure became  Amalfi's Italian Restaurant , which opened in 1965. It, too, has a generational following, and is now owned by Jack‚Äôs daughter. (Fred's grandson Scott is also in the pizza business.)

We first became aware of Amalfi‚Äôs from the wonderful aroma as we were driving by, and weren‚Äôt disappointed when we were able to get there for a birthday dinner. Our current go-to, since it‚Äôs close to home. Its founder had also been involved with Caro Amico. DeNicola's Authentic Italian Restaurant , which celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, is still in the same location on SE Powell where it began. Its original recipes were brought to America by Giovanni and Rosina DeNicola, who founded the restaurant; it is now operated by their daughter Donata, her sons Patrick and Johnny, and her brother Nick.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Italian-restaurant-in-Portland-Oregon,,,,,
Italian Restaurant,Why did Jamie Oliver's restaurants fail? Was the food really that bad?,"To be honest, I hadn't realised they were failing! But, reading many of the other answers would definitely make me think Jamie Oliver's restaurants are ALL failing‚Ä¶. Which has led me to putting in my two pence as it were (I used to say 2 cents when I was living in the Caribbean, same difference really). I have been to 3 of Jamie's restaurants‚Äî two of them I have been to regularly. I visited Jamie's Italian in Gatwick Airport‚Ä¶solely because it had the shortest line out of all the other restaurants‚Ä¶it was a mad time! We had fish and chips for lunch, service was great despite the extreme business, price wise it was a bit steep however we knew it would be. I admit, I was still hungry- might have been the saltiness of the fish. A few years later, I took my mother and sister to Jamie's Italian in Westfield (Stratford). The server was lovely, slightly busy dinner service but again great service. The food was incredible as was the dessert‚Ä¶we had pasta dishes, and i was definitely not hungry this time.  I went again last year for their lunchtime service. I admit was tempted to walk straight back out as the person greeting us walked away a few seconds later without a word, then a server came and seated us. The server looked after us really well and I didn't see the first person after this.   The following year, a friend of mine was visiting me from the North East of England after many years apart, so to celebrate we went to Fifteen. I had no idea what to expect, neither did she. Turns out, the food was incredibly delicious, we did have two servers which was odd- both were attentive and offered advice to suit our diets, so I guess it doesn't matter‚Ä¶the bartenders were also pretty friendly when we arrived actually. My main had smoked salmon eggs and it was the first time I had ever eaten them. Really surprising. In a good way, I promise. What i remember the most was my dessert. I can only describe it as a chocolate playground on my plate‚Ä¶it was so gorgeous, frankly I wish they still did it so I could go back just for that. I have been back to Fifteen in November 2017. I may have come across a bit rude to the servers, I did apologise but as ever they were professional and forgiving, service was great and my friend who had never been to any of ‚Äòthose' restaurants was shocked at how good the food was and the restaurant staff. So‚Ä¶..I dunno, maybe I'm getting special treatment or something?‚Ä¶I suppose great service and food doesn't imply that a business isn't in freefall, but ‚Ä¶ Edit 25/05/2019 Oh dear, Jamie's gone into administration. Shame!! But as long as the restaurants are open, the menus are great and my wallet can support it I wouldn't have any problems going his restaurants.",https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Jamie-Olivers-restaurants-fail-Was-the-food-really-that-bad,"The questions fails to make clear that the chain has failed in  Australia , not the UK.

The experience. The restaurateur‚Äôs art is to be able to give that good experience to the clientele that they attract. It was interesting that each of the early comments came up with a negative impression. Not good for longevity! However, I think that you will find that the biggest problem with Jamie‚Äôs restaurants is the business management.",You went to his Italian restauraunt at the airport yet you got one of the most common British foods Fish and Chips.

Ibanez Series S,What is the best acoustic guitar under $500 that can be used by professionals?,"As many have said here, it depends on how you play and what kind of music you play as much as many other factors. What sounds good to YOU matters as well, of course. You‚Äôll play better on something that seems to sound better to YOU. And only YOU can make that call. That said, I‚Äôll comment on some things said here. I couldn't agree more with Ron Swanson‚Äôs endorsement of the Epiphone Masterbuilt series. I own a $4,000 Martin 00028-EC and I play my Epiphone Masterbuilt EF-500 about as much. The Martin is without a doubt a far superior instrument, but when I first came across the Epi Masterbuilts I was really impressed. You can find them for under $500 if you look around and for that you get (with almost all) a solid wood instrument with premium appointments, electronics, bone nut and saddle and MUCH better projection and depth that I‚Äôve ever found on an Ovation or Sigma or Ibanez or Alvarez or really almost any other acoustic. I‚Äùve also played a Tacoma (someone mentioned that here) and was disappointed‚Ä¶ no really projection and depth. Even high-end Taylors often sound very thin (especially in contrast to my Martin even though its a small body)‚Ä¶ and if what you want is fullness and projection‚Ä¶ MOST guitars under $500 will come up short. The Masterbuilts rarely fail to impress me. You can sometimes find a nice Guild for that money and they have a great sound‚Ä¶ You can RARELY find a Gibson for that‚Ä¶ if you do find one, it may have problems. After years of being Gibson‚Äôs trash brand (the late 70‚Äôs through the 80‚Äôs) Epiphone is once again making instruments worthy of its name.

On other hand the Edge used on the RG550 Genesis, the Lo-Pro Edge and the Edge Pro are the best trem units ever made by Ibanez till date. They were extremely high quality trems that were made in Japan by Gotoh.

In order of importance is: The ability and style of the person playing the guitar the amp and pedals the guitar Do not rule out hollow or semi-hollow. Especially if you come from an acoustic back ground.",,,,
Ibanez Series S,What guitar has the most flexibility in tone generation?,"I‚Äôll start by saying this.  Most guitars are really versatile.  It‚Äôs just how this works. At the end of the day, there‚Äôs only so many types of pickups and so many ways to wire them. You can use any guitar for any style. Teles in metal? Sure. A jazz box for some chicken pickin‚Äô? Why not? A hot-rodded super strat for ambient clean tones? Well, slap my momma and call me Sally, you‚Äôd best do that! (Please do not actually   slap my momma or call me Sally.) I‚Äôll also add this. I‚Äôll be staying with stock, non-boutique guitars. Stuff that most musicians can actually reliably get their hands on. Otherwise, this thing has already won.  This is the Mary by Relish Guitars. 24 frets, 2 pickups. Its pickups are mounted magnetically, and it can have either humbuckers or P90‚Äôs. (To swap them, you pop the back off, also mounted magnetically, and it‚Äôs simple from there.) It‚Äôs selector ‚Äúswitch‚Äù is actually a tough-sensitive pad that can blend between the pickups. When set up with humbuckers, it can be coil split, and each pickup can be split individually. It also has a piezo system, with an independent volume circuit. The thing has some tones. The one thing it‚Äôs missing is a trem. Some guitars are incredibly versatile by their nature. The Ibanez RG series, especially if you go for HSH options. Fender Strats. Hendrix, Clapton, Mayer. Need I say more? Jaguars and Jazzmasters have a lot of tonal options, within certain parameters. So what beats all of those? I would argue this bad boy.  The PRS Custom 24 is the one true king. 24 frets. Two humbuckers and a coil split, optional piezo, and a trem system. It‚Äôs missing some of the blending capabilities and P90‚Äôs of the Mary, but adds a trem. It‚Äôs as close as you‚Äôre likely to get in a production guitar. I chose the Custom 24 over other guitars in the 2 hums with coil splits category because it wasn‚Äôt designed specifically for one style. Paul Reed Smith just set out to build the best guitar possible. Stylistic neutrality, combined with being arguably the most versatile of the lot on features alone. On features, the Custom 24 has what you want, and arguably more than you‚Äôll need. It‚Äôs only missing P90‚Äôs and a middle pickup. You can get so many tones from what this has.",https://masteringguitargear.quora.com/What-guitar-has-the-most-flexibility-in-tone-generation,"Weeeellll‚Ä¶nah. PRS makes a wonderful instrument and is a fine modern gentleman (I spilled beer on him at a guitar show in Dallas back in the mid 90s and he didn't call me one single explative enhanced thing. Sorry man, the bass player ran me over, I swear!) But there are a couple I have to point out. The Jem 777 from Ibanez. Vai had it wired specifically to get as many options as possible out of the pups, it's not the same as an RG with the same configuration. Next up the time line is the most versatile of all and the only real example of innovation in the guitar world since Leo and Less‚Ä¶the original Parker Fly. With switching options do numerous I can't remember them all, a piezoelectric pickup system built in the bridge and blending pots to add to the dimarzios as you choose, stereo output, and a tremelo you can raise, lower, adjust for tension and block off with your fingertips without removing a single screw, it's pretty much the definition of versatile. Add the pressed tonewood with carbon graphite overlay body and surface mounted stainless steel frets, and a weigh in of just over 4lbs, and man I just dare you to name anything else even remotely similar. Did I mention it feels like playing your favorite air guitar? It does. And on to the most recent addition. The Ernie Ball Musicman Majesty, brainchild and signature model of John Petrucci, aka The Man, guitar virtuoso deluxe. It offers the same pickup layout as the Fly, but stays inside the more traditional configuration of tonewood construction. Speaking of which, the fit and finish on Musicman guitars is such that certain other companies could really do to take notes, you can feel the quality of the build as soon as you pick it up. They've had some growing pains here and there but have sorted them out and honestly they deserve the reputation that others have but I'm not pointing fingers (üëâGIBSON!) Ok I lied, COPE. Anyhow, thought I'd share that little bit of opinion‚Ä¶jokes aside, do try to play a real Parker someday, I still wish Ken would bring it back someday, maybe 25years later the world is ready to acknowledge it's unique genius‚Ä¶",,,,
Ibanez Series S,Guitar: Why is Fender cheaper than Gibson?,"Fender uses the ‚ÄúFender‚Äù brand name for most of their guitar product line, from the most expensive boutique reproductions and special editions all the way down to bog-standard Teles and Strats. They added the ‚ÄúSquier‚Äù nameplate back in the ‚Äô80s for their very cheapest, entry level guitars in their catalog, but even those still have ‚ÄúFender‚Äù printed on them in smaller type. Their goal is to have the name everywhere, so everyone knows that everyone from beginner to pro uses Fender products. Gibson only uses the ‚ÄúGibson‚Äù name for their ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù, in order to preserve the brand‚Äôs reputation for high-end, quality instruments. Their goal is to have people see the Gibson name and think, ‚Äúooooh, a Gibson ‚Äî nice!‚Äù Sort of the equivalent of Lexus vs. Toyota. Their lower-priced, assembly-line versions bear the ‚ÄúEpiphone‚Äù nameplate instead, so they don‚Äôt sully the Gibson badge‚Äôs ‚Äúluxury‚Äù cachet. You won‚Äôt find the ‚ÄúGibson‚Äù name anywhere on an Epiphone guitar, or even on the Epiphone website. There‚Äôs even a running controversy about the shape of the headstock ‚Äî Les Paul fans are forever petitioning Gibson to use the trademark ‚Äúopen book‚Äù headstock design on Epiphone Les Pauls and SGs, so they don‚Äôt scream ‚Äúbudget series‚Äù quite so loudly on stage. It‚Äôs not totally cut and dried though. In the ‚Äò70s, Gibson execs did try to put their nameplate on some cheaper guitars and compete with Fender‚Äôs populist appeal. I actually own one of these: a 1980 Gibson L6-S Custom, designed by pickup-master Bill Lawrence with B.B. King as a consultant, and made from cheaper materials targeting the Stratocaster‚Äôs price point. It‚Äôs a heap of fun to play, though annoyingly neck-heavy, but that‚Äôs another story. By the 1980s, in the wake of the ‚ÄúIbanez Les Paul Lawsuit‚Äù, Gibson closed ranks around its status-symbol branding and turned over all future value models to the Epiphone badge. They‚Äôre both sound marketing strategies. But taken as a whole, the two product lines are actually pretty similar in price range and quality. The difference is mostly in the naming conventions.",https://www.quora.com/Guitar-Why-is-Fender-cheaper-than-Gibson,,,,,
Tricking,What are some secret tricks you should know about Windows?,"You can change any Windows OS password without any clue of the current password.
 Step1:
Open  Command Prompt  ( Run as administrator  in Windows Vista/7/8) (In Windows XP you don't need to run as administrator)  How to Run as administrator?? (In the search box, type  CMD , right click on this and there would be an option named ""Run as administrator"", click and choose ""Yes"" to proceed further)
OR
 (In general, if you want to run any application as an administrator you can use ""Ctrl+Shift+Left_click"")
 Step2:   Type "" net user "" without quotes and press enter. It will show all the active accounts (for example, Administrator, Guest, temp, etc.) Step3:   Now choose an account name for which you want to change the password (let's say you chose the  ABC  account) Step4:  Type "" net user ABC "" without quotes and press enter. You'll see core details of your account.
 (NOTE: This step is just to verify whether you chose right account or not) Step5:  In the last step you type "" net user ABC * "" without quotes and press enter.
(Note: after the account name, there is a single space and then an  asterisk  (AKA star)) Now it will ask for a new password :)
Enter the desired password and re-enter for confirmation and you are DONE!!  (Note : when you type the password you won't be able to see the password you're typing, but it is actually happening, so don't worry about that, but be careful about what you type (as you can see in the below attached photo, the password is not visible to anyone even I can't see).) Here is the screenshot of this process in Windows 8.

In the same way, you can disable/deactivate any user account. [ Warn!! ]

2) WIN_KEY + i  =  setting panel (In Windows 8)
3) WIN_KEY + x = another useful shortcut in Windows 8 for control panel, dev manager
4) Shift + Right_Click = choose ""open command window here"" to open CMD anywhere in the windows. (Useful option for programmers :))
5) WIN_KEY + TAB = 3D view of all opened windows (use CTRL + WIN_KEY + TAB to hold windows in 3D view) and press TAB button to move windows forward (SHIFT+TAB to move backward). Make a folder without a name:
Select file or folder and rename it (or press F2 as described above), clear the current name. Now hold the ""Alt"" key and press 0160 from the right-side number keypad and now release the ""Alt"" key and Enter. (It won't work if you use keyboard's upper number line.) ( NOTE :  Most of the modern laptops don't have the right-side number keypad so one way to do this is get a external keyboard or another shortcut is right click and choose "" Insert Unicode control character "" option and then LRM (left to right) .)

Presidential Election,Could Bill Gates win the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?,"Not a chance.  Ignore the reality that no party would nominate him.  The reality of running for President of the USA is that it requires a tremendous amount of infrastructure.  Not just a lot of money and a bit of internet savvy.  You need to get registered and on the ballot in every state...sounds easy, it's not.  For instance, numerous states tried to keep Obama off the ballot insisting that his short form birth certificate wasn't legitimate.  Being an effective candidate requires a lot of machinery (media buy teams, advance teams, position paper writers to provide details even if you already have a position on something).  You'd need to get an office in very state (and that would be a ""fail""...we're really talking about an office in every congressional district) and then volunteers to do stuff like...knock on doors...help with registration...make calls...stuff envelopes...all the blocking and tackling of campaigns that ain't glorious but is critical.  It helps if you've done this before (and Gates hasn't) so you have contacts in particular states.  It helps if you've run in the primaries (so you already have contacts, initial donors, a network established).  That sounds simple, it ain't.  Gates travels to...let's say...Iowa to campaign.  He needs not only a bus for the candidate and his staff, he needs a bus for the media (so they cover him and provide free campaign ads with that coverage).  But the media won't pay for people to travel if they're doing nothing but sitting on a bus all day with one speech.  So Gates (Presidential candidate) needs to have multiple events and stops...stop at a soup kitchen to pose feeding the hungry (or doing dishes), stop at a metro or plant to shake hands as people go to work, go meet the mayor (and get pictures shaking his hand)...speak at a local university or radio station (again, more pictures)...maybe a local media interview or 3...and then a campaign stop with donors to raise money and get visibility and give a speech that ends up on the evening news (well, 8 seconds of it anyway).  That requires an experienced special events planner to work out with a political advisor and advance team for each trip.  That's going on with the visit to Iowa--Gates then gets on a plan and flies to St. Louis (and a different team is there working those issues).  And no, you can't afford to pay all those people most of your campaign is staffed by volunteers (who got training in the primaries...otherwise you've got amateurs making goofs during the campaign and the media cover them b/c that's the story of the day...like the time Romney gave a speech in Detroit at the SilverDome (football stadium) and he had less than 40 people there.  There were more media members than attendees and they all wrote about it (b/c it was funny and unique) but it was a black-eye that day for Romney.",https://www.quora.com/Could-Bill-Gates-win-the-2016-U-S-Presidential-Election,95% of the things you mentioned could be bought.,,,,
Presidential Election,Are you angry about the 2016 US presidential election?,"Nope. Back in 1999, I entered my last year of earning my undergraduate degree in Political Science at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. Many of the undergraduate political junkies in my major were already predicting a Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama ticket for 2008. They also predicted the campaign would be the first billion dollar Presidential campaign. I had a Political Science class were I worked with two other students on creating a presidential campaign and strategy for Donald Trump as a Democrat. It was my idea. I based it around the movie Bulworth, Trump‚Äôs connection to the hip hop community, and using his casinos to lure voters to register to vote with free gambling credit. We were laughed at and not taken seriously. I will now answer your question. Every single candidate wasn‚Äôt fit for the job. This was the first election where I felt queasy voting. I am an independent voter. I don‚Äôt vote based on party lines. I vote based on who I feel will be the best leader for the country. I knew that my vote wouldn‚Äôt count in my state. My state is traditionally red. But I still had the courage to go to the polls and make myself heard. That‚Äôs all that I can do. I‚Äôm not a wealthy individual that can create commercials, super PACs, and nonprofits to shape the political landscape of the nation.  The 10 most influential billionaires in politics I‚Äôm not a celebrity with a huge social media following that can Tweet something and instantly see my words and face in the media.  From Audrey Hepburn to Katy Perry: 22 Celebrities Who Became Political Activists But I am an American that believes 100% that it is my duty and responsibility to be a civic citizen engaged in the political business of my country. I cannot become mad, angry, or any other negative emotion about one election result. I know that there are many different elections taking place across the USA from local to county to regional to state to federal. My local councilman for my municipality is up for reelection in November. His decisions directly affect my life everyday. The President isn‚Äôt a king or god. The President is one person who is a figurehead for the United States. They speak for us in a united voice. They embody us on the global stage. The goal is for them to help bring all Americans together, keep the USA prosperous, and continue to build it up for future generations. In the end, I know that the USA is bigger than one person or one election. I am focused on November 2017 elections locally. I am also looking ahead to the elections that will take place in my state in 2018.  Georgia elections, 2018 - Wikipedia  We have many different political elections taking place. Everything from the governor to the Commissioner of Agriculture. It‚Äôs bigger than the President of the United States of America. He or she isn‚Äôt the only show in town. Being angry or myopic doesn‚Äôt help me. I realize that political outcomes happen for a reason. The citizens of the USA received the candidate that the majority of the people wanted to see in the office. He won the electoral votes.  Trump‚Äôs victory another example of how Electoral College wins are bigger than popular vote ones In every election, there are going to be winners and losers. The so-called best candidate doesn‚Äôt always win. There will be upsets. Some candidates won‚Äôt be able to articulate their message to connect with voters. Others will lack the necessary experience to be taken seriously by voters. While still others will be considered toxic and owned by corporations. Your candidate might not make it to the finish line. They may not have enough money to withstand attacks. If they are vulnerable in any way, an intelligent candidate will use that weakness to their advantage. They will turn a hairline fracture into an amputation so that the other candidate will look completely unfit for office. Sometimes it backfires, but it mostly works. It worked this time! The only thing that I can do is support the current President. I don‚Äôt have to agree with all of his words, his tactics, his strategies, or his behavior. But I will respect the person in the office. And at the same time, I will see who else is fit for the office that I can support in the future. I focus on the short, medium, and long game. When you lose, don‚Äôt become a sore loser. Accept defeat. Lick your wounds. Figure out why you lost. Connect with the people.

Presidential Election,Can the Republican Party win the 2016 Presidential election?,"Yes.  Although it is indeed very early in the race, already some deciding factors have emerged. I think there are four points that - as of right now - lend a lot of credence to the notion that a Republican candidate will win.   The two leading Democrats cannot win the general election.  Bernie is too far left, thus alienating the essential swing votes. Hillary is too ""sketchy"" for America to ever actually want her; the whole email thing is evidence that voters will take even the slightest problem to withdraw their support.
 The Republican race is interesting.  There are a lot of really good Republican candidates (nine former/present governors [1] and four former/present U.S. senators [2]). There's also Donald Trump, who is adding a lot of attention and excitement to the race. This is ultimately a good thing as it probably encourages a higher voter turnout rate (for the right). The Republican candidates are reshaping the party's image.  Although the GOP is largely still the same old GOP it always was, it's candidates are new. They're more diverse than ever. Young. Women. Hispanic. Black. Indian. This gives voters the impression that the Republican Party is different, which is ultimately more important, at least in terms of elections. The Democrats have recently accomplished most of what they've set out to accomplish.  Every once in awhile a political party will get behind a few ""key"" issues and win widespread support. The Democrats did this with gay marriage, legalization of marijuana, and universal healthcare. However, now, gay marriage is legal. States can choose to legalize drugs or not. The ACA was passed. The Democrats are low on goals and thus compelling reasons to vote for them. [1]  Governors and the 2016 Presidential Race

They embraced them AFTER they succeeded. Obama is still not for federal legalization of non medical pot. FDR liberals (progressives) did not get the single payer healthcare they deserve yet.   Us liberals are not anywhere near where we want the country to be. It would be completely foreign to your understanding of reality to live in a peaceful, prosperous, and happy country we envision.  The Dem race is still early in the second half and Bernie is ahead of where Obama was in his battle with Hillary. No reason to count him out yet. ",Love to know your thoughts now,,
Presidential Election,Did the 2020 US presidential election results disappoint you?,"Nope. in fact, it basically confirmed my feelings that this election was a lose-lose situation.  On one hand we got Donald Trump, a man who has an unpleasant personality (but did good things like reducing unemployment levels to super low numbers before the pandemic hit, stood with the Hong kong protesters, got America out of the INF treaty, made Mexico crack harder on illegal immigrants, ordered the operation that killed  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,  trying to decriminalize Homosexuality around the world and appoint a lot of conservative judges).  on the other hand we got Joe Biden, who at least has a nicer, quieter personality than Donald Trump. The problem is that he can‚Äôt think straight for a long time, and he even admits that this is going to be a one term presidency. He also has done shadier things like deporting illegal immigrants more than Trump, helped Obama create the separation family policy, Voted to ban immigrants with HIV, locking Haitian refugees up in Guantanamo Bay, voted for the disastrous Iraq war, helped Obama send drone strikes which killed 90 percent of civilians, and has a horrible foreign policy.  Okay, so basically our two options are an orange man who has a bad personality, or a nice man who has done shady stuff and isn‚Äôt sharp as he used to before, and his side kick is even more unpopular than Donald Trump. Seriously, how is this election suppose to have good results? This is a lose-lose situation. But you know what really makes me sick? Its the Democrats. This election, exposed the toxic democrats (not all democrats are toxic).  There are Democrats who adopt this mindset that every Republican is a mysognist or sexist or racist people. They wanted to gain more power by having the Senate flip. They wanted Biden to win in a landslide because Trump is ‚Äúevil‚Äù and Republicans are horrible people.  I mean seriously. Just look at this answer right here and tell me that answer is ‚Äúnice.‚Äù  This person‚Ä¶ is angry that other people didnt vote for Joe Biden. Like what? He calls the people who didnt vote ‚Äúignorant, misinformed, and intentionally maligned. how is this going to heal this political division? The democrats desperately want to flip the Senate, but they couldnt. You know why? Its because of recent events like BLM riots and the attitudes democrats had toward republicans.  The results of this election didn‚Äôt dissapoint me because it was a lose-lose situation. Joe Biden has a nice personality, but I don‚Äôt think he would have the mental acuity to govern the country for four more years due to his age. Donald Trump has a nasty personality. Our choices either way are screwed. The democrats desperately want to flip the Senate but they didn‚Äôt. This is going to cause them to be more angrier. What‚Äôs going to happen is that our politics are going to be more divisive than ever now. I honestly wished the democrats actually used Andrew Yang and Tulsi Gabbard because those two democrats are the only ones willing to negotiate and bridge the division between democrats and republicans. No one won in this election. Everyone lost. It honestly didn‚Äôt dissapoint me because I was expecting this. I was surprised at how the Senate gained more republican seats.",https://www.quora.com/Did-the-2020-US-presidential-election-results-disappoint-you,"I disagree that no one won. Biden will probably accomplish very little, but we needed a detox from all the poison that Trump was both injecting into American life and bringing out. It dawned on me too late, but I finally realized that if you want to vote against Antifa and the more obnoxious leftists, vote against Trump. He‚Äôs the one who brings them out in spades. He puts the wind under the wings not only of the far right. His mere presence is like an Energizer bunny for the annoying far left, too. Seriously, if Biden accomplishes nothing else than being boring and our frazzled nerves calm down as a result, then I think that‚Äôs a win for America. What we desperately need right now is civility, and Biden is by far the more civil of the two options. (Though I completely agree with you that Democrats can be rude, cold and sneering beyond belief, I don‚Äôt see so much of that in Biden.)","Great answer and a message I try to get through to all the headline smart people on here, who think because they own a phone and have access to Wikipedia and other sources which clearly have biases, know about politics.

There is actually a better candidate who both republicans and democrats can agree with. He is Andrew Yang.

This way, it will significantly ease the amount of job losses that will inevitably come. He actually cares for the people, and not himself.

Italian Restaurant,"What's the best Italian restaurant in Eugene, Oregon?","Your question is really subjective‚Ä¶ There are a dozen very good Italian restaurants in Eugene. It seems just about everyone can make a pizza these days however, there is so much more to fine Italian dinning than just a pizza, and all the Italian restaurants here in Eugene make a decent pizza. If you are looking for the best menu with a variety of choices the general consensus among locals narrows down to five and in no particular order to, Pastini, Beppe & Gianni's Trattoria, Placido's Pasta Shop, Ambrosia Restaurant & Bar, and La Perla Pizzeria. All offer a robust menu including ‚ÄòGluten-Free‚Äô and all similar in price. The only issue is parking, Eugene is cramped for space and parking is a premium.

Italian Restaurant,What can you eat in an Italian restaurant?,"This is a very complex question to answer. Italy is really rich of culture, has been conquered by so many different countries, and influenced by so many cultures, that of course influenced also the food. Italy is also so much fragmented and divided by mountains in the nord and throughout the center spine, from the sea all around, the geography influences also what produce can you cultivate and also which animals you can raise, or fish or hunt. I have an Italian restaurant located in the NW of the USA. I am originally from central Italy and many of the dishes that I have are original to center and northern Italy. A lot of customers, especially first timers get confused to not find some staples of the ‚ÄúItalian‚Äù cuisine like Alfredo sauce or Chiken Cacciatore or Chicken Parmigiana or Spaghetti Meatballs. But actually this is a list of dishes you will not find in a restaurant in Italy. But still, in most of Italy. Even though I lived for about 32 years almost straight there, and traveled extensively, I still cannot say that I know all the dishes. The cuisine changes regionally and also there are variations of recipes at the province level, and there are 20 regions in Italy. What can you eat in an Italian restaurant: depends where the restaurant is located, this is the beauty of Italian cuisine.",https://www.quora.com/What-can-you-eat-in-an-Italian-restaurant,,,,,
Italian Restaurant,How is food served in Italy different from what is served in Italian restaurants in the USA?,"Let me start saying that in Italy the big dinner is actually the big lunch. Sunday lunch is the one that you stay at the table, with some breaks for short strolls, smoking a cigarette or chatting with the other guests, for 4 hours or longer. About how you order: the entr√©e does not exist, I think it is a habit acquired from French cuisine. The courses are the following: Appetizers, usually a mix of cold and warm offers. Sometimes just a single thing, most time a 5 to 10 different bites/ elements. Then you have the pasta, usually the portion are at least a third smaller than what offered in the USA Italian restaurants. Then you have the fish or meat course. In case you have both they are totally divided, in Italy you do not have the culture of the surf & turf. To an Italian in Italy actually looks pretty horrible, also because most of the fish eaten in Italy have a very light, savory flavor that would be totally overwhelmed by the meat flavor. After the fish you have a palate cleanser, like a lemon sorbet and you go to meat. The fish and meat courses are served by themselves, if you want sides you need to order them as an additional separate item. Salad can be order as a side as well or a final course before dessert. Fruit, especially if in fruit salad forms dressed usually with lemon juice and sugar are considered dessert. Chocolate is very appreciated but does not have the same ‚Äúscreaming dessert feeling‚Äù that we have in the USA. Dessert are less sweet than in the states and usually fluffier and lighter. Some staple dishes or ingredients like meatball, chicken, veal etc are actually not so common in Italian restaurants. You probably can find them but they are not considered the ‚ÄúItalian thing‚Äù. The restaurant tend to be usually a special place, in larger cities probably you have people going out more often, but in general Italian tend to cook more often at home and they prepare by themselves chicken dishes etc. Talking about pizza: usually there are 2 main restaurant pizza style: Romana, a thin crust crunchy all over with a thin border. Napoli Style, soft at the center, thin as well with a tall fluffy border. Common denominators are sparse use of Mozzarella cheese and not the low moisture, and a few ingredients for toppings. Salumi like Prosciutto, coppa, salame etc are added after the pizza is out of the oven. Here in the states the dry cured salumi are treated like bacon. In Italy we like to keep the original flavor, and use the heat of the pizza to lightly melt the fat. Also pizza is usually personal, each person gets his own. About service: ‚Äúfamily style‚Äù is usually at home, not in restaurants. Most of the dishes are served personal plated. For my experience at the restaurant you want to be served, so we do have the so called ‚ÄúEnglish service‚Äù, I think it is known in the States as ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù, basically a large table that has chosen a multiple coursed menu, has fresh plates in which a server scoops over with fork and spoon appetizers, pastas, meat, sides etc, changing plates each single course. Serving drinks: About beverages the cocktails are reserved to the after dinner at the bar or disco club. Before dinner you could drink a light mixed drink like Venetian spritz (white or sparkling wine mixed with a bitter like Aperol, Campari or Select etc and sparkling water), or just Aperolsoda or Camparisoda or Bellini with peach or or fruit or mimosas. Dinner closes with a bitter spirit digestif ‚ÄúAmaro‚Äù, like J√§germeister, or a hard liquor like grappa, brandy etc and a shot of espresso. The waiter is also not supposed to do a couple of things that would considered bad there and required in the USA: you do not push for more drinks, the customer will ask you if he wants more. The waiter will not drop the check until you will require it, if you do that it would be like an invite to leave. When I just arrived I was having big issues about this two things as a server, asking for another drink look to me really pushy, and dropping the check as soon as your finished really rude. Also because usually you go to the hosting desk where you pay to the person that is managing the cash drawer. The previous list is a general idea, you can find also restaurant that have entr√©e style dishes, especially if they are a tourist area, where they need to adapt to the requests of foreigners. You can probably find also Italo-American dishes as well. At the same time Italian cuisine, even though original and classic is still a changing one, and influenced by new things. One example is sushi, that I discovered almost 20 years ago, and nobody in my area would have touched even with a stick. Nowadays sushi has become really popular as a fresh option, easy to prepare also at home. The safety of consuming raw seafood showed by the sushi preparation, brought with it a larger diffusion of the raw seafood preparation culturally linked mostly to the seaside and the islands of Italy. ‚ÄúCrudo‚Äù(raw) is now fashion all over Italy, thanks to a foreign influence. My restaurant tend to be more original and old style, than my family restaurant in Umbria, where I see popping up dishes that I wouldn't consider classic Italian.",https://www.quora.com/How-is-food-served-in-Italy-different-from-what-is-served-in-Italian-restaurants-in-the-USA,,,,,
Italian Restaurant,What is the best Italian restaurant in Miami?,"Michael, my personal recommendation is Nunzio‚Äôs. It‚Äôs owned and run by an Italian family, with a homey feel both in the ambiance and the kitchen. The food (my recommendation is the gnocchi - best in town) is excellent and family members regularly pass by to make sure you‚Äôre satisfied with your selection, but usually up for some friendly banter. The only reason most people don‚Äôt know about them is their location - way out west, in the FIU area. Up until a few years ago, I had a small ad agency with two other partners, including a small Italian restaurant as a client - Randazzo‚Äôs Little Italy. The name might be familiar, as Marc Randazzo appeared on Rocco DeSpirito‚Äôs show on NBC, plus he was a former boxing champ. The food at the restaurant (now closed) was quite good - and I consider Marc a friend of mine. But even his restaurant, which was located within walking distance of my home, was a second-place finisher to Nunzio‚Äôs - easily a 25-minute drive. That‚Äôs how much I love Nunzio‚Äôs. My second recommendation comes directly from one of my real estate clients, who also happen to be Italian (from Modena, if that gives you any further insight) AND have excellent taste. Just last month, I asked them which Italian restaurant in Miami they considered to be the best. Their reply - ZUCCA, which fortunately is also within walking distance from my home. I‚Äôve only tried it once, but it was an excellent experience. I‚Äôll definitely be returning, soon. Compared to Nunzio‚Äôs, I would say it‚Äôs on the opposite end of the experiential spectrum - cosmopolitan and modern, compared to Nunzio‚Äôs understated charm. But I would recommend you try both. Nunzio‚Äôs is located at 11433 SW 40th Street, Miami. ZUCCA is located at 162 Alcazar, Coral Gables (on the ground floor of the Hotel St. Michel. If you go soon, you can also see the Umbrella Sky installation, a couple of blocks south on Giralda Avenue.)

Italian Restaurant,What are some red flags you're at a bad Italian restaurant?,"Well, a first red flag should be the guaranteed misspelled Italian you can find in the restaurant name or menu. Or a name that actually in Italian have no meaning. But this can be difficult to spot for non-italian speakers. If you find chicken parmesan or linguini alfredo, there‚Äôre no Italians in the kitchen. But of course it‚Äôs all a matter of ingredients. Just a little example: mozzarella. This iconic cheese from cow or buffalo milk is definitely badly imitated around the world. These are some disgraced (sorry guys, this is the right word) examples:    These kinds of cheese have nothing to do with real Italian mozzarella, and, of course, this changes dramatically how your food would taste. This is mozzarella:  Some regional variations: Burrata (not exactly a mozzarella, it‚Äôs a sort of mozzarella filled with cheese and cream):   Treccia:   yes, it‚Äôs leaking milk‚Ä¶ Zizzona:  In Italy, even in the supermarkets you can find fresh mozzarella produced everyday directly in the supermarket or in some nearby dairy. In this supermarket near Milan they produce mozzarella everyday where is written ‚ÄùIl casaro‚Äù:    We‚Äôve got also industrialized mozzarella, but the process follows the artisan way of produce it, unless it couldn‚Äôt be called mozzarella. Less tasty, but still real mozzarella. So just imagine a very simple pizza with a burrata on it, when you cut the burrata and all the filling spread on your pizza:  heaven on earth. Or a more ‚Äúcomplex‚Äú pizza like this, with roasted eggplants, a smoked burrata and boar cheek lard:  And now just imagine the same piiza made with this cheese:  But, this is just a  single  ingredient.

Ibanez Series S,Why do all guitarists have different electric guitars? Do these electric guitars sound different from each other?,"The first electric guitar I bought was because it was a brand that all my friends thought was badass, and because I could afford it. It was an Ibanez back in 1990. Then a GTX because it felt good on my fingers but had terrible wiring. I loved it. I sold both for currently unknown reasons. That was 20 years ago. I bought an Ibanez RG320DX because I liked how it felt and it‚Äôs color but it sounded like shit. Until 2015 that was my only electric and I didn‚Äôt have a lot of motivation, I thought it was me that played like shit tho I was a very good guitarist until I got other much better-crafted guitars. Then I bought an ESP KH-II. Then an LTD M1000 Snow White with a maple fretboard. Those were amazing guitars. I played the LTD more because it had a bright sound the others didn‚Äôt. Then I picked up a few more Ibanez S-series electrics that I ended up not liking at all. Then a Jackson which I fell in love with. And another Jackson similar to it but had a floating bridge that I took on stage with me to Jam with Steve Vai. Wasn‚Äôt gonna use the LTD for that. It sounded amazing. But most importantly, it feels so good that it brings out my most enthusiastic playing. Then I picked up Solar Guitar 7 string and lastly most recent, a Charvel San Dimas Pro Mod with a Titanium floyd rose upgrade that sounds amazing. I just love that thing. This doesn‚Äôt count the different acoustic/classical guitars I have. I recently completely replaced the electronics and wiring on the original RG320DX (a $300 guitar with $1200 of ugprades and luthier work) and it sounds decent but something about the woods/construction of the guitar make it feel like the best guitar I‚Äôve ever fingered upon, but sounds like shit no matter what I do. I keep it for posterity. I play almost exclusively my Jacksons now because they sound amazing and play amazing and brings out the best in me when shredding. The Charvel (which feels exactly like those Jacksons) for clearer, bluesy stuff. I don‚Äôt play the other electrics anymore so often but I do once in a while and they bring out different types of creativity in me. So why so many guitars? They all FEEL different. They bring out different moods or playing styles in me They LOOK different. Sometimes it matters. It mentally helps me with moods, don‚Äôt know why. They have different hardware, weight, length. My ESP, LTD, and RG320DX all have EMG active pickups which are good for heavy metal but I do not always want to play with the sound of EMG‚Äôs. The others have different humbuckers and the two Jacksons have Bare Knuckle pickups and the Charvel has factory and they all sound amazing. The Ibanez factory pickups don‚Äôt sound as good to me and so I don‚Äôt like to record or play live with them. Backups. I like having a backup. Tuning. All 7 of my 8 electric guitars have Floyd Rose bridges. So I use a different guitar for alternate tunings. They are a real pain to setup. I like to do it once and keep it that way even across string changes. I will say, the primary choice of guitar for me now is FEEL and SOUND. Feel comes from the guitar itself. The sound, to my ear, is more influenced by electronics and while I usually replace those anyway, the stock ones matter until I do. In the end, no matter what electric guitar I play, people recognize it‚Äôs me once I hit a few notes. To the public, only one guitar matters.

Ibanez Series S,What is the best electric guitar to buy for progressive and fusion ''shred'' if you like? I am playing for years and need an amazing axe.,"I like using Ibanez guitars for that style. In my opinion, their neck profiles are tailor fit for speed and precision. Checkout the S, RGA and RG series guitars. They have models in every price range from $350‚Äì3500. Recently, I got an RGA742FM 7 string. Made in Indonesia but it‚Äôs very well made and for a very low price. Of course, the lower the cost, the more imperative it is that you test before you buy. That said, my example is very easy to play fast on and there are many sound options to dial in with the 5 way switch and tone/volume knobs. So, it‚Äôs very versatile, not just for metal/shred but can also do blues, pop or jazz. Other brands worth mentioning are Jackson, ESP, Strandberg (if you don‚Äôt mind a higher cost and different style).",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-electric-guitar-to-buy-for-progressive-and-fusion-shred-if-you-like-I-am-playing-for-years-and-need-an-amazing-axe,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What has been done to improve the ‚Äúwhammy bar‚Äù on the guitar since the 1960‚Äôs, when it was sure to detune many guitars that used them?","The double-locking systems have virtually eliminated tuning issues, if you know how to set them properly. I learned early, and have never had a problem with any of them: Floyd Rose, Kahler, Ibanez(Edge series). Pick you're favorite, they all have a different feel.",https://www.quora.com/What-has-been-done-to-improve-the-whammy-bar-on-the-guitar-since-the-1960-s-when-it-was-sure-to-detune-many-guitars-that-used-them,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Has the quality of Jackson guitars suffered since being taken over by Fender?,"No the quality hasn‚Äôt gone down but as far as innovativeness is considered it‚Äôs gone down. Under the ownership of Fender they‚Äôre just rehashing same old Soloist, Dinky, Warrior, RR, Kelly, etc designs. They aren‚Äôt reworking or improving them further, they aren‚Äôt coming up with any new series of guitars with new designs. Compared to them look at Ibanez they always come up with something new and unique. ESP does new and exciting stuffs with their guitar range too. Even Schecter which is usually seen as a boring guitar brand is doing cooler stuffs with their guitars than Jackson. As of Jackson, their guitars remains the same with minor changes here and there. Even their artist signature models aren‚Äôt substantially different from their standard models. Even their custom shop order options are restrictive in terms of options. So I would say although ownership by Fender hasn‚Äôt ruined their quality but in many ways they have turned Jackson into another Fender. And it‚Äôs not just Jackson, look at Charvel. When was the last time you heard about Charvel making exciting and new kind of guitars? 80‚Äôs, may be 90‚Äôs. After Charvel has gone under Fender they have barely done anything new with their guitars. If you thought Jackson was rehashing things, then wait till you see what Charvel has turned into under the ownership of Fender, because all the new Charvel company does is to rehash the guitars from its early days. Then again at least their condition isn‚Äôt as bad as Kramer under Gibson ownership. Because under Gibson ownership Kramer devolved from one of the most innovative and exciting guitar brand to one of the most cringe worthy rehash machine.",https://www.quora.com/Has-the-quality-of-Jackson-guitars-suffered-since-being-taken-over-by-Fender,"Spot on mate!!!! RIP the axes we loved in the 90‚Äôs Jackson, Charvel and the all mighty ( in my opinion at least) Kramer!",,,,
Ibanez Series S,"What guitar should I get as a 5'2"" woman who is a beginner? I want it to transition as I improve, so it should be something that is worth keeping.","I think if you try to buy a smaller size guitar you will end up hampering your playing in the long run. If you start out on a full size guitar you will learn how to play on it but if you start small and then buy a full size you may have to fight awkwardness feeling in your hands and fight against learned tendencies. That said I believe you should invest in a guitar that is worth something if you decide to stop playing and is also nice enough that you can be happy to play it for the rest of your life. Depending using the type of music you like really denotes the type of guitar you should buy. Here are some suggestions for what I would buy if I just started: Electric Guitars: You can‚Äôt go wrong with a Fender Stratocaster or Telecaster. They increase in value with age and are the standard instrument that most people picture when they think of a guitar. They can be used for every music style and are easily personalized. I would buy an American Standard Strat or Tele because they hold their value. You could get what you paid for it in 10 years most likely. American Fender Standard Stratocaster - $599  If you are looking for something with a little more personality then I would suggest an Ibanez S series. They are very thin and light with a very nice neck. I‚Äôve seen them used for everything from Jazz to Metal. Priced around the same as the Fenders but they are a little more unique.  As far as acoustic guitars are concerned you can‚Äôt beat a Martin guitar. They have a very simple design but are some of the most popular guitars for all genres. You will pay a bit more for it initially but it will be something you will have forever. The Martin D Jr. is around $499  Those are the guitars that I would recommend. If you have any questions or see a guitar out there and want to know what I think about it please message me, I‚Äôd be happy to help you out.",https://www.quora.com/What-guitar-should-I-get-as-a-52-woman-who-is-a-beginner-I-want-it-to-transition-as-I-improve-so-it-should-be-something-that-is-worth-keeping,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,What is the best brand of guitar for rock and metal?,"I‚Äôve been playing in metal bands for over a decade. Of course, you can play whatever guitar you like best, and that‚Äôs the only thing that matters at all. But my opinion (in order of least to most expensive) Ibanez, Schecter, PRS. My favorite guitar is an Ibanez S-series. Is got a really lightweight and thin tapered body that is super comfortable to play sitting or standing (extremely important) a locking nut, a Floyd-rose designed trem, and it‚Äôs freaking gorgeous. My first guitar was an Ibanez gio. It‚Äôs way cheaper and it was definitely sufficient for many years. I would still bring it as a backup for a gig. If you‚Äôre playing rock or metal, I also highly recommend you get a strap with a beer bottle opener like mine. Fumbling around in a messy garage for a lighter with your precious guitar strapped to your chest is a big no-no.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-brand-of-guitar-for-rock-and-metal,,,,,
Fashion 2022,What are your predictions for the 2022 FIFA World Cup?,"Here‚Äôs my list of Countries I think will qualify from each Confederation (excluding Hosts Qatar): CONCACAF (3): Mexico:  Mexico is quite obvious, they‚Äôve been significantly successful in every single World Cup Qualifier, they have great world class players and are by far the best team in the CONCACAF arena. Players to watch: Vela, Guardado, Ochoa, Dos Santos USA:  The United States had a very strong Gold Cup, after they beat teams like Trinidad and Jamaica with such confidence and ease, and only allowed 2 goals the entire Tournament, that just shows us that they are clearly behind the failure of the 2018 Qualifying stages and with the new CONCACAF qualifying rules, they‚Äôre basically guaranteed a spot. Players to watch: Pulisic, Steffen, McKennie, Zardes Costa Rica:  Teams like Honduras and Trinidad who have qualified in the past have played pretty bad in recent competitive fixtures like in the Gold Cup. If anything, Honduras will get that intercontinental playoff, but I don‚Äôt see them winning it. Costa Rica have proven themselves time and time again that they‚Äôre a World Cup team and I believe they won‚Äôt dissapoint in 2022. Players to watch: Oviedo, Ruiz, Bola√±os, Gamboa AFC (4): Korea Republic:  Korea have been the strongest Asian team thus far that I‚Äôve seen in World Cups, they fight and fight until the end no matter what, we saw that in their victory against Germany when they had almost nothing to play for, after suffering 2 losses. They have always been strong, there is no stopping this mighty group of players. Players to watch: Son, Ki, Gyu, Gwon Japan:  When I watched the Japanese almost qualify for a Knockout stage spot in the Copa America, against strong South American teams, it made it clear to me that they‚Äôre more than ready for the 2022 World Cup Campaign, and they‚Äôre gonna fight hard for that spot, but in the end they‚Äôll prevail. Players to watch: Honda, Okazaki, Inui, Nakajima Australia:  Australia are just another team that just don‚Äôt ‚Äúnot qualify‚Äù. You can always depend on them to qualify for every World Cup, they‚Äôre very organized and have great chemistry, not to mention the Premier League experience of most of their players, they‚Äôre used to this pressure and the competition. Players to watch: Mooy, Leckie, Sainsbury, Milligan Iran:  I‚Äôve never been a fan of watching the Iranians play but their road to Qatar will be fairly easy considering the Qataris themselves will not be participating in the Qualifiers so I do believe that their domination of the 2018 Qualifiers will follow into 2022, but not as strong of a result as they‚Äôd hoped for, they‚Äôll probably qualify by beating the 4th Place CONCACAF finisher in the Intercontinental playoff, who‚Äôll most likely be Honduras. Players to watch: Ghoddos, Azmoun, Dejagah, Khanzadeh CAF (5): Nigeria:  Nigeria have such a complete team with the likes of Moses, Musa and Iwobi. They are my favorite African team to watch and they never have dissapointed me in World Cup Qualifying. Unless they end up in a tough group for the last Round of qualifying, they got this in the bag. Players to watch: Moses, Musa, Iwobi, Obi Mikel Senegal:  Senegal haven‚Äôt been as good as they have been as of recently, when superstars like Man√© have carried the team on their back, literally. Their great performance in the African Cup of Nations will give them a huge surge of confidence leading up to the Qualifiers for 2022. Players to watch: Mane, Gueye, Konat√©, N‚ÄôDiaye Ghana:  You better know that Ghana is gonna be fighting for that spot after a disappointing 2018 campaign. They will be the team to watch throughout these Qualifiers, and I‚Äôm just interested to see how they cope with the pressure, but my guess is that they‚Äôll qualify but not easily, their performance in the AFCON so far is pretty good so let‚Äôs see if that carries into the 2022 Qualifiers. Players to watch: Ayew, Wakaso, Gyan, Atsu Morocco:  It just seems like whenever Morocco seem like they‚Äôre in a bad spot, they seem to pull through all the time, I‚Äôve seen that the most over their current AFCON Campaign, and I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre one of the favorites to win the competition, regardless, if they end up in the Semis, I would say they would have no problem qualifying. Players to watch: Benatia, Boussoufa, Ziyech, Idrissi Ivory Coast:  Sorry Tunisia, you just have not impressed me enough to see you guys qualifying, I was genuinely disappointed by their 2018 World Cup Performance and am now very skeptical that they‚Äôll do better than the Ivorians in the Qualifiers. Ivory Coast have improved a lot since 2018 and I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt go down without a fight. As for the Algerians, I just don‚Äôt see them qualifying this time around, either. Players to watch: Aurier, Seri, Zaha, Bony CONMEBOL (5): Brazil:  Do I even need to explain this? Of course Brazil are gonna qualify. A World Cup isn‚Äôt a World Cup without mighty Brazil. Players to watch: Neymar, Coutinho, Silva, Alisson Uruguay:  Uruguay had a dissapointing Copa Am√©rica finish this year, but what a great way to bounce back with a second place spot into the 2022 World Cup! Players to watch: Suarez, Cavani, Gimenez, Muslera Colombia:  Colombia beat Argentina in this last Copa America, they‚Äôve certainly gotten so much better, and with players like James and Falcao leading the way you best know they‚Äôre qualifying with ease in 2022. Players to watch: James, Cuadrado, Zapata, Falcao Argentina:  Argentina was disastrous and a very dramatic team last Qualifiers, all they needed was a draw or a loss, and they would‚Äôve faced elimination. They were lucky to have qualified in 2018, and I think it‚Äôll be a bit easier in 2022, but they‚Äôll still have to work for it. Players to watch: Messi, Ag√ºero, Otamendi, Lo Celso Paraguay:  Paraguay had a pretty decent Copa America, holding Brazil to 0 Goals for a whole 90 minutes with only 10 men? They were really that close to a Semifinal appearance and eliminating the Hosts. That‚Äôs not bad, and with the recent performance that Almiron has been putting on for both Club and Country, I can see him carrying this team on his back, he‚Äôs one of the fastest, if not the fastest player on the entire South American Continent, and with a killer aerial defense with the likes of Centerbacks Balbuena, Valdez and Gomez, I can see Paraguay outplaying teams like Chile and Peru and taking away that last qualifying spot from them, and of course, easily beating New Zealand in the Intercontinental playoff. All you need is Almiron, Romero and Gonzalez in the midfield and you‚Äôve got yourself a dream team. Players to watch: Almiron, Balbuena, Romero, Gonzalez UEFA (14): Germany:  Sure, they had a dissapointing 2018 Finish. But that doesn‚Äôt mean they won‚Äôt qualify in 2022 with some vengeance within them. They have a great team, great players, and great fans. No doubt they‚Äôll qualify. Players to watch: Reus, Werner, Draxler, Kimmich Belgium:  I had Belgium actually winning it all in 2018. They made it to the Semifinals and finished in 3rd Place, though, their best ever finish at a World Cup. And let‚Äôs not forget that massive comeback against Japan, which shocked most people. This team is a team that you don‚Äôt want to play in competitive matches. Players to watch: De Bruyne, Hazard, Courtois, Lukaku France:  France won the World Cup in 2018, we all know the curse that defending Champions have had going out in the Group Stage in the next World Cup. France will certainly qualify, but the question is are France cursed? Will they go out in the Group stage? Or will they end the curse once and for all? Players to watch: Greizmann, Mbapp√©, Pogba, Varane England:  The English will qualify without a problem, just are like the 3 Nation‚Äôs above them. They had a great World Cup in 2018, and I enjoy watching them play. We just wait for them to actually win a World Cup now. Players to watch: Kane, Lingard, Alli, Walker Spain:  Spain play the most amazing football I‚Äôve ever seen. They‚Äôre the most exciting team for me to watch, they seem just so brilliant and work really well together. I can see them go pretty far in 2022. Players to watch: Isco, Ramos, Asensio, Alba Portugal:  Once again, another team that interacts well together, it‚Äôs tough to think that they will not qualify, and if they do end up struggling, I see them easily winning the playoff on aggregate and qualifying that way. Ronaldo is very competitive though, and they won‚Äôt go out without a fight. Players to watch: Ronaldo, Guedes, Cancelo, Guerreiro Croatia:  Croatia surprised so many people with their amazing 2nd place finish at the 2018 World Cup. I see great things for them in 2022 World Cup Qualifying and expect them to still surprise people with their amazing talent and competitive players. Players to watch: Modriƒá, Peri≈°iƒá, Kovaƒçiƒá, Kramariƒá Switzerland:  Switzerland I think will go on as one of the 9 Group winners, in easy fashion. They played better than I expected them to be in 2018, and have some of my favorite players to watch like Shaqiri and Xhaka. Shaqiri is just so extremely fast, and they know how to use him pretty well. I see great things for them in 2022. Players to watch: Shaqiri, Xhaka, Rodriguez, Seferoviƒá Italy:  Italy finished their 2018 Campaign not qualifying for the first time since 1958, that was definitely not what they wanted and I‚Äôm expecting them to jump back and do much better in 2022. Their team is more complete now and as long as they don‚Äôt dissapoint in the Euros, I see them qualifying no problem. Players to watch: Balotelli, Insigne, Chiellini, Immobile Netherlands:  Holland also finished 2018 with a disappointing campaign, and I was quite sad to see them not qualify along with the likes of Italy, Chile, USA, and Paraguay. All of which were an inch away from qualifying in 2018. But with 2018 behind them, I know that Holland will be seeking for that spot and will stop at nothing to get it, just like the other 4 teams above that I mentioned. Players to watch: Van Dijk, Wijnaldum, Depay, Strootman Iceland:  Iceland really impressed me during the 2018 World Cup, they did pretty good considering it was their first ever appearance and being from a somewhat tiny and unpopular Country. They seem to really love their football and have many veteran players on their team, I actually can see them qualifying again, but not as easily as in 2018, they‚Äôd go through to the playoff match, and win on aggregate on away goals against Serbia. Players to watch: Sigurdsson, Gunnarsson, Bjarnason, Gudmundsson Sweden:  After seeing how much Sweden wanted to qualify in 2018, and barely beating Italy in doing so, shows just how much they care and how much confidence this team has, especially against major big teams like Italy. The fact that they went on to the knockout stages in a group including Mexico, Germany and Korea, shows just how much they can handle the pressure and can have the ability to beat big teams. Players to watch: Forsberg, Berg, Toivonen, Ekdal Wales:  I see so much potential in this young Welsh team so let‚Äôs not be surprised if they somehow end up in the 2022 World Cup. It won‚Äôt be an easy path for them, but with pacey Bale on the wing, I can definitely see them qualifying, they only qualified for one World Cup in 1958, with a quarterfinal finish. But 2022 may actually end up being their second appearance ,  but it won‚Äôt be easy at all. Players to watch: Bale, Ramsey, Davies, Allen Austria:  Austria have in recent years, surprised me in a good way, and have definitely peaked well since their disappointing 2018 Campaign, let‚Äôs just see how they do in the Euros, but they are a team I see similar to Poland in that they either won‚Äôt qualify or will comfortably qualify, it all depends on how tough their Group is.

Italian Restaurant,What is the worst dish to order at an Italian restaurant?,"Depends on which country you are dining in. In Italy I say try it all!! In the USA skip it if they are playing corny old world music, list the courses in English rather than Italian, you can smell the food only once its served. A good restaurant will advertise alluring aromas the minute you step through the door! In USA restaurants if it's not run by a 1st generation Italian dont order risotto, lasagne, whole fish or any shellfish. Oh and stay away from the Alfredo sauce its usual from a bottle or jar with the consistency of glue. Nor is ‚ÄúAlfredo sauce‚Äù actually Italian.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-worst-dish-to-order-at-an-Italian-restaurant,Not to mention that ‚ÄúAlfredo‚Äù isn‚Äôt really Italian.,,,,

Italian Restaurant,"What is your favorite Italian restaurant in the Boston, Massachusetts area?","There are many great Italian restaurants in Boston. Probably the best is Mama Maria‚Äôs in the North End. This rare restaurant has everything. It‚Äôs in a quiet historic neighborhood across from the house of Paul Revere. The food is outstanding in every way. The restaurant is cozy with tiny, cozy rooms, decorated in old world style. Unlike most restaurants in the North End, Mama Maria‚Äôs takes credit cards and has easy valet parking. It‚Äôs the perfect experience. On the downside it‚Äôs incredibly expensive. My go-to restaurant for Italian is Giacomos on Hanover St. here‚Äôs a hint. If you want to know the good places then look for the ones with long lines during the off periods. A place that people are waiting to get into is usually good. Now here‚Äôs some advice. Despite the truly excellent Italian seafood dishes and a menu of staggering proportions this is not the place to go in the summer. The place packs you in like sardines and THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING. The experience is ruined. Don‚Äôt go here on a date. There‚Äôs no privacy. And they only take cash. They have the food and the charm but you really have to put up with a lot to get it. On the plus side it‚Äôs right next to a liquor store so you can get a bottle in a bag and make a little party with strangers while you wait to get in. Lately I‚Äôve been enjoying Carmelina‚Äôs on Hanover. It‚Äôs not special except for a dish they call ‚ÄúCrazy Alfredo‚Äù that I can‚Äôt seem to get enough of. It‚Äôs a great place for a date because even if you have to wait they give you a pager and you go across the street to Cafe Vitroria for a sambucca and cappuccino while you wait in comfort. The cafe is my all time favorite venue in Boston and Boston‚Äôs oldest coffee shop. Best cappuccino outside Italy. I forgot to mention that Carmelina‚Äôs hires the hottest, large breasted waitresses in the city. They are sweet and exotic. Bricco is currently the ‚Äúhip‚Äù Italian place. If you have money to blow and are staying in the city check out Bricco Suites. It‚Äôs a boutique hotel hidden down an alley and really special. Briccos has its own bakery, Italian grocery store and a chic restaurant with a fire pit at every table. Worth the visit. Now for pizza many people will tell you Regina‚Äôs is the place to go and if you want the traditional Boston experience this is the place to go. But Santarpios pizza in Eastie just after the tunnel is better. The place is a hole, a 60s era leftover but their corn-meal crust pizza is the best pizza anywhere. Choosing best pizza is often a religious argument but it always comes down to Regina‚Äôs or Santarpios. You should never leave the airport without stopping to pick up a surprisingly cheap and yet perfect Santarpios pizza. For Italian pastry you have to go to Modern Pastry on Hanover. They are the secret pastry supplier to most of the Italian cafes in the city and their stuff is legendary. The atmosphere is terrible and the place is crowded but your friends will be delighted when you show up with a string-tied box from Modern. Avoid Mike‚Äôs Pastry.

Presidential Election,What was the most significant Presidential election in American history?,"This is a great question. I would rank the most significant elections this way..
1. Washington.  He got the USA off to a great start and, most importantly, actually set a precedent for transferring power.
2. Lincoln.  For obvious reasons.
3. FDR in 1932.  Dramatically changed the role of government involvement in the economy, for better or worse.
4. Reagan in 1980.  The most transformative conservative presidency ever.
5. Obama in 2008.  En route to being the most transformative progressive presidency ever, plus the obvious symbolic and race issues of his election.  Massive expansion of the government from 20 percent to 24 percent of GDP (a 20 percent rise) in three years.  A new course, for better or worse. People can disagree on whether they are pro or con on the policy choices of these leaders.  But all definitely changed the direction (or set it initially in Washington's case) of the ship of state. Johnson would have made this list at number five if Obama were excluded (because Obama's term in still underway).  Truman might have made the list, too.. JFK would have had a case.. And W. would have had a case because he so changed America's foreign policy commitments and entanglements (again, for better or worse).. Keep in mind, too, just how hotly contested the 2000 Bush vs. Gore race was.. It took 39 days after the election for the Supreme Court to rule in the case! Just because Bush is not popular today does not mean his election was not hugely significant.. For both the 9.11 attacks and the 2008 economic crisis were absolutely significant (bad) events.. Clinton would also make the back half of the top 10 somewhere.  And Jefferson has to make the list, too.  The Lousiana Purchase was a bit of a big deal, to say nothing of his brilliant statesmanship, personal marital issues notwithstanding. Just my two cents.

Presidential Election,Can current presidents vote in the presidential election?,"Absolutely.  In fact, it's a given that every four years, on election day, one of the almost mandatory camera shots of the election will be the current President casting their ballot, generally ""back home"" where they lived before becoming President (Washington DC is considered a temporary home for the President, so they are not obligated to switch registrations). Likewise, you will see a shot of the candidates in the race (if the President is not running for reelection) casting their ballots at their home precinct, surrounded by cameras, before (traditionally) retreating to their Headquarters to monitor the results as they come in.",https://www.quora.com/Can-current-presidents-vote-in-the-presidential-election,,,,,
Presidential Election,Which candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election do you support?,"John Kasich. I love competence. I really like experience. I believe in center-right economic policy, and a civil liberties (NOT progressive) oriented center-left social policy. John Kasich checks three out of four. The only one he doesn't check (the last), he's made a relatively small part of his platform, telling us while he may not like it personally, he has no policy beef with gay marriage. He doesn't waste time harping about how we need to deport everyone. He doesn't sink to bigotry against Muslims. I may disagree with some of his positions, but he's made it clear his focus is fiscal and foreign policy, which I agree with. His policy proposals are realistic. So, that's why I support him relative to the other Republicans. On the Democratic side, listening to Sanders speak about the economy (as an Economist) makes me understand how it must feel to be a women's health professional listening to Todd Akin talk about ""legitimate rape."" So he's out, even though I know he is a genuine and well-intentioned guy. Hillary, while I don't feel her economic policy would end up being nearly as far to the left as she's portraying (a plus to me), doesn't give me the impression she has the skills/charisma to lead. While I know some of her pile of scandals are being overexposed due to politics, the sheer quantity of them (notwithstanding the weak dismissals of them from her supporters) leads me to have little faith in her trustworthiness. It's tough to point to accomplishments in her ""experiences"" that would make me consider it a plus (at least relative to Kasich). I grew up and did my undergrad in Ohio. I know several people who worked on Kasich's first gubernatorial campaign, and they have nothing but good things to say about who he is behind closed doors. I love what he's done in Ohio. He's been great for jobs, gets how to balance a budget, understands economic policy, and knows more than anyone in the race about the congressional process.  The kicker: he conducts himself in a way that makes me think I can trust him with the nuclear codes. That has me on board.

Presidential Election,Can Donald Trump still win the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?,"According to all the outdated newspapermen, and all the outdated polling methods, and as constantly aserted on all the outdated offline TV programs ‚Äî Clinton is in the lead by a long margin. Don‚Äôt make me laugh. Where are the people still reading newspapers? Or do they now read online from places like Google News?  Because the numbers of people searching for Trump on Google News are Three Times that of Clinton. And are people really answering the phone to give accurate polling information, or should we look at what they‚Äôre searching for on the internet as a more honest poll?  Because the number of internet searches on ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù outweigh ‚ÄúClinton‚Äù by two to one. And are people really sitting in front of the TV news being told what to believe any more, or are they going to YouTube and making their own minds up?  Because almost  FOUR TIMES  the number of searches on YouTube are for ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù than ‚ÄúClinton‚Äù. So it seems pretty clear to me. People are more interested in Donald Trump news. They are more interested in Donald Trump information. And they are more interested in seeing and hearing about Donald Trump.  By a long, long way. Which, I think, translates into a Trump win in the US election on November 8th. But there are even more reliable statistics. People who care about politics, and are likely to vote, are going to read books or ebooks. Most books in the US are sold through Amazon.com, and that website ranks books according to popularity. So let‚Äôs look at the rank of the most popular Trump book:  It‚Äôs at  no 188  in the book chart. That‚Äôs pretty good. So let‚Äôs look at the bestselling book about Hillary Clinton, and compare it‚Äôs rank.  Oh‚Ä¶ This one‚Äôs at  no 247 . So, not only is the bestselling book about Trump more popular than the bestselling book about Clinton. The one about Clinton is, well, not too flattering to say the least. Now before I carry on, may I say that I am not political. So the following analysis is simply following where the rabbit hole goes, so to speak. Like you, I‚Äôd really quite like to know whereabouts in the Amazon rankings the first positive book about Hillary Clinton is. So here‚Äôs the list, taken simply from an Amazon search for ‚ÄúClinton‚Äù in the title, ordered by Popularity. Guilty as Sin: Uncovering New Evidence of Corruption and How Hillary Clinton and the Democrats Derailed the FBI Investigation: Edward Klein: 9781621576419 Clinton Cash: A Graphic Novel: Chuck Dixon, Brett R. Smith, Peter Schweizer: 9781621575450 Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich: Peter Schweizer: 9780062369291 The Clintons' War on Women: Roger Stone, Robert Morrow: 9781510713925 Partners in Crime: The Clintons' Scheme to Monetize the White House for Personal Profit: Jerome Corsi: 9781944229337 Hillary Rodham Clinton: Some Girls Are Born to Lead: Michelle Markel, LeUyen Pham: 9780062381224s So there we have it eventually at number 6 in the list. But aren‚Äôt those first five a chilling barometer of the country‚Äôs feeling about the Clintons?  I have to say, this one doesn‚Äôt look  that  hard hitting, but let‚Äôs give it the benefit of the doubt. It‚Äôs at  no 4319 , and because Amazon‚Äôs sales rankings are logarithmic (disproportionate sales numbers for the first few bestsellers), it means Hillary‚Äôs bestselling ‚Äúpositive‚Äù book is selling perhaps 10 copies a week to Trump‚Äôs 1000 per week. And that‚Äôs the biggest ratio we‚Äôve seen yet ‚Äî 100 to 1. I used to commission books for a publisher. I had to rely on online data like this to pitch book ideas to my boss, who wanted to know whether a book idea, or an author, would be popular enough to invest money in. These stats were usually right. Google Trends and Amazon ranks were usually always right. I‚Äôve bet tens of thousands of my publisher‚Äôs dollars on that, and he gained a tasty return on investment. If I were looking to commission a political book right now, I might do one or two positive ones on Trump. People obviously want that. I would do some negative ones on Clinton. People obviously want that too. What Americans don‚Äôt want, and what I wouldn‚Äôt bet my publishers money on, is a positive book about Clinton. What does that say about November 8th?",https://www.quora.com/Can-Donald-Trump-still-win-the-2016-U-S-Presidential-Election,"Well, just because people find it more difficult to look away from a train wreck than a blank t.v. screen doesn't mean they like what they see.","It is difficult to believe that such an unscientific claim that Google searches correlate to election results.

Romney led in search volume 2.7:1 for the entire year and as much as 5.7:1 in the last week of August.

Ibanez Series S,What do you think of people who buy Japanese copies of Fender and Gibson guitars?,"Firslty, we should point out that one of the best grand pianos you can buy are in fact Yamaha. They are in a climate controlled environment and not a single person touches skin to instrument during the building process. Their quality control is exceptional as well. Perfectionists. Japanese guitars are exceptional in reality,  Ibanez  for instance. Joe Satriani, Paul Gilber, Steve Vai, that dude from Korn etc all use Ibanez. I used Ibanez and they are very high performence guitars. But, no two manufacturers are alike so play the guitar before buying. Ibanez actually used to make a series of guitars in the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs I believe that were dubbed the ‚ÄúLawsuit Guitars‚Äù due to the fact that Gibson actually sued them as the guitar was such a 1:1 copy and the quality was up there with the best. They are hard to find but my mate has one and it‚Äôs very,  very  good. Normally what you‚Äôll find is that guitar quality from region can vaugely be broken down into this ranking (It‚Äôs not a science, just how you tend to skim it for  mass produced ); USA made and Japanese made Korean made Everything else There are always exceptions to this rule, I myself have a Californian made Fender Stratocaster and I‚Äôve had to do so much work on it to get the tuning stable due to a badly filed nut from the factory and then a badly filed nut from a luthier (Hence why I became skilled in repair). Yamaha do make a decent set of stratolikes in the Pacifica model I believe. Played one once and it was a very comfortable guitar. Other asian markets are hit and miss at best, my friend bought a chinese guitar as his first guitar (Stratocaster copy) and where they had cut the bridge hole into the wrong area, rather than get another body they hacksawed the pickguard which led to many engineering issues with the guitar‚Ä¶. Rather than buy for a look (Les Paul, Stratocaster, etc) I‚Äôd recommend any first time buyers going to a guitar center and sitting down with a few of the cheaper guitars. Look on the back of the head stock and take note of where each was made. Get a feel for what sort of neck shape suits you and find what is comfortable for both standing and sitting playing (EG, Flying V‚Äôs look cool, but I could never get on with the shape as the BC Rich one I played was very neck heavy and the V just wanted to point  upwards). Otherwise,  Japanese guitars are like Japanese motorcycles, they just keep on riding and most (Ibanez, I‚Äôm looking at you) are blisteringly fast!",https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-people-who-buy-Japanese-copies-of-Fender-and-Gibson-guitars,Upvote simply for ‚Äúthat dude from Korn‚Äù!

Presidential Election,Is there concrete evidence of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election?,"You could make a circumstantial argument that goes something like: Pollsters almost universally predicted a big win for Biden, but his win was fairly narrow, therefore Republicans must have engaged in fraud, just not enough to win. Another argument goes: Studies have shown that historically fraud in US elections ranges from 0.0003% to 0.0025%; therefore, we would expect the same level of fraud in 2020. Or: 150,000 ballots were found in post offices undelivered the morning after the election; that couldn‚Äôt have happened by chance. Since most mail ballots are for Biden, it must be the Republicans. I know of two credible charges of fraud in 2020, neither of which involved a successful fraudulent vote. There are lots of conspiracy theories and lots of videos from people who allegedly engaged in or saw fraud, but there‚Äôs no evidence that these folks are telling the truth, particularly since money has been offered for such stories. The one sworn statement from a postal worker in Pennsylvania was retracted. There are people who look at charts of data and say ‚Äúthat can‚Äôt be right,‚Äù but they‚Äôre not qualified to know what‚Äôs anomalous, and they don‚Äôt look for simpler alternative explanations (that‚Äôs why they are not being scientific). At least some of the alleged dead voters turned up alive, saved by a clerical error. I suspect most of the rest of them will be found based on prior investigations of dead voters. Some claimed they saw workers in the Georgia hand recount put Trump voters in the Biden pile ‚Äî but couldn‚Äôt explain how they just happened to come up with the same totals as the machiners. If someone is looking for proof that reptoids under the North Pole are twiddling dials on a supercomputer and flipping votes in the United States, I‚Äôm afraid they will be disappointed. (And no, I didn‚Äôt make that up.) If there were any evidence of widespread fraud sufficient to make the slightest difference in the 2020 election, the Trump Campaign would be presenting it in court, rather than admitting they don‚Äôt have any, withdrawing lawsuits, and not proving anything. Seriously, what is some individual on the Internet going to find that Trump‚Äôs lawyers don‚Äôt know about? I wish I had a more substantive answer, but the Internet rumors of fraud are themselves not substantive. I‚Äôve put together a collection of fraud stories in my Quora space. The Election Fraud Fraud",https://www.quora.com/Is-there-concrete-evidence-of-fraud-in-the-2020-US-presidential-election,"Actually seeing the posts from Trump supporters its pretty clear what strategy they are endorsing- all some form of rejecting all votes in several states- literally taking away the votes of millions of Americans- so that the vote would go to the House. The ‚Äòfraud‚Äô stuff is just a front for finding their expectation that there are enough ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù judges out there that some of them will go along with Trump‚Äôs subversion of our electoral system, and have the House- not the Electoral College decide.","Then again there are more polls. Trump began his term at 47% or 49%, then scored a dismal 40% approval rating by every single credible source for the next 4 years. It‚Äôs hard to get re-elected on that. Now, after the election Biden enjoys a consistent 59% approval rating. Had those ballots been been rigged, the scores would be different. Some think that Trump‚Äôs failure must have been his response to covid. Untrue! His base remained loyal. It never flagged. The rest of America, Democrats, disgruntled Republicans, and independents genuinely hated him long before then. In the end Trump ignored ‚Äúthe rule of spades‚Äù which says, ‚ÄúWhen you find yourself in a hole, put down the shovel.‚Äù Narcissist that he was, he continued to double down his own failures, never admitting he was wrong. And so we have those constant insults on Twitter, those 30,000 lies no one ever believed. His loss was entirely his own. He never accepted it either. His ego was just too big. Maybe that also speaks for his own radical right wing nut base who needed to believe in him and never, ever admit they could be wrong. The hardest thing for them to understand is that nobody believes them either. Come election time the people simply decided. They prefered reason, science, and law. His still loyal base treats us the same way Trump did, calling us names like RINO, Liberal, Socialist, Communist, and Leftist as they raided the capitol trying to stop the vote. And when that failed, when Trump finally left the white house with a record low 29%, they blamed Antifa and BLM. Now they want to suppress the vote.",You can present the same question about any election and the answer would be that fraud is typically low. I have run for local elections and could have debated the results because they were so close but I accepted the loss and wins. This 2020 election was blown up more because SOME people did not like the outcome. Attempting to remove valid votes from certain communities was fraud within itself.,What about the Romney/Obama election? Anonymous claimed they hacked the voting system and switched votes from Romney back to Obama in Ohio. Why wasn‚Äôt there an investigation? Where was all the screaming of election fraud by the Republicans then? A infamous group of hackers claimed to switch votes from their candidate to the other. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Romney's son bought the electronic voting machine company in Ohio and maybe an investigation would show a vote manipulation on their side and Anonymous did put the votes back.,"So then how do you react to stories such as these? Georgia Recount Witnesses Saw Trump Votes Counted for Biden https://bongino.com/sidney-powell-weve-identified-450000-ballots-cast-for-joe-biden-only-no-down-ballot-candidates/?utm_source=ground.news&utm_medium=referral What‚Äôs interesting is that while I was comparing articles for the second story linked above, I found some discussions going on under the article itself.

Fashion 2022,What is the most dramatic change in the new 2022 Formula 1 car?,"So the current rule book gets thrown out and a whole lot of new regulations come into effect from 2022 onwards. Basically everything is changing, from the power units through to the size of the tyres. But the most dramatic change is F1‚Äôs efforts to reduce the turbulence which the current cars create in their wake:  All of that turbulence means passing becomes a problem as any car trying to pass a car in front has to deal with it. Consequentially the car behind becomes unsettled and, given F1 cars require good airflow for the essential downforce to keep them from flying off the track, as a result the car behind can‚Äôt push the advantage to pass. As a result the 2022 cars will look different. How different? Well that‚Äôs a good question, but the changes will include winglets around/over the front wheels. Also the rear spoiler will look drastically different and sit lower than currently. The front wing will be of a simpler design, also with winglets, and the nose will change as well. Another feature will include good old fashioned side skirts seen here on the Williams:  Now they‚Äôll be a very different design, than just having part of the car drag along the road like they used to, but again it is part of F1‚Äôs attempt to reduce the turbulence, because with the changes with the wings, spoilers, diffusers, and so forth, they‚Äôre going to be losing a fair amount of downforce. So apart from regaining some grip through mechanical efforts, whether it be via the new 18 inch wheels &/or suspension components, the car will be allowed ground effect technology as well.

Italian Restaurant,Why is it considered socially unacceptable to order pizza at an Italian restaurant?,"It‚Äôs isn‚Äôt socially wrong, but you will not be served pizza in a restaurant. Why? Because a restaurant isn‚Äôt a  pizzeria .  Pizzeria Gorizia in Naples Pizza is served in  pizzerie , specialized eateries that are equipped to make pizza. Pizza isn‚Äôt made in the kitchen, indeed  the pizza oven can‚Äôt be legally placed in the same room that hosts the kitchen  (if you have a house that can host a pizza oven you can place it wherever you want, but you can‚Äôt place it in a restaurant kitchen) and must be instead be housed in a separate environment. It is located in plain sight in the main room of the pizzeria, in a semi-enclosed corner that leaves it visible but not accessible. Most commonly traditional  pizzerie  only serve pizza.  Resturant Giannino dal 1889, Milan  Tuna tartare by Giannino dal 1889 In Italian a restaurant isn‚Äôt generally speaking an eatery. It‚Äôs specifically a relatively high-standards restaurant that serves food cooked on premises and with an accent of dishes made espresso and on good presentation.  Trattoria Sabbioneda, Milan  Brasato e polenta from Trattoria Sabbioneda Trattoria  is a cheaper type of restaurant that still serves food cooked on the premises, but with an accent on home-style cuisine, simpler dishes which are presented not differently from what would be done in an Italian family. Another cheap restaurant is a traditional  osteria , which used to be a place that mainly served wine with a few dishes to accompany them, but in recent years the word ‚Äú osteria ‚Äù has been taken over by posh restaurants. Usually neither restaurants nor  trattoria  have a pizza oven, but sometimes you can find a place that has both a kitchen and a pizza oven, obviously housed in separate parts of the restaurant. In this case you have a  ristorante pizzeria  or a  pizzeria con cucina .  Dehors in the center of Milan In no cases order pizza from a place where you can‚Äôt see the oven. A common sight is tourists eating pizza  al fresco  (which in English has come to mean eating outside, but in Italian means ‚Äúin jail‚Äù) in the center of Milano, sitting outside places that to them may look like restaurants, but are usually  tavola fredda . A  tavola fredda  is a bar-type place with a section devoted to preparing panini, tramezzini, piadine, and to reheating frozen dishes. A  tavola fredda  does not have a proper kitchen, so if you happen to ask for a pizza from there you are commonly served a frozen pizza.  Never order pizza in Italy from a place that does not clearly display the pizza oven in its main room. You will just be served something you could buy for a few euro in any supermarket and reheat at home.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-considered-socially-unacceptable-to-order-pizza-at-an-Italian-restaurant,"This must be a ‚Äòreal Italy‚Äô type of thing - in the Northeast USA, which is the capital of Italian cooking and Italian restaurants across the globe, outside of Italy itself, Italian Restaurants are literally judged on their pizza quality.

Presidential Election,What were the most controversial Presidential elections in American history?,"I'm surprised no one else has said it, but... The election of 1860. The candidates were as follows:
 Abraham Lincoln, of the Republican Party Stephen Douglas, of the Northern Democrats John Breckinridge, of the Southern Democrats John Bell, of the Constitutional Unionists

The Democrats were so thoroughly divided on the issue of slavery that at the Democratic convention of 1860 held in Charleston, South Carolina, delegates from 8 Southern states walked out of the convention in protest of the fact that the convention could not agree to adopt a platform that included congressional protections for slavery in the territories.  Not coincidentally, 7 of these 8 states would be the first 7 states of the Confederacy.  The Constitutional Unionists would be formed out of a fervent desire to keep the Union whole, as it was sensed (correctly) by many that its very existence was in danger with the possibility of the election of a Republican president. While Breckinridge and Lincoln had largely sectional (and hence partisan) appeal, Bell and his party tried to rally bisectional support in order to preserve the Union.  Abraham Lincoln didn't even campaign in the South. In some states his name wasn't even on the ballot, and he ultimately got only 3% of the Southern vote (no electoral votes, of course). You could make an argument that there was essentially two elections going on in the country at the time: Douglas vs. Lincoln in the North, and Breckinridge vs. Bell in the South. Some states also adopted a ""fusionist"" ticket, which combined Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge into one candidate for the presidency in hopes of throwing the election into the House of Representatives (since undecided elections are determined by the House).  Anyway, 7 states were so dissatisfied with the ultimate winner of the election (Abraham Lincoln, who had shown it is possible to win a presidential race with just 39% of the popular vote) that they left the Union and formed their own government.  4 more states would later join them after this newly elected president issued a call for 75,000 volunteers to quash the rebellion. The gist of it is was that with the election of a president who belonged to the Republican party, they thought that slavery would be in danger. This is despite the fact that Lincoln was relatively moderate compared to others in his party on the slavery issue, this ultimately made little difference to the South.  The resulting war would eventually claim the lives of 620,000 men. The war would also leave us with our first assassinated president and the abolition of slavery (13th amendment). Not to mention Reconstruction which followed shortly afterward.
In my view, no other election comes close in terms of consequences for the nation. Some may argue that the Civil War was a foregone conclusion, but that doesn't change the fact that it was the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency in 1860 that precipitated the secession crisis which then resulted in war. Hence, the election of 1860 was the most controversial presidential election in U.S. history.",https://www.quora.com/What-were-the-most-controversial-Presidential-elections-in-American-history,A unified Democratic slate would have changed only California's and Oregon's electoral votes.,"I wish the ""promote"" function still existed.
Your answer deserves it.","Just an addition or two: 1) The California Democrats walked out of the 1860 Convention, too. Not many people know that CA was a border state, demographically, which had been under the control of the ""Chivalry"" (Southern Dems) since statehood in 1850. 2) Lincoln was committed to non-interference with slavery within the South and could be correctly described as a moderate. The Republican platform, however, was strongly anti-slavery, so the South was reacting as much to the Republican victory as to Lincoln, per se. Best description of Secession I ever heard: a ""pre-emptive counter-revolution.""","Great answer. At the start, I said, of course, he's right, and then you went on to make the case.",I suggest the book  Team of Rivals  if people would like to read more about the election of 1860.

Presidential Election,How can intelligent people not see that Donald Trump will win the 2016 U.S. Presidential election?,"Thanks for the A2A - But I am sorry, I have to go a bit negative here - What are you  talking  about?? First, there are far more reasons (and pretty much everyone has explained them well so I won't rehash) why Trump  won't  likely win the election than why he would.  Intelligence has nothing to do with it - perhaps wisdom is more appropriate.   As for the comment of your question - please- I can only assume you are trolling for negative comments.  Since when was the American Dream limited to those with Charisma?  Or the wealthy? Or the famous?  And I'm sorry but we are all ""free"".  As for being a winner, that is  far  from determined.  But that would be the only criteria that I think you mentioned that  might  validly describe achieving the ""American Dream"". The American Dream means that America is a land of opportunity, were anyone has the equal opportunity to reach their goals of (if I could mix metaphors) follow their dreams.   A poor anti-social man programs an app that can change the world, and a mega-corporation buys that App for half a billion dollars- THAT'S the American Dream.   An immigrant comes to America and uses his last pennies to buy a meal on wheels and it becomes the hottest place in town and is soon franchised into a business - THAT'S the American Dream.  A couple give birth to an only child who they love and cherish and provide for though they have so little - and that Child takes every chance they can to learn and grow and fight for every opportunity they can, goes to Harvard and gets voted the President of the Law Review and then, someday, becomes the First African American President in the History of the United States.  That's the American Dream.  Being born into money and power, misusing that money, declaring bankruptcy multiple times, getting multiple divorces and not investing your money properly, then using your power and influence to tease and bully your opposition while somehow convincing a percentage of conservatives that you are so anti-establishment that they should vote you to become the US President while you promise impossible changes and impractical solutions.  That's not the American Dream - That's being popular and lucky.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Web Crawlers:  What are the specific copyright laws for crawling websites?,"I'm going to address several of thing you commented on. First, income (via ad revenue or anything else) is  not a factor  in copyright infringement. So it does not matter if Blizzard makes money off of the original content, if the scrappers make money off the copied content, or if everyone is in this for free. What constitutes copyright infringement is really simple: making a copy of an original work without permission. Now then, some things cannot be copyrighted, and there is a ""workaround"" in US copyright law (only the US) called ""Fair Use"". These complicate the picture, but not as much as you think. When talking about whether something can actually be copyrighted, the question is whether it is an original work. Facts are not ""original"". So the arena ladders, if listed as stats and not as florid prose, are probably not protected by copyright. (Just like the list of planets in the solar system can't be copyrighted, because it is just a list of facts.) Fair Use  is concerned with some limited ways to use some part of a copyrighted work, mostly for discussing the whole (book or movie review) or to critique it or make some other comments about the material you copy a snippet from. It does not (usually) allow you to copy the whole thing, nor to do so without writing your own work that this is just a part of. Probably not relevant here, but I wanted you to understand it. In the end, the simple rule of copyright needs a lot of lawyer advice because of these two big complications. The specifics on what the website actually copies and what else is written on these pages make a big difference in whether a judge would rule in favor of Blizzard or the website. But remember, none of this is a protection from getting a cease-and-desist letter or a full lawsuit. These are only distinctions that are important once the case has actually gone to court.",https://www.quora.com/Web-Crawlers-What-are-the-specific-copyright-laws-for-crawling-websites,,,,,

Blizzard Lawsuit,Why are INTJs rarely spiritual?,"I will offer a simple response that is likely to trigger endless retorts from the religious community. I personally see a huge difference between spirituality and religion. Feeling the blissful warmth of the sunshine, hearing the birds chirp, and smelling the scent of nature in the midst of spring bloom is an absolutely spiritual experience. It's invigorating. Life is spiritual. The birth of new life is spiritual. But, I draw that line at religion. Too many contradictions. Those who are religious have far too many convenient crutches that they cling to in futile efforts to explain away all the negatives of the world. I can't overlook the amount of death, hostility, oppression, greed, and despair that has been inflicted on the people of the planet simply for the ruthless expansion of their chosen faith. ‚ÄúI will beat you to death to prove how pure, good, wholesome, and holy I am.. and you will thank me for it! Not only that, you will sacrifice your own resources to serve me for eternity.‚Äù I just can't see the point? The same entity being praised for all the ‚Äòmiracles‚Äô is the exact same entity responsible for whatever transpired to create the desperate need for a ‚Äòmiracle‚Äô. How many times have I seen a news broadcast where there is a witness account after a natural disaster with somebody all too happy to praise God for saving them. Who created the floods, the volcanoes, the earthquakes, the tsunamis, the hurricanes, the blizzards? The same creator who is being worshipped for sparing them! At whos expense? Their loved ones? Their peers? Their neighborhood? Their trivial possessions? Their religious rivals? It's all so distasteful to me. Rather similar to the modern day government agenda of generating fear, for the sake of offering protection, merely for the profit to be gained in the process.. while systematically trampling the Constitution in the process. God created disease and famine so that those who don't suffer such afflictions will be thankful and say they are blessed? That is beyond sick. I'm just not that gullible. There are too many religions all fighting each other for power and prestige in an effort to spread, with no regard for the damage done in the process. Easily forgiven because it's for a righteous cause. Speaking for myself? Spiritual? Definitely. Religious? Nope. No interest. None at all. But, what about  ‚Äòthe afterlife'?! Given the life I've had this time around, I'll take my chances and accept the consequences. Oh, let me guess.. If only I was a believer, I would have nothing to worry about, right? How convenient. The idea that I can do whatever I want with no fear of due consequence, tithe appropriately while confessing my sins on Sunday, and start my week on Monday with a clean slate of morality? Odd as it may be, I can turn the simple task of cooking a decent breakfast into a spiritual experience. I welcome that. But.. Religion is beyond delusional to me. So, now let me backtrack a little bit here and also say that I have no problem at all with anybody who wishes to claim any religious faith as their own. That is their personal choice. I respect that. The only condition being that they respect my choice as well. The problem is that religion does not allow for personal freedom. Must recruit. Must expand! While millions die everyday of poverty and disease, the Vatican needs another layer of gold plating on their toilet seats and the lawsuit trust fund is dwindling! I can't seem to reconcile the atrocities of such an imbalanced equasion in my logic driven mind. Spirituality is all about personal freedom. Be who you want. Believe what you want. Find beauty in obscure things. Answer to nobody. Self defined. Continuity in place of an endless cycle of filth and cleansing. Perfect for me. I build invisible walls to protect my spirituality from the destructive influence of religion. Such irony! Early personality profiling theory states that INTJs are guided by mystical intuition that leads them to subconsciously piece together scattered details in order to predict potential future outcomes. They are Seers. Shamanistic visionaries. They have a tendency to often instinctively know things for reasons even they can't begin to explain. Mentally, they follow whatever hunch evolves from within to examine where that path may lead. Despite often being told they have no heart and no soul, the truth is simply that they reserve it to be slowly exposed, only for those they deem worthy. If that isn't spiritual, I don't know what is.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-INTJs-rarely-spiritual,"Probably one of a few INTJs in the comment who‚Äôs having a religion. Not trying to argue with you though, because I agree. There are so many people using their religions to fit their ego. Even my religion. Though as I am now having religion not because people telling me so or because it‚Äôs a popular belief. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôve seen and read things. Most of the things I‚Äôve read make sense, to me at least, why should we do things and why we do not. Contradictions has its way to people but I just trust my guts, I guess. For now. So I guess, I‚Äôll stay having a religion until the peak of my logic said otherwise.","I‚Äôm a borderline INTJ/ISTJ but I think I understand some of what you‚Äôre saying. It sounds like something I would say. I love definitions, and to have things in categories that help me understand both them and myself. The problem is that those categorizations build those invisible walls that you described and I have often found that the definitions limit me, not the thing I thought they enclosed. I think you understand that because you mentioned the irony of building invisible walls to protect yourself from religion. My question to you seems (to me) to be a fitting one for an INTJ to consider: Have you truly examined the spiritual basis for the religions or are you relying on secondary sources and evidence viewed from an extreme distance? Some religions, and some expressions of religions are cages, but some are not. If you close your mind away from any religious experience, you may be closing your mind away from spiritual truth, building prisons in your own mind.","Religions are founded by individuals who embody and teach great spiritual insights into the nature of humanity and the world that are far far deeper than the garden variety appreciation of flowers and birds. Naturally, they want to share what they know, so they attract students (disciples) to whom they impart their wisdom; and since the teacher not only speaks his truth but also embodies it, his students EXPERIENCE his words, not just as concepts, but as reality. After the teacher has passed on, his students continue to spread his teachings, and over time, this activity expands into a religion, in which the original spiritual insights and path are transformed into a system of outward observances. Meanwhile, the living experience of the teacher‚Äôs spiritual truth is either restricted to small groups within the religion, or lost completely. An example of the first might be the Sufi sects within Islam; the second is exemplified by Christianity. Because the Christian religion formed in the West, it received the full brunt of the European Enlightenment and scientific progress. As a result, the mystical core of the religion was all but snuffed out. But globalization has spread the same Enlightenment values and scientific technologies to the rest of the world, where it is eating away at the foundations of every other religion and spiritual tradition on the planet. Important gains have been made through scientific knowledge, but the loss of understanding into the nature of humanity and the world has been equally great. Religions preserve the keys to profound insights in symbolical form, long after they are no longer understood and practiced. You would never know it from listening to the gibberish that comes out of the mouths of many Christians, but the core of the faith contains the most profound spiritual insights imaginable. Yet they are only accessible once the outward form of the religion is disposed of. Only then can we hear Jesus speak to us directly without the accretion of two thousand years worth of dogmas and distortions. As an introduction to what it is really about I recommend an open-minded reading of the Gospel of John, which opens with one of the most profound verses ever written:
‚ÄúIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God‚Äù.","Well spoken. As an INTJ myself I am highly spiritual but I dislike religion. My mom is considered a shaman in our respected believes in our country, she often shoves her believe in ‚Äúmiracles and irrational superstitions‚Äù to me. Both of us are highly spiritual but me as an INTJ is always trying to find the bridges between magic and superstition to science. Needless to say that we argue a lot.","I agree on a lot of points. Not that all people abuse religion and use it to hurt others, but there are a number who do. I have met some true believers, who you'd might expect to condemn me for living in sin for a few years before marrying my husband, but who, at the church raffle, actually gave me a bunch of stuff they won for our new kitchen. (I was raised Catholic and the raffle was put on by the church I grew up with.) They also knew my now husband, then boyfriend, is Hindu. Father didn't even comment on it. But, there are others, who abuse it. Like the day I came into work wearing my engagement ring, people wanted to see and naturally, wedding plans came up, which we hadn't yet decided- what did I get asked? How the Catholic church felt about me living in sin for years. Lol. Just to hurt me and embarrass me in front of others and rain on my parade. And the person who brought it up wasn't even Catholic. But, the joke is on them. No one had cared about that. They were happy for me. Also, it wouldn't matter to me what the church thought. I was at that raffle to hang with my grandparent's friends. My grandparents had already passed, but these were the people who made a difference in their lives during their final years. I had stopped going to mass 10 years prior, but would attend some church related things with my grandparents, to spend time with them."
Blizzard Lawsuit,Can a blizzard shut down private servers?,"Private server is just a computer located somewhere. So yes, heavy snowfall can disrupt infrastructure in the area, damaging power lines or internet lines, and causing that computer to become offline.

Blizzard Lawsuit,"Has anyone ever won a lawsuit against a landlord? If so, how so, and what was the reason?","I lived in a high rise building on the tenth floor, which had a nice brass and glass mail chute running on all floors down to the USPS mailbox in the lobby. One day, I mail out my bills, including my rent, all down the chute. Then the late payment and eviction notices start to show up. A neighbor on a lower floor posts a notice in the elevators warning of the blockage of mail on the second to third floors! I call the local post office, which informs me that a landlord is responsible to maintain mail chutes, and that there is a master key for each floor‚Äôs brass panel to swing the glass and everything else asid to clear jams. Replacement keys are easy to obtain at any locksmith. I write the local post office with Polaroid‚Äôs of the mail jam, asking them to confirm that repair of the situation is the landlord‚Äôs responsibility. as ‚Äòmail chutes‚Äô are not USPS property and they are not allowed to touch or repair them. I also don‚Äôt write a replacement check, as I‚Äôve already been sued for eviction, explained the situation to the landlord‚Äôs law firm, and they say they won‚Äôt accept late payment, or even current ongoing payments; they just want to grab my rent stabilized rental apartment and flip it to a co-op yuppy - which means that eventually they‚Äôll get and cash my check in the mail chute, also charge me eviction fees, leave me with an eviction record on the local realtor‚Äôs ‚Äòblack book‚Äô and so on. This is in NYC during prime rent stabilization days - they want me out on any technicality to raise the rent $2000. Luckily, my rent check envelope ended up sunny side up in the glass chute, with postage and my return address in my handwriting on their pre-printed envelope. It took a ladder, but I get close enough to take a really good set of ‚ÄòAlice‚Äôs Restaurant‚Äô glossy 8x10 from near to far. It shows it buried low down in a blizzard of several hundred letters and bill payments running up two stories.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Did Alex Jones send child porn to Sandy Hook victims?,"No. At least, not directly. Alex Jones is being sued by Sandy Hook survivors. During the discovery phase of that lawsuit, the court ordered Jones to turn over all emails related to Sandy Hook to the survivors‚Äô lawyer. This is pretty standard procedure. Rather than just send emails pertaining to Sandy Hook, Jones buries the lawyer in a blizzard of files by sending him everything from his email server. This is a standard tactic of shady lawyers: bury the opposing team in so much stuff they have trouble sorting through it for incriminating information. Except that some of what Jones sent the Sandy Hook lawyers turned out to be child porn. Oops. This was not sent to the survivors. It was sent to their lawyer. Their lawyer immediately notified the FBI. At first, Jones said the lawyer planted the child porn to set him up, and threatened to kill the lawyer. When the FBI got involved, they found a ton of child porn on Alex Jones‚Äô server. Then Jones changed his story. Instead of saying the Sandy Hook lawyer planted it to frame him, he is now saying that it must have been placed there by malware on his server. Since he is now saying his server was infected with malware, I think someone should notify his credit card processing company, because that‚Äôs a PCI DSS violation and he could lose his ability to accept credit cards. It will be interesting to see how this unfolds. Jones has gone on one of his rants in which he swore over and over that he would never, ever have sex with a child‚Ä¶which I can‚Äôt help but think is not the same thing as swearing he would never look at child porn or that he is not attracted to children.",https://www.quora.com/Did-Alex-Jones-send-child-porn-to-Sandy-Hook-victims,"It feels extremely strange to me to even slightly defend Alex Jones, but it‚Äôs worth noting that there are millions of servers out there with poor security which have been botted or otherwise taken over, and may well be used as cutouts for child porn and other illegal nastiness. If the bad material on Alex Jones‚Äô server appears in regular mail traffic of his, he deserves everything legally coming to him. If it appears consistent with his machine being used by outsiders like millions of others are, he deserves the benefit of the doubt. Even if he consistently fails to give that to others, and worse.",Why would someone go on a rant to say they  wouldn‚Äôt  do something?

Alex Jones Sent Families Of Sandy Hook Victims Emails Containing Child Porn Alex Jones ‚Äòsent Sandy Hook victims‚Äô lawyers files containing child pornography If you asked me prior to this revelation the probability that 57,000 uncurated, largely unread emails in Alex Jones‚Äô inbox would contain 12 child porn images from VPN-using trolls, I would say that there's only a 20 percent chance for the number to be that low. Alex Jones is a 4chan meme. There are consequences to being a 4chan meme. Also, if he has that much email, how the fuck is he supposed to know which emails pertain to Sandy Hook? Sending anything less than all the email is highly likely to end up violating the subpoena by ending up missing something that mentions Sandy Hook.",Most consumers of child pornography aren't attracted to children and instead are just cruel people. Usually sadistic or/and anti social personality traits or disorder. Same is true for rapists and other sexual predators of children. Children are just easier to target. Given his taste for cruelty such as Sandy Hook conspiracy bullshit I would assume he probably falls under the cruelty aspects of it.

Blizzard Lawsuit,"According to Prince Harry, before his marriage there were ""nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers"" about Meghan Markle. Do you believe him, in light of Meghan Markle's more recent statements in her lawsuit against a tabloid?","Instead of ‚Äú battling every night to keep defamatory stories out of the papers ‚Äù Harry should have studied their content more carefully. More importantly he should have directed some digging to see who was behind them, where were those ‚Äústories‚Äù emanating from ? If such stories were appearing nightly, (a regularity which seems rather unlikely, but it‚Äôs what Harry says so leave that aside,) Harry should have wondered why there were so many, was it one source and were they corroborated. He should certainly have queried why the normally publicity hungry Markle was ruthlessly insistent on blocking publication. Uncharacteristically she blocked them being investigated. Why ? Because coincidentally this avalanche enabled her to claim victim status which in turn enabled her to pressurise Harry into leaving the wicked U.K. As that was what she‚Äôd always intended, (and planned for,) any residual hesitancy on Harrys‚Äô part, the slightest whiff that they should stay and perform their role as working Royals, would have alarmed her; so a trigger was required to make him want to leave the U.K., and speedily. Which made the ‚Äúnightly legal battles‚Äù a most fortuitous occurrence; for her ‚Ä¶. a recurring theme in her life. As a Prince with a constitutional role Harry should have paused to consider events as a whole. He had direct access to The Palace machine, its‚Äô formidable lawyers, the Byzantine Intelligence and Diplomatic network with such legendary reach and influence. The Palace maintains a relationship with all the national editors so would have known about any looming horror stories, both the content and the source. Remember that published articles are only defamatory if untrue, and as media lawyers are the smartest out there, how could this nightly deluge be possible? Had Fleet Street‚Äôs editors all gone mad simultaneously? The Palace would have quickly discovered where the real truth lay, was there an endless stream, and if so who was behind it. They would have definitely ensured Harry stayed accurately informed, no matter how uncomfortable their findings might be. This is particularly so if they found any manipulative activities behind this inexplicable torrent. They would have established if this welter of material really existed, or was an illusion of its‚Äô existence being fabricated. Conversely if stories were appearing in such volumes were they coming from separate sources or could they be traced back to a single source. Either way a situation existed whereby Harry had become alarmed enough to want to leave the UK, so who was the beneficiary of this situation. The only credible answer is Meghan Markle. Did Harry not discuss this with her, were there no rational conversations? After all, (real) adults know it‚Äôs ok to have a past, in fact it‚Äôs expected although such a blizzard of nightly disclosures might be testing. Equally, having been briefed by The Palace staff did Harry challenge Markle about the remarkably convenient timing. Whereupon did she scream and shout at him for doubting her, response-deflecting because she‚Äôd been caught out? Did she play the Lady Diana Card on Harry; was Markle herself the originator of the victims chant; ‚ÄúLook what the tabloids did to your mother, they‚Äôre doing the same to me. You must protect me ‚Ä¶‚Äù Coincidentally that comparison helpfully bestowed Lady Diana status upon her, and of course she (and Markus) had read up and learned that his mother‚Äôs fractious relationship with the media was Harry‚Äôs Achilles heel. Further coincidences one can‚Äôt help but notice are: Firstly, Harry adopted this  Lady Diana = Meghan  narrative soon afterwards, secondly, according to them it became the overriding reason why they fled the U.K., and thirdly ‚Äú It‚Äôs the tabloids ‚Äù is the one and only response to criticism that is echoed incessantly by Team Meghan and her bleating supporters. Did Harry never, not once, even quietly to himself, wonder whether the stories could be true? Or conversely that his wife had invented this back catalogue in order to initiate a sympathy-inspired response from him? Why did Harry bone headedly dismiss The Palace findings and briefings, delivered personally by his own brother in the ‚Äúthis girl‚Äù conversation, warning him to slow down. Did he never pause and consider the significance and role of his constitutional position, and therefore vicariously, that of his future wife? Manifestly not. Sadly he has since had a lot of time to reflect upon the cost of not doing so.

I‚Äôd say, M Markle frequently used, ‚Äúthe press is doing the same thing to me they did to your mother‚Äù, to manipulate Hardy every step of the way. In addition, this was the Royal Rota printing these stories. I believe they were true. It is one reason she became paranoid about having staff at Frogmore Cottage, dropped the palace advisors and etc. She demanded some odd things for her wedding, acted superior to palace staff and had other arrogant behavioral patterns that did not go over well with palace staff. It hit the news because the Royal Rota has had their sources in the palace for decades that do talk with them. She did it to herself.","Beautifully written, Michael! I think it‚Äôs optimistic to expect him to have done any self-reflection, to be honest. Has he really had the opportunity for it when conclusions can be conveniently fed to him by somebody else who can think for the both of them? By somebody whom he evidently thinks is smarter than him?",Excellent answer as always Michael I really enjoy reading your articles. I would not put anything past Meghan she is an unconscionable manipulator and she does care how her actions or words effect anyone or their lives. I still think she leaked the information to the press about Prince William‚Äôs alleged affair. Meghan only loves Meghan. This is a very sad tale and has the makings of a Shakespearian play.,"Excellent answer, Michael. And rather frightening. It makes sense that Harry would leave the UK knowing that his wife was being as horribly persecuted as his mother was. I don't remember all the things said about Lady Diana. I do recall she herself was no saint. Harry chose to hold his mother and wife in high esteem. But both are/were quite human.","I just cannot, in any way, shape, or form, understand what has blinded Harry so overwhelmingly but that the testosterone has overwhelmed and crowded his frontal lobe, meanwhile all blood normally supplying the brain has gone south. There is no other possible explanation for his mental vacancy in the matter of Meg."

It was also surprisingly good at steve vai style lead sounds as well(for the love of god). Vintage pickups would give it a more rock vibe. The main thing for me when identifying what a guitar is best at is pickups, single coils are great for clean humbuckers are great for distorted because they cancel out a lot of noise and are quieter when the gain is turned up.

Ibanez Series S,How come Ibanez got sued for making a Les Paul copy but Epiphone and other companies didn't?,"Epiphone was acquired by Gibson so they din‚Äôt sue them. As for Ibanez, well it wasn‚Äôt just Ibanez that got sued, Burny, Greco, Tokai, Aria, Electra, they all got sued by Gibson. Now how they responded was very different from each other. Ibanez and Aria changed their headstock design after the lawsuit to continue selling their guitars in USA, down the line they even made changes to their body designs and thus Ibanez Artist series guitars, and Aria Pro II series guitars were born. However Burny, Greco, Tokai refused to change their designs, because of this decision of theirs they had to restrict themselves to only Asian markets (Japanese and Chinese markets to be more accurate), of course there are sellers out there who import and sell them in USA but the custom duties levied on them make them quite overpriced. As of Electra they discontinued their Les Paul clones and their parent company St. Louis Music merged them with Westone to create the Electra-Westone guitar company in 1984, however from 1985 they started branding their guitars under Westone brand name and hence they essentially killed off the Electra brand name. Nevertheless the demands of Weston guitars fell in 1990‚Äôs too and St. Lois Music discontinued the Weston brand. However, the Electra brand was revived again in 2013 by luthiers Ben Chafin and Mick Donner and the brand now produces its own guitar designs like the Omega and Talon and also makes effect pedals.",https://www.quora.com/How-come-Ibanez-got-sued-for-making-a-Les-Paul-copy-but-Epiphone-and-other-companies-didnt,,,,,

Ibanez Series S,Should I buy a Cort M100 or Ibanez Gio GRX70 for playing heavy metal?,"I‚Äôd say you should go for the Ibanez. I have not really heard the sound of the Cort but I have seen reviews that it is a solid guitar for beginners. However (even though you can play metal with any guitar if you choose to and if you have the proper materials, such as pedals and amplifiers), Cort is directed on the more casual side, if I am not mistaken. But, if your taste is metal, go for the Gio. Ibanez is known for making great guitars for the metal genre. Of course, they don‚Äôt make the  best  metal guitars, but a Gio should do its job for what you are paying. Granted, its low price does not mean it is cheap. It just means it will not play as good as other guitars can. Do not let that bring you down. If you are a beginner and have a relatively low bugget, or don‚Äôt want to waste too much, get the Gio. If not, I suggest to go for the S, X, or Destroyer series. Also, when it comes to playing metal, make sure you get the proper amps and the proper pedals. Otherwise, you can have a really nice guitar that will sound like a knock off, $70 unbranded guitar, haha. In the end, it is up to you. Give them both a try, and see which guitar you love the best. In my opinion though, go for the Ibanez. Good luck and happy playing!  Edit:  After doing more research, I discovered that Cort can also be used for playing heavy metal, so my mistake for that. However, they are known to not have the best quality, especially the ones with the lower price. But if you get them from South Korea, they should be relatively good.",https://www.quora.com/Should-I-buy-a-Cort-M100-or-Ibanez-Gio-GRX70-for-playing-heavy-metal,,,,,
Ibanez Series S,Which is your favorite guitar and why?,"This is a question you‚Äôll get a LOT of varying answers for simply everyone‚Äôs taste being differently. My personal favorite guitars to play on were my current Epiphone SG-PRO, my current Aria STG-Pro (which was my first Electric Guitar) and my Takamine Dreadnought acoustic Guitar. I did enjoy playing on a 2014 Gibson SG, on an American made Jazz Master, a Gibson ES 335 and an Ibanez S series (which I don't remember the date of manufacturing of either of the three) and would probably end up buying one for my next electric guitar. Why is a question I‚Äôll have to answer for each model separately The Epiphone SG-PRO which I own is a Guitar which I love for the tone and the comfort of the next, it has a deep warm tone for it‚Äôs bass pickup and a thin twangy tone for its bridge pickup. The Aria STG-Pro is somehow a fake strat which sounds more like a real 70‚Äôs strat more than any other, I bought it used from an old Guitar shop in Nasr City, Cairo (which is ironically called Piano Piano) and it was the best used item I ever bought. Was also a bargain since I bought it for the equivalent of 100$ at the time. And spent an extra 50$ on repairs. The Gibson SG I played on was to me the same as mine Epiphone SG-PRO with the difference of it not depreciating in value unlike the Epiphone SG-PRO and the coil split feature (which is cool but not amazing) The Jazz Master has this tone which is perfect for some of the stuff that I‚Äôbe been wanting to play and sounds perfect to sample which is also pretty cool.

Blizzard Lawsuit,What is it like to work for Blizzard Entertainment?,"I'm a bit surprised by the negative answers I've seen here, but I suppose everyone's experience varies, so I'll tell mine. It is somewhat true that the more junior employees are not entirely paid competitively. That said, people who stay (or come in at a more senior level) are definitely compensated very well. Blizzard loves to promote from within, so a lot of people who have gone on to become more famous/influential started in Customer Service or Quality Assurance there. Yes, people typically work longer hours than a typical 40-hour work week. Most of the previous answers act as if this is something the employees are surprised by and/or don't want, which isn't true. Most of the employees at Blizzard -- actually I would go as far as to say nearly all -- prepared for years to work there. I decided to go back to school, with the dream of one day working for Blizzard. So my dream DID come true... and no, working a few more hours didn't suddenly change my mind about it. The long hours aren't just to work you more, but because two of the company values are ""Gameplay First"" and ""Commit to Quality."" A lot of fans complain about the time it takes to release Blizzard games. I can assure you the employees at Blizzard feel that pain as well. But fans only are thinking about their desire to play it; the employees don't want to release games early if they aren't up to Blizzard quality. Also, as another person mentioned, most are paid hourly (unless you are in management) due to the aftermath of the ""EA Spouse"" lawsuits. So if you are putting in a lot of overtime, you will be compensated for it. The game industry is not where most people go if their goal is to make money. As a programmer, working in tech or finance is well-known to be the best place to do that. If you go into the games industry, you do it because of your passion to make games. If you don't have the passion, then the game industry as a whole is probably not a great fit for you. If  working for Blizzard is something you are truly passionate about, then  go for it. It was an amazing experience I will always cherish, as well  as the wonderful people I met and still keep in touch with. Oh and for those interested in the more fanboy type rewards at Blizzard, here are some:
- As interns we got to speak to the ""big"" Blizzard employees in small groups: Tom Chilton, Mike Morhaime, Samwise, Chris Metzen, Dustin Browder.

Blizzard Lawsuit,How are cracked versions of software created and why are developers not able to prevent it?,"Cracked versions of software are created with the use of  debuggers . (A  debugger  is a special type of software that lets programmers deconstruct their software into its constituent parts for the purpose of  finding bugs , and thus de- bug ging. Additionally debuggers can be used for  reverse-engineering , or to see what is inside the software, to learn its logic. The latter method is used mostly by malware researchers to study what malware (or computer viruses) do on-the-inside. But it can be also used by an attacker to ""crack"" (or bypass) legal software registration, or at times, to alter normal behavior of software, for instance by injecting a malicious code into it.) For the sake of this example, I will assume that the software that is being ""cracked"" was compiled into a  native code,  and is not a .NET or a JavaScript based application. (Otherwise it will be somewhat trivial to view its source code.) The compiled  native code  is a bit more tricky ""beast"" to study. ( Native  means that the code executes directly by the CPU, GPU, or other hardware.) So let's assume that the goal of an attacker is to bypass the registration logic in the software so that he or she doesn't have to pay for it.  (Later for lolz, he or she may also post such ""crack"" on some shady online forum or on a torrent site so that others can ""use"" it too and give him or her their appreciation.) For simplicity let's assume that the original logic that was checking for the software registration was written in C++ and was something similar to the following code snippet:  In this code sample "" RegistrationName "" and "" RegistrationCode "" are special strings of text that a legitimate software user will receive after paying for the license. (The name is usually that person's actual name or their email address, and the code is some string of unique/special characters that is tied to the name.) In the logic above, the function named "" isRegistrationCodeGood() "" will check if "" RegistrationName "" and "" RegistrationCode "" are accepted using some proprietary method. If they are, it will return  true . Otherwise  false . That outcode will dictate which branch (or scope) the execution will follow. So the logic above will either show that registration failed and quit:  Or, if the registration code and name matched, it will save the registration details in persistent storage (such as the  File System  or  System Registry ) using the function named "" rememberRegistrationParameters() "" and then display the message thanking the user for registering:  A ""cracker"" will obviously want to achieve the second result for any registration code that he or she enters. But they have a problem. They do not have the C++ source code, part of which I showed above. (I hope not!) So the only recourse for an attacker is to  disassemble  the binary code (that always ships with software in the form of  .exe  and  .dll  files on Windows, and mostly as  Unix executables  inside the  .app  packages on a Mac.) An attacker will then use a debugger to study the binary code and try to locate the registration logic that I singled out above. Next you can see the flowchart for a snippet of code that I showed in C++, presented via a low-level debugger. Or, as the code will be read in the binary form after  compilation : (For readability I added comments on the right with the names of functions and variables. They will not be present in the code that an attacker could see.)  (To understand what is shown above an attacker will have to have good knowledge of the Assembly language instructions for the native code.) I also need to point out that having a disassembly snippet like the one above is the final result for an attacker. The main difficulty for him or her is to locate it among  millions and millions  of other similar lines of code. And that is their main challenge. Not many people can do it and that is why software ""cracking"" is a special skill.  So having found the code snippet above in the software binary file a ""cracker"" has two choices: 1)  Modify (or patch)  the binary. 2)  Reverse-engineer  the "" isRegistrationCodeGood() "" function and copy its logic to create what is known as a "" KeyGen "" or ""Key Generator."" Let's review both: The first choice  is quite straightforward. Since an attacker got this far, he or she knows the  Intel x64 Instruction Set  quite well. So they simply change the conditional jump from "" jnz short loc_7FF645671430 "" at the address  00007FF645671418  (circled in red in the screenshots) to unconditional jump, or "" jmp short loc_7FF645671430 "". This will effectively remove any failed registration code entries and anything that the user types in will be accepted as a valid registration. Also note that this modification can be achieved by changing just one byte in the binary code from  0x75  to  0xEB :  But this approach comes with a ""price"" of modifying the original binary file. For that an attacker needs to write his own ""patcher"" (or a small executable that will apply the modification that I described above.) The downside of this approach for an attacker is that patching an original executable file will break its  digital signature , which may alert the end-user or the vendor. Additionally the ""patcher"" executable made by an attacker can be easily flagged and blocked by the end-user's antivirus software, or lead criminal investigators to the identity of the attacker. The second choice  is a little bit more tricky. An attacker will have to study "" isRegistrationCodeGood() "" function and copy it into his own small program that will effectively duplicate the logic implemented in the original software and let him generate the registration code from any name, thus giving any unscrupulous user of that software an ability to register it without making a payment. Vendors of many major software products understand the potential impact of the second method and try to prevent it by requiring what is known as ""authentication."" This is basically a second step after registration, where the software submits registration name to the company's web server that returns a response back to the software of whether the code was legitimate or not. This is done by Microsoft when you purchase Windows (they call it ""Activate Windows"") and also by Adobe, and many other companies. This second step may be done behind-the-scenes on the background while the software is running, and will usually lead to cancellation of prior registration if it was obtained illegally.  So now you know how software is ""cracked"". Let me answer why it is not possible to prevent it.  It all boils down to the fact that any software code needs to be read either by CPU (in case of a binary  native code ) or by an  interpreter   or a  JIT compiler  (in case of JavaScript or .NET code.) This means that if there's a way to read/interpret something, no matter how complex or convoluted it is, an attacker with enough knowledge and persistence will be able to read it as well, and thus break it. There is an argument though that  cloud-based  software is more secure, which is true, since its (binary) code remains on the server and end-users do not have direct access to it. And even though cloud-based software is definitely the future, it has some major drawbacks that will never allow it to fully replace your conventional software. To name just a few: Not everyone has an internet connection, or is willing to upload their data online. Additionally someone‚Äôs internet connection can be very expensive or too slow to make the software run very  laggy . Then there‚Äôs a question of  distributed computing . For instance, Blizzard Entertainment would never make ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft‚Äù to fully run on their servers due to immense computational resources needed to render every single scene for every player they have. Thus it is in their best interest to let each individual user‚Äôs computer to do the rendering instead. As a software developer myself, I obviously don't like when people steal software licenses. But I have to accept it and live with it. The good news is that there are not that many people who are willing to go extra mile and search for a cracked version of software. The main problem for those who do, is that by downloading a patched executable, or an attacker's  KeyGen  or a  Patcher , they are effectively "" trusting "" him or her not to put anything ""nasty"" into it that was not ""advertised on the package"" (stuff like trojans, malware, or keyloggers.) So the question for those people becomes -- is it worth the cost of the software license to potentially infect your system with a nasty virus? On the other side of the equation, some developers react very negatively to any attempts to steal their software licenses. (I was there too.) They try to implement all kinds of countermeasures -- anything from tricking reverse-engineers, to adding  booby traps  in the code that may do something nasty if the code detects that it is being debugged, to obfuscating or scrambling the code, to enforcing all kinds of convoluted  DRM  schemes, to blocking users from certain countries. I personally try to stay away from  all  of those measures. And here's why: A)  Any kind of anti-reverse-engineering tactics could be bypassed by an attacker with enough persistence. So why bother and waste my time when I can invest that time into adding something useful to my software that will make it more productive for legitimate users? B)  Some  code packers  could create false positives with antivirus software, which is obviously not good for marketing of that software. It also creates unnecessary complexity for the developer to debug the software. C)  Adding  booby traps  in the code can also ‚Äúmisfire‚Äù on your legitimate users, which will really infuriate them and can even lead to lawsuits. D)  Any  DRM  scheme will probably catch some 100 illegal users and greatly inconvenience 10,000 legitimate ones. So why do it to your good customers? E)  Our statistics show that about 75% of all illegal licenses come from China, Russia, Brazil, to name the worst offenders.  (I also understand that the reason may be much lower incomes that people have in those countries.)  The main issue for us though was the fact that if we enforce our DRM or add some strong registration authentication, many people that wanted to bypass our registration would simply use a stolen credit card number. And we had no control over it. Our system will use it to send them a legitimate license only to have the payment bounce in weeks time. As a result we would lose the money that were paid for the license, plus the credit card company will impose an additional chargeback fee to our account, which may range from $0.25 to $20 per bad purchase on top of the license cost. F)  As was pointed out in the comments, some companies may actually benefit from allowing pirated copies of their software. Microsoft for instance gets a lot of free publicity from people using their Windows OS, the same goes for Adobe with their Photoshop. That is a good point that I agree with.  So my philosophy is now this -- if someone wants to go extra mile and  steal  our software, go for it! They went this far to do it anyway, so they probably have a good reason. On the positive side there are so many other customers that appreciate the work that goes into creating software that greatly outnumber those that don‚Äôt.  PS. Thank you everyone! It makes me feel good that the knowledge I shared is useful to others. If you want to see more of my tech articles, check out my blog at  dennisbabkin.com/blog",https://www.quora.com/How-are-cracked-versions-of-software-created-and-why-are-developers-not-able-to-prevent-it,"Just one comment, crack attempts are comming from countries like Russia, China or Brazil only because their paychecks are a lot different than in more developed ones, so they are not doing it to show off, but rather because a Photoshop license costs a whole month salary, and it‚Äôs usually not even used for commercial uses, what means, that even if you were able to prevent software from being cracked, your revenues wouldn‚Äôt be much higher, because most people would stick with a free alternative, while in this case you might get a long time customer, because he is used to your software from childhood, what means, that in my opinion companies are really not losing that much, I would even say, that some might get an extra profit because of that.","Sorry, I‚Äôm one of those bad user who occasionally can‚Äôt pay for the software, I really understand the risk of illegal patches, to circumvent that risk I have Windows 10 Pro license so I can use Hyper-V feature to make several Virtual machine, some of them are ‚ÄúKeygen Sandbox‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftware Sandbox‚Äù. If the software I need is quite resource intensive, then I need to little bit compromise my safety by placing that program on Sandboxie. Only legally purchased or acquired software run on my main OS.","Also, cracked software is free marketing. I have read a major factor for the success of Microsoft and games like GTA was the number of cracked copies that were downloaded. It helped make those brands household names. (Not that I promote illegal software, just sayin). The same is probably true for Photoshop. There are kids posting YouTube videos with Photoshop tutorials. They are promoting the software for free. In the grand scheme of things, sure cracked software is bad but it can have a positive side effect.","I've been preaching it for years that DRM only hurts legitimate customers. This is why I buy my games almost exclusively from GOG. As a developer I understand the feeling of trying to protect your work, but at the end if your product is good, people will pay for it, regardless of DRM.","Thanks for this explanation. Just a quick note about MacOS: .dmg files are merely ‚Äúdisk images,‚Äù which are essentially compressed folders that are treated by the filesystem as a volume that it mounts, rather than a plain ‚Äòole folder. If you were trying to mess around with an installed executable, you‚Äôd want to go into the .app folder* for the application, and/or various Library folders scattered around the filesystem. *Mac .app files ‚Äúfeel like‚Äù .exe files in that, when you double-click on them in the Finder, they launch the application. But they‚Äôre really folders, inside which are (usually) a mixture of compiled/executable binaries, text files (e.g. headers, frameworks, property lists, XML docs), and images (e.g. icons)."

Tricking,Human Behavior:  What are some cool body language tricks to use on people?,"Watch their feet! You can frequently tell the social dynamic of a group of people by seeing which way their feet are pointing. ¬∑  Feet pointing away from the group  - Probably means he's getting ready to leave or is feeling uncomfortable with the group. The latter case can normally be identified by fidgeting or avoiding eye contact with the group. ¬∑  Each foot pointing to a different member of the group  - This is common amongst groups of good friends in conversation, you can draw lines based on which way the feet are pointing and notice how they intersect. They usually make a regular pattern such as a triangle in the case of 3 friends. If someone's feet don't intersect with the group in a logical way then it's likely they're new to the group or are not being as readily accepted for some reason ¬∑  Both feet facing one person  - Particularly significant in a group. Usually means ""I want to speak to you on your own"" or ""I'm really interested in what you're saying or doing"". You can see if it's being reciprocated if the person is mirroring the action though in this case there will often be more obvious indicators that the people are interested in each other. There are tons of different combinations of feet facing but the above are enough to get your feet off the ground *pauses for readers to groan* Lets look at a couple of other feet factors; ¬∑ Walking with feet in line  - Two people walking at the same pace with their feet in line is normally a sign of good rapport (or of a body language hacking sociopath such as myself).
If you see a couple and one becomes distracted or worried you can see the steps fall out of sync. If you then see one of the partners re-engage by making the other laugh for example then their steps will almost immediately fall back in sync. ¬∑ Shifting of the feet  - Most people know this one. Shifting your feet is sometimes a sign of unease or discomfort. I mention this specifically to tell you not to read too much into it - some people have itchy pants.

Italian Restaurant,Why are there red and white checkered tablecloths in Italian restaurants?,"Italian restaurants serve a lot of pasta, which often involves a lot of tomato sauce and cheese. These tend to splatter, especially when you gesture a lot with your hands while you talk, which Italians do.     This tablecloth pattern causes the consequent red and white splatters to be less noticeable and therefore more aesthetically pleasing to the diners.
I would venture to guess this is a greater problem in the US than elsewhere, due to the fact that most Americans like to eat their spaghetti with a fork and spoon, which causes more splattering than the traditional Italian custom of using only a fork (not for the reason you might think - it's because the fork-only technique requires more attentiveness and less pasta per bite; the spoon technique allows for carelessness ergo more splattering).  See  THE SPOON QUESTION, OR HOW TO EAT PASTA LIKE AN EXPERT . Hope that's helpful.

Italian Restaurant,How can you tell a good Italian restaurant before trying their food?,"Well, sometimes you can, and sometimes you can‚Äôt. I had a friend in Chicago. She‚Äôs married now, and I‚Äôve lost track of her. I flew into O‚ÄôHara on business. She picked me up at the airport, and vowed we were going to have an Italian dinner to remember. The restaurant, not far from the airport, was in an area that was ‚Äúsketchy‚Äù at best. However, the parking lot, packed with Cadillacs, was surrounded by a high wire fence. We didn‚Äôt have to worry about her car because there was a guy, named Gino, straight out of Soprano‚Äôs casting watching over all the fancy cars. He assured us Pam‚Äôs Accord would also be safe. It was a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù restaurant. It must have been Father/Daughter Night, because almost every table had a doting ‚Äúfather‚Äù seated with his lovely twenty something companion.

We were walking through some kind of ethnic area‚Äîperhaps Lebanese‚Äîbustling, all perfectly safe. My friend said that all this running about had made her hungry. She suggested we stop for an early dinner. Well, what I had in mind was a late romantic dinner, perhaps at No. Fifty Cheyne. However‚Ä¶. We walked a few minutes more.

So this may be more authentic than marinara or pomodoro‚Ä¶ Carrot Bechamel Finely shred three or four carrots along with a stalk of celery and a shallot or two. Mash it all into a sauce pan barely covering them with milk. Bring it to a low boil then turn it off. Add your favorite herbs, such as fresh thyme, tarragon, or fennel seed. Every few minutes, heat it up barely to a boil again, stirring for a minute or so. Repeat this for an hour or two so that it remains fairly hot to extract the flavor from the vegetables. You may have to add more milk. Strain it through a fairly fine sieve, squeezing as much liquid as possible out of the mash, keeping only the liquid. Melt a couple of tablespoons of butter in another pan and gradually stir in an equal amount of flour. Once it‚Äôs thoroughly blended, add a bit of the carrot-flavored milk from above, stirring while heating until it bubbles a bit and thickens. Keep adding more of the carrot-flavored milk, a bit at a time, then stirring while heating until it bubbles and thickens once again. Repeat until you‚Äôve blended it all in.

Italian Restaurant,What do Italians generally eat in an Italian restaurant?,"Impossible to answer, the dishes that a restaurant serves depend on the area in which it‚Äôs located. In the area where I live (Emilia Romagna) the ""Trattorie""(plural of ‚Äútrattoria‚Äù) are very frequent. Trattoria is a restaurant, generally not elegant, where traditional dishes are served.
Usually you go to eat in a Trattoria on Friday for dinner, Saturday for dinner or for Sunday lunch. When I go to a Trattoria with my friends, the meal is composed as follows: Bis di primi (two types of pasta / filled pasta).

Pepe the frog,Why is Pepe the frog falsely referred to as a racist symbol?,"Because it is. Feels bad, man. Denizens of the darker corners of the Internet turned an innocent frog comic into a hate symbol of the ""deplorable"" alt-right. ""Pepe the Frog"" first appeared in 2005 in the comic ""Boy's Life"" by artist and illustrator Matt Furie. The comics depict Pepe and his anthropomorphized animal friends behaving like stereotypical post-college bros: playing video games, eating pizza, smoking pot and being harmlessly gross. In 2008, fans of the comic began uploading Furie's work online. In one comic, Pepe responds to a question about his bathroom habits with, ""Feels good, man."" That reaction image and catchphrase took on a life of its own on the Internet, meriting a Know Your Meme entry by 2009. Alternate iterations of Pepe, including sad, smug and angry Pepes, followed. Pepe memes are ubiquitous across 4chan, Reddit, Imgur, Tumblr, and other social media and image-sharing sites. It all seemed in good fun, but in late September, Pepe's green visage was designated a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League. The ADL's online hate symbol database is designed to help law enforcement, educators, and members of the general public identify potentially hateful images, explained Oren Segal, the director of the organization's Center on Extremism. He said that in recent years, hate symbols have proliferated online. Now, with things like Pepe the frog, anti-Semitic images are originating and circulating almost primarily on social media. In some instances, Pepe wears a Hitler mustache, and his signature message is replaced with ""Kill Jews Man."" In others, Pepe poses in front of a burning World Trade Center, dressed like an Orthodox Jewish person with a yarmulke and payot. He's also been spotted wearing a Nazi soldier's uniform and in a KKK hood and robe. In May, the Daily Beast spoke to a white supremacist who said there had been a concerted effort on the site 4chan to ""reclaim Pepe"" from normal people in late 2015. Pepe had gone mainstream: He's been tweeted by Katy Perry, who said she has a ""Pepe file"" on her computer, and has made multiple appearances on Nicki Minaj's Instagram. So the supremacist group remixed him with Nazi propaganda for a laugh. It originated on /rk9/, the 4chan message board associated with some of the least savory elements of the Internet. Last fall, people on that board purposefully framed two innocent individuals for the Umpqua Community College shooting. It's allegedly where Isla Vista shooter Elliot Rodger announced his shooting before it took place ‚Äî in a post with a Pepe meme. Nazi Pepe made its way to Twitter, where people who regularly tweeted messages supporting white nationalism and anti-immigrant views quickly absorbed it into their Internet repertoire. People who identify with those movements add the frog emoji to their Twitter name.

Presidential Election,How will the results of the 2016 Presidential Election affect China?,"To start off, China may seek stronger ties outside the US benefit from increased Chinese returnees prepare for higher risk of conflicts with the U.S. I. Stronger ties elsewhere During campaigns, Trump has declared that he would raise tariffs and pursue cases against China in the World Trade Organization. He has specifically said that he will label China a ""currency manipulator"". ‚ÄúMr Trump has called for‚Ä¶ a 45% tariff on Chinese goods.‚Äù  Trump v Clinton: Comparing their economic plans - BBC News Whether or not he would follow through and whether the rhetoric would be implemented, we‚Äôd see. But if China perceive enough risks in a trade-wars, how may they respond? China would seek  technology, weapons, resources and market elsewhere  in case American protectionism is on the rise.  One of the ways to do so is to  accelerate the development of the ‚Äúone road, one belt‚Äù initiatives . This is a gi-normous program. We‚Äôre talking not just selling cheap shoes and toothbrush elsewhere because Walmart isn‚Äôt buying any more. We‚Äôre talking about everything from hi-tech weaponry to strategic resources. We‚Äôre talking trillions of infrastructure builds fromhigh-speed rail to power plants. Chinawants to industrialize countries spanning Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Russia, Iran, etc. These states are not exactly friendly to the United States before. We‚Äôre also talking about traditional US allies in Europe, like Germany, joining that economic and strategic block. That's alot of countries that may move closer to China, especially if a  Trump Presidency is considered irrational or unreliable . By the way, there's no God ordained reason why any of these trades need to be conducted in the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar reserve currency status could be challenged. II. More returnees to support Chinese rise in tech leadership: Trump ran on anti-immigration platform. Asian Americans make up of 30% of the work force in Silicon Valley, but they represent less than 0.3% of the SV companies‚Äô board directorship (I read that somewhere before. Credible sources are most welcome). What could account the  100 times difference ? Is it  racism ? Is racism bad and is it going to be worse? Before, Chinese immigrants tolerated low level racism in the workplace. Because whatever the subtle shun, snide remarks, etc. it was still a better life than back home. You know, being passed over for promotion to be mid-level engineering manager at IBM in Raleigh was still better than working at a sweat shop in Shenzhen. But what if white supremacists increasingly target Asians?  And what if Shenzhen is now looking like this?  And what if instead of making cheap shits, you can start-up a company building robots?  If Trump represents America‚Äôs turn towards a more  overtly   racist country , high-skilled workers immigrants may get turned off and seek greener pastures back home in China. The impacts are worse than Big tech/Startups failing to hire Chinese new engineering grads, it also means high-powered researchers departure. Let‚Äôs just look at one hot area:  Artificial   Intelligence . Mr. Wang (ÁéãÂíèÂàö) at Zhihu tallied up the paper citations statistics of ‚ÄúChinese sounding‚Äù researchers in the top journals. The citations of the top researchers are grouped into ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù and ‚ÄúNon-Chinese‚Äù researchers, on the left and right, respectively. Note that they‚Äôre Chinese Americans or immigrants working in US universities and research institutions and may not necessarily be Chinese nationals. The ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-Chinese‚Äù citations are very comparable.  This is on top of the indigenous AI publications from mainland China. According to a 2016 White House report on AI, China already surpassed the US in cited Deep Learning research papers.  Implications? Chinese technology industry gains much needed talent while US future dominance in a promising field is at risk. III. Higher national security risks Last time the U.S. elected an inexperienced president, they made up some excuse to invade a country they didn't like. What would Trump do to China? The scary thing is that his utter lack of foreign services and military experience make him unpredictable. Would he wage war against another nuclear power just to prove his manhood and the size of his‚Ä¶.eh‚Ä¶. hands? I don't know. And I'm betting that the PLA doesn't either.

Pepe the frog,Why is Pepe the frog in a clown suit associated with white supremacy and the alt right?,"Pepe the frog is a maligned symbol of those who see the current state of affairs worthy of a frog meme. To say he is alt right, or Nazi is like saying that Santa clause likes the Spanish inquisition. Here is the art of conflation - if you are for white people then you surely are in favor of slavery since 300 years ago a few whites and a whole lot of other enthnicities enslaved people. You would also be a cannibal since one white person, Jeffery Dahmer ate people (he was kind enough to kill them first). Pepe was given birth to by a female computer game programmer. It wasn‚Äôt her idea however. The activities of this particular female programmer,  Anita Sarkeesian , became the fulcrum of what has become as known as gamer-gate. I will not elaborate much, but each side clearly think they are in the right. The problem here is that a certain number of irreverent teenagers and twenty somethings were offended when a female programmer-come journalist went feminist on their sorry asses. Apparently they liked their male oriented video games with the females only in supporting roles. Her game sucked as well I understand. I looked into that, bought a copy and played it. It‚Äôs worth looking into. In the game you suffer severe penalties if you make hetero choices in her game. The game is weak, but interesting - I never played more than 1 hour. I have to like it though - according to her if I don‚Äôt like her game than I am a Nazi. She also later criticized games she admitted she never played. Interesting. She won ahigh paying job as a left wing oriented gamers journalist in her crusade for defense of the oppresssed female gamer. We‚Äôve seen this before. veritas? - Latin for truth. If you‚Äôve never played a video game before, I understand. The problem is, that gaming has nothing to do with female oppression. It has to do with male consumers and the silly 15 year old pubescent tropes that are perceived to sell games. The more female consumers on the other hand, the more of the opposite you would see and I‚Äôm quite sure you wouldn‚Äôt see MGTOW complaining - -they‚Äôve already gone their own way. OK with me, to each his own. The roles females are portrayed in - the damsel in distress, demeans the ability of a woman to rebuild a broken M-16 while under fire or carry a kegger to her thirsty male troops. Women can hold up the sky, if you follow Mao. Making a crisis out of gaming roles is a fine example of what is silly in the left movement. You see - what is needed is more serious female gamers, we know you are out there - it‚Äôs time to step forward. And don‚Äôt write stupid games and complain oppression if your game flops. Learn to code well, with inspiration. Needless to say, a lot of sweaty gamers began to look at dishonest media activity a certain way. From there it spread. Now these sweaty boys, and a few girls as well, coined a term. ‚Äúnormie‚Äù. In short, someone who follows the norms, doesn‚Äôt know what is going on and believes the press. They would like to tell you normies where to shove your political norms - but they are patient, and some of them are amateur hackers with an agenda. If you‚Äôve been following the press, a few Nazis apparently liked the attitude of these anti establishment teenagers and they took up the Pepe cause. This does not mean Pepe wears a swastika - far from it. Actually the Nazi cause is one of the oppressed, they are complaining that they are being picked on because of their identity - just like the black lives matter movement etc. Just like the feminists who started gamergate. Worse, in every crowd there are fanatics, and those mentally ill - it became ugly with alleged death threats to sarkesian. Unfortunately not all artists are created alike, and some have drawn profane symbols on pepe‚Äôs arm. The teenagers might have liked guys with swastikas giving feminists the middle finger, any teenager likes opposing their feminist parents. Few have actually considered that all of this shenanigans is all just an identitarian race to the bottom to see who is the biggest victim. This is silly to anyone with a brain. Silly like a horror story. Stop with the conflation. It‚Äôs time for the press to realize their act is easy to see through. Stop with the identitariansism. E pluribus unum, or so I was taught. Does it still apply, or am I to be forced into a corner with people of the same skin color, some of which have very bad manners? I think not - and attempts to do so will be resisted severely. Clown world indeed. Stop conflating opposition to the left‚Äôs murderous Marxist agenda with the Nazi symbol - you are just giving attention to a very small movement of Nazis who are also true identitarians like you on the left- is that what you want? The actions in gamer gate reveal to us the stored potential energy of these issues. Using entertainment to project desired tropes and suppress undesired tropes hits gamers right where they live - and very few of them self identified as Nazis. What have you the left done? Is this what you want? Do you want to create Nazis!? Project veritas has some revelations regarding the google algorithm and what they call ‚Äúfairness.‚Äù Clown world indeed.

Blizzard Lawsuit,"Lawyers who represented lawsuits against big companies, how did it go?","There is a kind of initiation process in which the lawyer has to prove to the other side that a paper blizzard is not going to be successful.

I once got into such an exchange, and the judge finally called us all to the bench, informed us that we had filed every conceivable motion, and that he was just going to sit on everything for a month and was ordering us, on pain of judicial displeasure, to resolve some, if not all, of the dispute.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Why was League of Legends even created? Was Dota (Dota 2) not enough?,"Actually, LoL was released in 2009, 4 years before before Dota 2 was released in 2013. If you were refering Dota as the mod of warcraft 3, the answer was because DOTA had less than enough developer to give steady updates, so i guess the riot games took that oportunity to make their own DOTA. It's the same way with valve after seeing LoL success, valve wanted it's own DOTA by offering Ice Frog(One of DOTA dev) to work with them. It got tangled a bit in lawsuit with Blizzard because of the name Dota 2 valve planned on using was similar to DOTA the name of the Blizzard fan community-made mod. Heck, Blizzard even made it's own ‚ÄúBlizzard DOTA"" in attempt to win the lawsuit. Valve won the lawsuit to keep the name Dota 2 and the name DOTA was given to Blizzard fan community. Blizzard still had it's own official DOTA though, going by the name of ‚ÄúHeroes of The Storm"". So...

Blizzard Lawsuit,Is it illegal to mod or give yourself something in a video game?,"Generally speaking, it is not against the law to mod a game or to cheat in a game. It may be against the rules or policies of a company, and you may get banned (temporarily or permanently), but it‚Äôs not typically  unlawful . It becomes unlawful if the company can successfully prove that you violated a copyright they own, or if you access the company‚Äôs servers without permission. These are both most likely to happen in client-server games, where your computer has to communicate with the company‚Äôs servers as part of the game. As one example, Blizzard successfully sued the makers of a bot program and won a rather large amount of money in the process:  Blizzard wins $8.5m lawsuit against bot makers You might also run into issues if an EULA contains an agreement not to mod or cheat the game; the penalties for that are still typically going to be solely withing the game (banning you or your account, removing items you obtained by doing so, etc), but it‚Äôs something else to be careful of.",https://www.quora.com/Is-it-illegal-to-mod-or-give-yourself-something-in-a-video-game,,,,,

Removal of the original Warcraft III, so the game was a  forced   up(down)grade . Removal of some of the features available in the original Warcraft III. Change in the TOS so Blizzard could claim custom games as their own intellectual property.  Yep, they are still salty about the DOTA lawsuit. A few things just down to bad personal taste: The new graphics is actually very unpolished. My first impression of the game is it felt like  HoN  (a 2010 game!) in style and level of graphical detail. Some of the characters look plain weird. Like Mannoroth's head looks like an Abomination's head. Weird voice acting, most notably that they replaced ‚ÄúGrom"" with ‚ÄúHellscream,‚Äù in every scene because Honda copyrighted the name.

Blizzard Lawsuit,What is the real reason for all of the frivolous lawsuits the Trump campaign is filling?,"Thanks for the question.  David Bossie - A-Lister in a D-List World. The Trump has for about six months known the election could not be won through the voting booth. At that time they began a process of planning for a win not by counted votes or through the traditional electoral collage, but through a process of either eliminating states from the college or flip[ping states. The main idea of flipping a state came from Florida where there was a tight race in 2000, and feelings this could happen again. DeSantis is very much not an advocate of Democracy, and it was felt that if the vote in Florida went for Biden, DeSantis would flip the State by executive orders and either have his state eliminated from consideration, changing the votes needed to win in the college, or landing it in the supreme court who would have the election to Trump based on what would be claimed was prima facie the will of the people. Withe the Blue landslide - big enough to make it a convincing win, it turned out the Republicans needed three states - Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. Florida, with its fascist leader, was not needed, and thus the ballgame was lost. However, that did not mean Giuliani did not intend to try and get it to the supreme court where the final election of the Democratic system could be adjudicated a Trump win. Now, I write a lot about D-listers in the Trump campaign, but hidden deep in the Trump world their are some dedicated believers in fascism who have been at work pulling apart the American voting system for years. I will now introduce you to David Bossie. Most people who read this will not know Bossie unless they remember his ‚Äúcotton picking mind‚Äù racist comments on Fox News and the slap on the hand, but he is part of the Steve Bannon / Corey Lewandowski gang whose racism and desire to derail democracy are connected to a lack of bottom line morals. There is no bottom to their ethics, and that has made them oddly dangerous. Using a group called Citizens United and getting the Supreme Court to legislate from the bench, he derailed protections against racism in voting that had in essence enfranchised a million voters and engineered Trump‚Äôs win - along with some special Russian help. Now, Bossie is playing a game of chess, but his playing board keeps getting messed up by a guy who wont keep his hands out of this pants, Giuliani. Bossie wants one thing, and one thing only - the supreme court to call the election, and to end further elections in the United States by having a combination of governors and the supreme court in the drivers seat from now on. So the Trump campaign filed a series of lawsuits in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. He needs to overturn those elections, walk them to the supreme court, and have them either called by the governors or by the court itself depending on who the governor is. He has a hard row to follow. The DOJ found, and then fired the people who found, the election was the most secure in history. CISA backed this up. The FBI found fraud - mostly happening from Republican sources. So what he wants to have happen is make sure the lawsuits run out the clock and the states fail to certify the votes. Then will come the zinger. After having failed to certify the votes because of Republican lawsuits, the Republicans will file with the Supreme Court to overturn the votes based on‚Ä¶ failure to certify - which they themselves caused. Now comes Giuliani. Bossie needs all three of these states he has filed a blizzard of lawsuits in to keep up the adjudication until after certification is due, so he needs to slow step the process as he has no evidence to get into a real trail. Giuliani though keeps filing nuisance suits and spinning huge conspiracy theories which - as a plaintiff in these cases, Judges can and are taking notice of. Each time Giuliani reaches into his pants and pulls out a new lie it actually blows another case out of the water, a case that needs to stay in play. Somehow they are keeping the idiot in chief quiet, or marginally so, but Giuliani is like a dog in heat humping the leg of every judge he can reach, and judges are not happy at all about it. Now many in the Trump orbit want him and the dirty tricks crew to move on to Georgia for the runoff for Senate. They have moved Florida staff, and they need to flood D-Listers into the state because they can do all sorts of things to cause problems, but not if they are busy fighting a battle that is finished elsewhere.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-real-reason-for-all-of-the-frivolous-lawsuits-the-Trump-campaign-is-filling,"Thanks for details.

Blizzard Lawsuit,"My employer held me back several hours late. Road conditions turned icy after dark. If I was involved in a collision as a result, would my employer have any liability?","Generally no unless, as Mary Finn says, the employer was aware of the situation and acted with total disregard for your safety. For example, a blizzard hit Rochester, NY in the early evening (a Friday) during the winter of 1986. The National Weather Service (NWS) had been tracking the storm across the Midwest for several days and they‚Äôd been on track. The storm was predicted to hit and bury Buffalo by early afternoon. It was suggested that Rochester area employers let their people go by mid-afternoon. Few did. Storms had a habit of turning at the last minute and heading up over the lake. This very thing had burned most of the employers in town back in the 70s. A blizzard had buried Buffalo, most Rochester employers sent everyone home and then ‚Ä¶ nothing. The storm turned north and most of the working people of Rochester got to enjoy a chilly but sunny Friday afternoon off. Employers still remembered that a decade later. So when the storm nailed Buffalo, few employers budged. But it didn‚Äôt turn and now public authorities were telling all non-essential businesses to shut down and send everyone home. Most complied ‚Ä¶ so many that many people never made it home. The storm came on fast instead of turning. Congestion on many roads and the New York State Thruway meant that even those who got out two hours before it hit often never made it home that evening. There were many lawsuits, but I believe the final outcome was that as long as the employer let people go when authorities told them to, they were harmless. Only those who stayed open after that were liable ‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs your callous disregard for employee safety. But not always. Several mall stores near where I lived elected to stay open until it was too late. That might seem to be a good case except that the mall management announced that any workers and shoppers still in the mall should stay put. One of the restaurants announced that they‚Äôd remain open and feed people and several others said they‚Äôd help with things like bedding. A few employees tried to leave anyone and at least one was killed. Her suit however was unsuccessful. Plaintiffs said she had to get home to her children; defendant said that she was advised that would be impossible and that she had a place to stay. In this case, the store did act with disregard by staying open too long, but it was held that she was sufficiently contributory to her own death to not hold the store.",https://www.quora.com/My-employer-held-me-back-several-hours-late-Road-conditions-turned-icy-after-dark-If-I-was-involved-in-a-collision-as-a-result-would-my-employer-have-any-liability,"A great question. A lot to be said here. Workmen‚Äôs Compensation laws usually protect the employer from suits by employee for on the job injury arising out of and in course of one‚Äôs work. Then liability is determined by negligence. Who is negligent? Then there is assumption of risk. The question is too vague for a reasonable guess. If you made a left turn in front of an oncoming car, or maybe a car turned left in front of you, or suppose a car was following you too closely and slid into you while stopping. Did you know when staying late that the road would ice up? Did your boss know? Options? Just stay in place. Get a hotel. Put chains on. Ignorance versus negligence. What someone one should have known, what a reasonable person should have known and results, etc. Great question. But too much speculation to answer.",,,,

And as someone who plays Ibanez exclusively, I‚Äôd say that the RG is a great place to start as well. Whatever you choose to do doesn‚Äôt really matter. What matters is that you just do it!! Do something. Don‚Äôt just wait till the right answer comes along. Go out, try some different guitars and see which one feels most comfortable to you and your style of playing. Then you‚Äôll get happy and start heading down the road to guitar mastery and hopefully having fun along the way. Here are a few tips to help you get started with the fun technique of finger tapping 1.) Play on the tips of your fingers; this will allow you to produce the clearest sound 2.) Create a hammer on pull off with both fingers and play the one after the other 3.) Start off on a clean channel on the amp to begin with so you can really hear what you sound like 4.) Use the palm of your picking hand to mute unwanted strings to get the cleanest sound possible 5.) Stretch out that pinky. Do some finger exercises to accomplish this 6.) Practice, practice, practice Finger tapping is a bit of an advanced technique and sounds really cool once you master it but it is a bit of a work out so I‚Äôd start slow and if you keep at it (a little bit everyday) you‚Äôll begin to see some results. Then when you add gain to it, that‚Äôs when it really starts getting fun. I hope this helped and if you feel there is anything else I can do, please let me know. Best of luck to you in your quest to find the right guitar for finger tapping and getting this technique down. It‚Äôs really fun to play once you do. I‚Äôd recommend starting out with some finger warms first and getting your fingers developed. If your development is in the right steps, you‚Äôll do fine. If you need some help in this area, feel free to leave me a comment below and I‚Äôll direct you to more in depth video lesson on how finger exercises can really help develop your playing. Sincerely, Dwayne Jenkins http://www.dwaynesguitarlsssons.com",https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-guitar-spec-for-double-handed-tapping,Thanks Dwayne lots of good tips there. I actually had an RGA32 before but found that the fret wire was very prominent and found that doing tapping with slides was more difficult that compared to my telecaster. I probably could've sanded down the fret wire but never bothered,,,,
Ibanez Series S,"Which is better on a budget, the Ibanez RG or S/SA?","Both models offer budget-freindly instruments, though the S/SA series are mahogany, while the RG's are basswood. If you like slashing metal tones in the higher end of the tone spectrum, get the RG. For a more smoother tone, go for the S/SA series. If you're not necessarily particular about the tone, and just want a versatile pickup configuration and extremely easy playability, either one will do the job. With the right amp, no one is going to tell the difference between a $400 guitar and a $4,000 one, at least not in the distortion channel. One of my favorite guitars, is the very first Ibanez I bought (RG 270) brand new for 375 bucks.

Ibanez Series S,"Back in the 1970‚Äôs it seemed that many of us who played acoustic guitars, played more Martins or Gibsons than anything else. What do you think are the most popular brands of acoustics among the current generation of guitarists?","Martin is going from strength to strength. A lot of the guys I play with have Martins. With them, Taylors and Guilds are the names I like to see. A lot of people (especially on Quora) seem to have tried Taylor 314s, and think they lack something. It‚Äôs true. The Taylor equivalent of the classic Martins is the 8 series, of which the 814 is the most popular. Martin also makes more budget models now, like the 314s, and they also lack something. Guilds seemed to vanish from the European market for a while, except as sought-after second-hand guitars. I‚Äôve never heard a bad-sounding Guild, and I‚Äôve never played one that didn‚Äôt play well. I haven‚Äôt seen a Gibson acoustic for years (as in, seen with my eyes, rather than on TV or film). Gibsons have always had a massive draw with the American market, but here in Europe Gibson acoustics didn‚Äôt seem to get the same reverence that their solid and semi-acoustic guitars get. I still see a lot of Gibson solid-bodies and semis. I agree they were very popular in the 70s. Ovations were also popular in the 70s and 80s. In fact, I‚Äôd say I saw more Ovations being used live by professionals than any other acoustic brand, including Martins. They seem to languish a bit these days, although I occasionally see them in use. Other brands, such as Eastman, Seagull and Lowden (which is a high-end brand) are picking up market share. Fender also makes acoustic guitars, though they always seem a bit like ‚Äòthe kind of acoustic guitar an electric guitar builder would make‚Äô. Yamahas have had their ups and downs over the years. 1970s Yamahas carry a lot of cachet. 1980s models to the present are great guitars, but much more priced at their value. To break into the market, they over-engineered in the 1970s. Sigma guitars are quite nice. They originally were a budget Martin brand, but Martin sold them off and now makes its own budget line (a mistake, in my view). The new Siigmas come from China. In the US, they are called ‚ÄòKindred‚Äô because of a trademark lapse. Takamines seem to be everywhere these days, at least in Europe. I would say that every third acoustic guitar I see played by a competent semi-pro seems to be a Takamine. They seem a lot like Gibsons to me, being brassier and with a heavier sound, but I‚Äôve not yet found one which really appeals to my tastes‚Äîbut, then, I‚Äôm not really looking. Epiphone makes some nice acoustics, very much on the Gibson lines (as you would expect). It could be that Epiphone cannibalised the Gibson market for acoustics in Europe. We also have Ibanez, which always seems to me like a safe choice, and Harley Benton, which is at the cheapest end. I‚Äôve seen semi-pros play Harley Benton, though it tends to be people who own a lot of different guitars. In researching this answer, I see there‚Äôs also Furch among premium acoustics. I have never seen a Furch before, and would be interested if anyone has one and can talk about it.",https://www.quora.com/Back-in-the-1970-s-it-seemed-that-many-of-us-who-played-acoustic-guitars-played-more-Martins-or-Gibsons-than-anything-else-What-do-you-think-are-the-most-popular-brands-of-acoustics-among-the-current-generation-of,"I bought a Guild at a pawn shop for $300 US with the nicest case I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm, at most, a rank amateur but all the well seasoned guitarist that ever play my Guild were blown away at what a good guitar it is. It retailed from around $1500. I once played a $6,000 Martin custom shop guitar. Was it better than mine? Of Course, but it was not 4 times the price better. It was maybe 15% better. I love my Guild, but mostly play my electrics.","Alvarez produces a decent line of guitars, from inexpensive to all solid wood professional grade. I have a Grand Auditorium cedar top model that sounds very warm and clear, and the neck is the most comfortable of all my guitars.","I have a Montana made Gibson Hummingbird, electric acoustic, and a D37 Martin. The tone on the Hummingbird is rather nice, but the finish is dulling, and to me, not what it should be for such an expensive guitar. The Martin has slightly different, but clearly balanced rich tone, and the finish is impeccable. I should add that I am extremely careful with my guitars, and no one else plays them. Because I don't smoke, there is no excuse for the finish failure on the Hummingbird. I also have an Alvarez AD80 with a solid spruce top (made in China) that I purchased brand new as substitution for a Yairi that cost (at the time) $1200 plus tax. I could not afford the Yairi. The tone on the Alvarez is very close to that of the Yairi, and it cost about half as much. I need to point out that I bought this guitar purely on its own merits, and I never looked at the label to find out where it was made until I got it home. I was surprised (maybe not) that it is a Chinese instrument. There is real MOP binding on the top, and it is beautiful. I have owned MIJ Alvarez acoustics over time, and they are very nice guitars. Their upper range models can rival most well known top brands. I would not recommend getting the 70s or 80s models that had the adjustable bridge saddle with the 2 screws.","Having worked at Sam Ash in NYC for two years setting up guitars, I would say the most popular acoustics are Martin, Taylor, Gibson, and to a lesser extent, Guild, Takamine, Epiphone, Seagull and Yamaha. Martin, Gibson and Taylor all retain fairly strong resale value and a fairly high celebrity artist roster. Guild, which I personally own and favor, have a lower profile and their ownership has changed hands several times, although its current Cordoba ownership appears to be stable enough for it to grow back to some former glory. Takamine has benefited from good QC and celebrity ties with people like Springsteen, Garth Brooks, and Eagles, among others. Epiphone‚Äôs budget versions of Gibson models and their own models, like the Texan, were popularized by Paul McCartney and Peter Frampton.","Martins are elusive in Taiwan. They sound good, and are fairly traditional. They are also very expensive (a D28 costs over 5000USD in Taiwan for example). As far as serviceability goes, it‚Äôs about the same as a traditional guitar. Meaning if it develops a soundboard belly (a very likely scenario in Taiwan), it will require a neck reset. Anything below (Mexican made Martins) sounds tinny and needs to be plugged in to sound good. Taylor is very good from a serviceability standpoint. The NT neck is removable by undoing some bolts and the shim can either be replaced, or sanded/taped to adjust your neck angle to anything you need. This is important for a high humidity country as factory neck angle isn‚Äôt adequate. Even low end (Mexican made) Taylors sound very good. I haven‚Äôt played higher end Taylors. Current model Gibsons are overpriced, and doesn‚Äôt sound all that good for its price. Especially the J200 series sounded too bassy when bracing and soundboard thickness should be done in such a way to retain the highs. Classic Gibsons sound great. Like Martins if the soundboard is bellied, a neck reset is required which is a major operation, particularly on a brand new guitar. All the sigmas are ok guitars, better than Mexican made Martins but not nearly as good as a D28 type guitar. But most of the ones I saw at the store has serious neck angle issue. I have not seen a Guild, repaired one, didn‚Äôt do a good repair on it because the owner tried to reglue the bridge with Titebond II. If you know anything about Titebond II, is that it‚Äôs heat and moisture resistant. Good luck removing it without damage!"

Italian Restaurant,How do Italian restaurants make that good tomato sauce? (It has a way more intense tomato flavor than the sauce made at home.),"There are a lot of differing opinions here. It's true, no two tomato sauces are going to be the same! ‚ÄúGood‚Äù tomato sauce is a matter of opinion. While you may like to add basil leaves at the beginning, I personally don't like to cook green herbs because I find it makes my sauce bitter. You might like to add aromatics beside onion, and I like my sauce to be less complicated. There are a few ways you can ensure you are creating an infrastructure you can build upon, a simple frame for a basic basic tomato sauce that you can then evolve on your own, and pass down to your grandkids who'll idolize your food above all others. First, it's all about quality. If you prefer canned, get the best you can, it's not always about price but that's a good place to start. delicious canned tomatoes will NOT be cheap. My reccomendation would be the actual San Marzano brand San marzanos, which are sold at Whole Foods. They are the best I've tasted so far, and relatively inexpensive. If you prefer to use fresh, there are literally none better than those you grow yourself, especially during the season in the warm months when the fruit are absolutely bursting with juices. If you don't grow them, look for them in Summer months. At a farmers market they will be sold slightly under ripe. Don't use them right away, keep them on a sheet pan in the dark, or a paper bag for a couple days until they almost split, they will seem as though they are on the cusp of going bad, that is when they are at their peak. As for the garlic, basil, whatever else you want to use, get it in season, and without pesticides or chemicals. Regardless of the health risks, they will incorporate off flavors into your sauce. Get the best of the best, fight people off for it! If green garlic is in season, use it. If basil isn't available, leave it out, put something else in. The worlds your oyster here. I prefer onion, garlic, and sometimes oregano. As far as the cooking, there are a lot of things that affect the outcome, but almost every situation requires you cook for an extended period of time. Wine or no wine, canned or fresh tomatoes, more or less veggies, you have to marry all the flavors which will take anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour. Saut√© the solids, put in your aromatics, then the rest, and taste right away. It will taste like shit. But that's the first step on its journey. Simmer, season lightly because it will reduce, then taste again in fifteen or so minutes. Tiny bit better? That's science! Once things are all happy, finish with your chosen final ingredients, personally I add about a table spoon of sugar per quart of sauce (IMPORTANT) to round out the harsh acidic edges from the tomatoes and finish with a healthy glug of super high quality extra virgin (off the heat!) and a nice knob of butter, again for smooth rounded flavor, but remember, it's up to you. If you can stand it, let it cool and wait a day before using it. The cooling process will allow the sauce to settle and get comfy. Try your new tomato sauce in a simple pasta, heat a few ounces of pasta in boiling salted water, and a few ounces of the sauce in a pan, dilute a bit with pasta water and let develop a sheen on top, dump pasta into saute pan and toss to incorporate. When the starches develop and the pasta relaxes into the edges of the pan, finish with a small knob of butter, some green herbs from your garden, and a healthy drizzle of that expensive extra virgin. Easy peasy. And don't ever let anyone tell you how food MUST be. Figure it out for yourself and have more fun than them!

Blizzard Lawsuit,What celebrations almost turned into catastrophes?,"Cleveland Baloonfest  On 27th September 1986, United Way (a nonprofit organisation) of Cleveland, Ohio, planned a fundraiser publicity stunt with an idea that seemed relatively harmless at inception; it was a stunt to set a new world record by releasing one and half million balloons at the same time. What could possibly go wrong, you ask? Almost everything. I think this event crossed the line from almost a catastrophe to a catastrophe. The stunt was coordinated by Balloonart by Treb, a Los Angeles-based company headed by Treb Heining, which spent six months preparing for it. I mean, all this makes this event pretty sad, considering how it was done with a noble goal involving thousands of people and a lot of planning and execution. But if only they had attended their science classes!  Launching of the balloons The thought behind the stunt was that generally, a helium-filled latex balloon that is released outdoors will stay aloft long enough to be fully deflated before it descends to Earth. But, as luck would have it, the balloons ran into a weather front of cool air and rain and subsequently dropped towards the ground, still inflated, wreaking havoc. Due to this unexpected turn of events, all hell broke loose resulting in the following consequences: Clogging of land and waterways of Northern Ohio. Two fishermen had gone out on September 26, were reported missing by their families on the day of the event. A search-and-rescue boat crew tried to spot the fishermen floating in the lake, but Guard officials said balloons in the water made it impossible to see whether anyone was in the lake and tragically both the fishermen died. Some balloons landed on a pasture, which spooked the Arabian horses present there, and they allegedly suffered injuries. Burke Lakefront Airport had to shut down a runway for half an hour after balloons landed there. Traffic collisions were also reported ""as drivers swerved to avoid slow motion blizzards of multicolored orbs or took their eyes off the road to gawk at the overhead spectacle‚Äù. As a result of all the above consequences, the organizers and the city faced lawsuits seeking millions of dollars in damages. After 36 years, the disastrous world record still belongs to this event, thankfully. ",https://www.quora.com/What-celebrations-almost-turned-into-catastrophes,"Wow‚Ä¶..what a CF.

Blizzard Lawsuit,What have Activision Blizzard done to avoid an Auto Chess or DOTA style repeat with Warcraft 3: Reforged?,"First of all, I‚Äôd like to say one thing. Lawyers do always have that  Sadim Touch  that turns everything it touches into ****.  For those who don‚Äôt know, the game  Defense of the Ancients  was a custom game designed using the  Warcraft III  map editor. The game became hugely popular. It was speculated that Blizzard wanted to hire icefrog (the lead modder at the time) to make a commercialized DOTA, but they couldn't get a deal; I suspect Blizzard didn't expect the value of the game and let it go. But then icefrog went to make  DOTA2  for Valve, causing Blizzard to get very angry at this. A lawsuit between the two game companies happened and I'm sure there was courtroom drama about defining IP which I don't know and won't go on about.  The result was that Valve ‚Äúwon.‚Äù  They got to continue making DOTA2, but Blizzard was able to keep the name DOTA for non-commercial use. But they clearly wanted more than that.  (Several other people affiliated with DOTA also went on the other path and made  League of Legends ) Eventually, Blizzard made  Heroes of the Storm . Now, if anyone follows Blizzard, you would sense that  Blizzard is extremely extremely salty over the whole issue.  The genre already became soaked up by  LOL  and  DOTA2 . This meant HOTS never became popular.  Blizzard always felt that could've been them making those billions of dollars, but history is history.  The new Warcraft III user agreement changed the wording and made it very strict. Basically, any mods created using the Warcraft III editor belongs in entirety to Blizzard. They don't need to fight a legal battle or play auction with the modders should a similar situation arise; they can effectively choose to confiscate it at their whim.

Blizzard Lawsuit,What is the biggest mistake that a big company has made?,"COMPANY : Blizzard MISTAKE : Not supporting DOTA  Blizzard is well-known for making a lot of cool games such as the the Warcraft series and Overwatch. But I think there was a point when Blizzard became arrogant and let an opportunity go, in this case DOTA. DOTA (Defense of The Ancient) was a fan-made game that was developed by ‚ÄúIce Frog‚Äù , ‚ÄúEul‚Äù and Steve Mescon from the the Warcraft3 game. This ‚Äúmod‚Äù game had a bast number of players and had its own competition in Blizzard‚Äôs event. DOTA was probably one of the best free ‚Äúmod‚Äù games in its era. But Blizzard did not respond well to the game because they thought Warcraft3 was dead and they wanted to focus on developing WOW (World of Warcraft). Then some developers from DOTA worked for other companys and made similar games similar to DOTA. Steve ‚ÄúPendragon‚Äù Mescon made League of Legends with Riot and ‚ÄúIce Frog‚Äù made DOTA2 with Valve. Then these two games grew so fast and Blizzard realized they had made a mistake. Blizzard attempted a lawsuit against Valve because they took ‚ÄúDOTA‚Äù name on their game. But in the end Blizzard can keep original name for Dota (Defense of the ancient) while Valve took DOTA2 name.  Finally DOTA2 and League of Legends become two best online games in the world and had their own e-sport competition with big prize pool while Blizzard tried to made game like Dota called HOS (Heroes of the storm).

Ibanez Series S,What are the best intermediate level electric guitars for under $500?,"Beyond getting something really inexpensive like a First Act, guitars are more about tone and playability than they are about some sort of gamification so it depends on what type of music you want to play. That‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt play jazz on an Ibanez or metal on a hollowbody, but certain guitars have certain tones that lend themselves more to the idea of how a guitar should sound in a certain setting. So, for guitars under $500, you‚Äôve got quite a range, especially if you choose to go used. For all around, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with getting a Mexican Strat. Nice tone, decent playability, solidly built. I‚Äôve still got mine from the early 90‚Äôs and I still love it. Plus, Strats are popular and you can easily customize your guitar.  For heavier rock, perhaps an Ibanez RGA would suit you. They tend to have a bit more of a nasally sound, but Ibanez guitars are pretty lightning fast on the neck.  For jazz, I would go with a hollow body like the Epiphone Joe Pass or something like that. Fairly inexpensive with a solid neck and a nice deep tone.  For acoustics, I would go with a Taylor GS Mini or Martin X Series (not the backpacker though - that‚Äôs a piece of shit). Both manufacturers make excellent sounding acoustics and you will definitely notice the richness over a more inexpensive one. If you can‚Äôt find them new for under $500, you can probably get one used.   Ultimately though, you‚Äôve got a lot more questions to ask than just price. Furthermore, this isn‚Äôt a question that anyone on here can definitively answer because choosing a guitar is a very personal choice. If I had $500 and needed a guitar to fit a particular style, I would probably start by looking at one of the above, but it might not necessarily be the one I eventually choose.",https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-intermediate-level-electric-guitars-for-under-500,,,,,

There‚Äôs exceptions like Gibson - for some reason the regular Les Pauls, which are a common metal guitar, start around a thousand and even the budget Epiphone version is expensive.

First one or two digits: Series, with a higher number usually indicating a higher end guitar. So an S5xx is a lower price, and level, than the S65xx. Third/fourth digit: pickup configuration. 2 is for two humbuckers, 4 for H/S/S setup, 7 for H/S/H. Last digit: Hardtail or tremolo. 0 for a locking trem similar to a Floyd Rose, 1 for hardtail. 2 is the Ibanez version of a locking system, smoother and lower in profile. 7 or 8 indicate a 7 or 8 string guitar. For hollows, I don't really know how it works but I noticed that they all end in 5 except the high end one, and all have a tune-o-matic bridge except the high end one. For basses, the first two digits tell the series and a 0 indicates 4 strings, 5 for 5 and so on. F at the end means fretless. Yes, it is hard to sort it out.

The floating bridge is a lot more user-friendly, and sticks to tuning much better than the Squier's knock-off Floyd Rose. Lastly, it looks stunning! However, Ibanez (non-Prestige) default pickups suck. You could switch your custom pups to the Ibanez to have the best of both worlds, assuming you have two humbuckers. Fair warning: if you have a neck single-coil in your Squier, that bluesy tone is something you will be unable to recreate in an H-H/H-S-H configuration.

Ichika Nito,Is there a rock musician on the way up who will revolutionize their instrument-playing the way that Eddie Van Halen did?,"You‚Äôre way too late already. Tosin Abasi has already elevated guitar playing, especially ones that have extended range (7 strings and more) to what is basically a progressive/metal version of what Victor Wooten does on bass. That means thumb double strokes and left hand tapping done so flawlessly and with minimal movement that for now it still looks like magic. Tosin Abasi is to Eddie Van Halen, as Victor Wooten is to Jaco Pastorius. We also have people like Ichika Nito, who also does tapping, but mainly on clean tones. That‚Äôs not anything new you say. Yes, but he elevates it because his tapping style is much more complex harmonically and melodically, compared to most math rock players who utilize the same techniques and voicing. He can also perform these on basically any tuning, which is a part of his act. He has also pioneered the composition and performance of short music of a high quality, something not seen since the very old days when classical composers would make music that total only a couple of minutes in length. There are also people like Chris Buck, who sound more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù leaning into blues, but what he does well is seamlessly integrate finger and plectrum playing, at speed. He is also known for using pre-bends and slides that make his passages sound like well-targeted, always-in-tune whammy bar techniques, but on hard tails. They are literally the smoothest portamenti you will ever hear on electric guitar.

Ichika Nito,Who are the world's five best guitarists and why?,"I have some less well known guitarists on my list. 5. Ichika nito. He‚Äôs really good at everything. He doesn‚Äôt make too many full length songs but his clips he uploads on youtube are bonkers. Also he plays bass better than flea, on the side. geez 4. Andrew bent. Again, not very well known, but can cover just about any song. It‚Äôs crazy. He also doesn‚Äôt write songs (although he absolutely should) but his covers are so clean. I‚Äôve never seen anyone cover the slap riff in The Woven Web by animals as leaders as cleanly as he did. 3. Lisa X. She was ten when she covered Jason richardson‚Äôs Solo in aviator by polyphia, which is absolutely insane. 2. Jason Richardson. This guy plays some extremely (and I mean extremely ) hard riffs, at unbelievable speeds and with crazy accuracy. Go look up his song tendinitis. There‚Äôs a reason that song has that name. Tosin Abasi. This guy‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs not on any top 10 lists. I just don‚Äôt. He is really good at everything. His song cafo is an example of his sweep picking and alternate picking speed. His song the woven web is a good example of his tapping abilities and also his ability to slap his 8 string like a bass. and his song Apeirophobia is a good example of his classical influences. It‚Äôs very hard to find an animals as leaders song with only one time signature, and the chord structures are very complex.

Ichika Nito,How do I make better melodies?,"good melodies are a very hard topic to discuss because it‚Äôs very subjective. To write melodies, I personally write simple melodies that don‚Äôt sound like anything amazing, and then I keep adding onto that melody. As a guitarist, what I‚Äôll do it take the simple melody I created, then add octaves, bend up to the notes I wanna play, utilize open strings, use intervals when I feel like one note isn‚Äôt enough to get my point across, harmonics, string skipping, and so on. If you wanna see a video that helps make melodies more interesting, watch Ichika Nitos video on the 10 Levels of Guitar Playing. It‚Äôs a guitar video, but shows how he writes his melodies in general. One last tip I have for you, is to always land on a chord tone (basically just the Root note, 3rd, 5th, and 7th intervals) unless you are using other intervals to create suspense for the next part of your melody. Learning new songs help you realize the capabilities you have on your instruments and seeing people use techniques you‚Äôve never used before can definitely help your writing process and make things more interesting. Listen to Waterslide by Chon, and you‚Äôll see a smorgasbord of techniques that you probably have never used before. After using some techniques from their song, everything I write is a lot more interesting. Listen to your favorite creators and recreate their songs too! It‚Äôll help your influences and start to create and mold your sound.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-better-melodies,,,,,
Ichika Nito,"Why isn't the electric guitar taken as seriously as the violin, cello, etc.?","As a person who plays both violin and guitar, I can answer that. Simply put, electric guitar is really easy to play. I‚Äôm going to use van halens beat it solo as my example. The solo itself would generally be considered a difficult electric guitar piece. In comparison, try playing that on acoustic guitar. the string tension is higher and you now have to worry about dynamics and projection. On an acoustic guitar, you can do percussion, chords, melody and bass lines all at once. (search up Marcin Patrzalek) whilst this may also be possible on electric guitar, you can‚Äôt have as much percussion and have 0 dynamic control. There is also classical guitar which focuses HEAVILY on the articulation of each note and phrasing and also has insane chord shapes. In comparison to classical and acoustic guitar, electric guitar is quite simplistic. Violin is also a hard instrument, and has the added difficulty of intonation but is otherwise similar to classical guitar. Other than that, there are certain cultural beliefs associated with electric guitar and violin. Also, search up ichika nito, the only electric guitar player that I actually like and Marcin Patrzalek, the best overall guitarist I have ever heard.",https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-electric-guitar-taken-as-seriously-as-the-violin-cello-etc,,,,,
Ichika Nito,"For most acoustic guitar music, how common is the two hand tapping technique utilized, and is it likely to be more popular in the future nowadays that more guitarists are using it?","It is used suprisingly often. However, I don‚Äôt see it becoming much more popular because of the sheer amount of creativity and skill it takes to make such a technique interesting. It is used by Van Halen in Hot for teacher and Eruption, and it sounds cool, but there is not much skill to it nor many options as far as harmonies go, it‚Äôs just same string tapping. It does not compare to how some modern guitarists use it. Guitarists such as Ichika Nito, Manuel Gardner-Fernandes, Plini, Ed Garcia (Vitalism), Tosin Abasi. The creativity and musical intervals used are inhuman, the technique is frequently used in a more much more complex way than just single string tapping, and the kind of musician magic they are pulling off sometimes will actually require the use of the skill as opposed to using it as a primary technique for writing music. I don‚Äôt see your average guitar player,or even the average professional guitar player/musician having much use for that technique, especially on acoustic, because not many can write the kind of music that will require mastering that technique beyond single string usage. I myself use it, not very often since I don‚Äôt know many songs that use it nor do I write many songs or riffs using that technique.",https://www.quora.com/For-most-acoustic-guitar-music-how-common-is-the-two-hand-tapping-technique-utilized-and-is-it-likely-to-be-more-popular-in-the-future-nowadays-that-more-guitarists-are-using-it,,,,,

It's simply a question of the quality of the player, and if you don't make an effort and start practicing, and very intensively at that, you'll never get to where you're supposed to want to go. It's just that if you are good enough, that is, close to ichika nito, then you yourself can judge which guitar is good for what you want to do. If you are still far from where ichika is, you ask which guitar is good enough.

Italian Restaurant,What's the best way to tell if an Italian restaurant is authentic?,"Let‚Äôs get one point straight: we are talking about Italian restaurants  out  of Italy, and you call authenticity the fact that the restaurant serves food that Italians (tourists or first-generation immigrants) like to eat, as opposed to a restaurant which serves food with an Italian touch that the  locals  like to eat. Is this what you meant with your question? Anyway, I‚Äôll post my two cents as if you did. First of all, I‚Äôd like to state that I‚Äôve nothing against fettuccine Alfredo or spaghetti with meatballs: I don‚Äôt consider them to be Italian food, I‚Äôm not sure whether I personally would like them, but I see no problem in an Italian chef using his Italian culture and chef experience to concoct new dishes that are palatable to his customers and add an emotional touch (Italy, Venise, Rome, holidays‚Ä¶). It‚Äôs just a matter of entrepreneurship, and hat off to those who get good ideas and make their customers happy! After all, I like a Chinese buffet from time to time, and I know that the versions I can easily find do not correspond to actual Chinese food, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt like the authentic stuff. Maybe the problem with fettuccine Alfredo is not the recipe itself, but the fact that some tourists expect to find them in Italy! Well, that‚Äôs one thing that screams: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so stupid that it never occurred to me that the world is larger than my backyard‚Äù. Back to the question, one clear sign is  carbonara . I don‚Äôt know how many recipes exist around the world that are named ‚Äúcarbonara‚Äù, but only the original one deserves this name. I tasted the French version and I found it to be a nice pasta dish, but I‚Äôd never call it carbonara. I mean, a seafood risotto can be extremely good, but a Spanish guy will never call it paella! So, in the end, look for the carbonara: if you see cream inside, it‚Äôs not for Italians. If you hear talking about carbonara  sauce , they don‚Äôt know what carbonara is at all, thus they cannot be addressing to Italians. Another trick, is to check what they use as pizza topping. If you see ananas, run for your life! No respectable chef can put ananas on a pizza. No, never, jamais, mai al mondo! An Italian pizzaiolo will always propose you the basic pizzas:  margherita, marinara, quattro stagioni  and  capricciosa ; many other options may be available, but these missing is usually a bad sign. Check the orthography of these pizzas as well: if they couldn‚Äôt write four names correctly they are of non-Italian culture, which legitimates a doubt over their adherence to Italian traditions. Still about pizza,  prosciutto crudo  must never be added  before  cooking the pizza! It‚Äôs a crime! Unfortunately, it rarely happens even in Italy. Those sinners will be condemned to eat pizza with ananas for the eternity! On the other side, maybe the simplest trick is oil. First of all, buy a bottle of expensive Italian extra-virgin oil, take it to your house and pour a few drops on a piece of bread: observe it (the texture, the colour), smell it, taste it, enjoy it! Even if I limited my answer to the most known kind of dishes the Italian cuisine offers (pasta and pizza), you may already know that Italian cuisine is vastly diverse. In particular, Mediterranean Italian cuisine is about the quality of fresh ingredients and a few expedients to reinforce the taste of the basic ingredient (as opposed to those cuisines who use a different approach and give more importance to spices and sauces). Well, olive oil is the base of Mediterranean Italian cuisine. An Italian restaurant, situated out of Italy and who caters for Italian customers, will be proud of its oil, just as a French restaurant will always offer you some butter with some bread. If the oil you see around is not the same quality as the bottle you bought, it‚Äôs either a restaurant for non Italians or just a scam for anybody. Cheers! Edit: I forgot, sorry: NO DRESSING SAUCE on salad! Olive oil and salt are always ok. Vinegar (normal or  balsamico ) too, apart from  caprese  salad (tomatoes and mozzarella).",https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-to-tell-if-an-Italian-restaurant-is-authentic,"Well actually fettuccine Alfredo origins in Rome but it was a signature dish of one particular restaurant rather than an Italian dish per se:  Otherwise, totally agree. Same goes with tagliatelle Bolognese which is probably the most faked dish around the world.

Blizzard Lawsuit,"Monday Morning has come and gone, but where are the ""blizzard"" of lawsuites Trump was going to file?","He has filed a lot of lawsuits. However, none of them involves enough votes to flip any contested state. A suit in Georgia alleges 53 votes were cast improperly. One in Michigan affects only one small county. Another in Nevada deals with only a few thousand absentee ballots. The one in Pennsylvania deals with ballots that arrived three days after the election, but were postmarked before the election. Pennsylvania says they‚Äôre only getting a few hundred votes a day. And the courts have dismissed most of the allegations. The Georgia officials confirmed the 53 votes were received on time. The Michigan suit only affects an observer in a county that went heavily for Trump. In Nevada, the disputed ballots appear to have been cast by military personnel and students who attend school out of state. The Pennsylvania one may be the best one, but Biden is still ahead on the votes that arrived well before the deadline. Irregularities have been reported in Wisconsin, but there‚Äôs an automatic recount there because Biden‚Äôs margin of victory is less than 1%. However, he‚Äôs up by about 20,000 votes so a re-count is unlikely to change anything. The irony is that Republican officials are in charge of certifying the results in most of these states.

Ibanez Series S,Which guitar brand will suit me best for playing heavy metal music?,"Tough one:) There is no single version of truth when it comes to this. I can give you an overview of some of the guitars I have played: Jackson:
Has a multi-radius neck. This means that when you're playing on the low-end or chords, pressing down on the strings would be relatively easier as the neck would be narrower and have a smaller radius. As you go up the neck towards the higher notes, the neck gets wider and flatter, giving your fingers more space and making it easy for you to solo.  Gibson:
I would stay away from this one. Not meant for metal unless you're willing to go custom. Fender Strat:
Beautiful Neck. Slim, easy to play fluidly. I would say that the neck is really ""soft"". If you have small hands, this guitar is perfect. Playing pentatonic and blues licks on this guitar is a joy. Most people would say strats aren't meant for metal - but look at Malmsteen. He shreds faster than pretty much every other guitarist. This guitar may not be ideal if you are playing stuff like Lamb of God or Arsis, but if you're more into the Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix kind of music, this guitar would be ideal. You can even play Iron Maiden on this, but definitely not Slayer. Ibanez (Prestige Series):
This guitar is the Mecca for metalheads, in my humble opinion. The Ibanez RG Prestige series was built for metal.  Super Flat neck, big frets, extraordinarily stable floating bridge. Very, very fluid neck. The harmonic response is amazing. Extremely versatile guitar - whether you're playing the screaming solos of Steve Vai or heavy riffs of Lamb of God - this guitar can handle whatever you throw at it. Moreover, considering the kind of tones and sustain you get fro this guitar, it's very light making it perfect for stage. The S prestige series is also amazing, and I like it a little more because the neck is slightly narrower and the tones you get are a little deeper as well. The S prestige looks a little more delicate, but it is a beast. Little less ""metaly"" than the RG PRestige series, but I think the neck is a little more comfortable. Parker Fly Deluxe:
The best guitar ever built. Period. I know this sounds a bit exaggerated, but trust me, this is the one guitar you'll pick up and start playing better immediately. The ""feel"" of this guitar  is the best I've ever experienced. The most versatile guitar I've ever played. And the in-built preamp is the cherry on the cake. Super light- less than 4lbs if I'm not wrong. One piece design, making the sustain amazing. Ebony wood neck with stainless steel frets which pretty much never need any sort of replacement. They don't wear out at all. The floating bridge is the most stable I've seen- and maintains its position even if you snap a string. The neck is extremely fluid - it's hard to imagine how this guitar makes playing so easy and enjoyably. The action on this is so low that you only need to touch the stings lightly to press them down. You can playing anything on this guitar, and it will sound amazing. When it comes to performing metal, this thing is ideal as you will never go out of tune even after some extremely heavy playing. Very Expensive- USD 3500+ . But if you have the money, you should at least check this guitar out. As a musician, I have no doubt that this will be one of your best investments. In my opinion, if you're new to the ""guitar world"", go for the Ibanez. Ibanez guitars are versatile and ideal for the kind of music you want to play. They are also decently priced and can handle a lot of ""damage"". I have an Ibanez RG Prestige and I love playing metal on it. Having said that, as you become a more experienced player, I would strongly suggest that you check out the Parker Fly Deluxe.

Ibanez Series S,"Why does Megatron continually keep Starscream as his second-in-command, despite his treachery?","Kind of necro-posting here, since the question is quite old. But as a bit of a Transformers fan, I‚Äôd like to add something I‚Äôm surprised no-one has said before. (DISCLAIMER: This is a ‚Äògeewunner‚Äô view, since I am not well-versed in Prime, Animated, or Dreamwave continuities. My main sources are the original Marvel comics series and the 80‚Ä≤s Sunbow cartoon, which anyway were the origin of all subsequent mythologies). Beyond whatever Starscream‚Äôs merits or capabilities for command (or anyone else‚Äôs, in that regard), it seems crystal-clear to me that Megatron  has no intention of ever being succeded, period . Make it Soundwave‚Äôs loyalty or Shockwave‚Äôs cunning and power, the question is moot. Regardless of the continuity, Megatron is fond of expressions like ‚Äòforever‚Äô, ‚Äòeternal‚Äô and ‚Äòindestructible‚Äô: he expects to be  always  in charge. After all, the Primes are an ancient lineage and succession is natural to them, while Megatron forged the Decepticon faction himself and has been his first and (arguably) only true leader. So, if you ask me, the most Megatron has ever looked for is a ‚Äòseat warmer‚Äô: someone to relay his orders and keep everyone in check when he is away or needs to send a strike team while staying behind. And most important, when he is back his command will remain clear and undisputed. Starscream fits the bill, he is like the class delegate: you know he‚Äôll watch you when the teacher is away, but you don‚Äôt expect him to give lessons. *** SPOILERS WARNING  (well, for eighties content)*** Case in point: in  Transformers, the Movie  (cartoon). Starscream throws a badly injured Megatron through Astrotrain‚Äôs airlock. The moment he reclaims leadership, a big brawl starts aboard with everyone deeming themselves worthier. Fast-forward to Cybertron: Starscream (Primus knows how) has arranged his crowning ceremony. Galvatron crashes the party and reduces Starsky to a pile of glitter. Daddy‚Äôs back, and everyone hurries to hail Galvatron, leader of the Decepticons. Starscream doesn‚Äôt meet greater success ‚Äînor succession, heh‚Äî in the comics: anytime Megatron has been absent or seemingly gone for good, someone else takes command, leaving him as an eternal second fiddle. Heck, even Ratbat held the ropes on top of him. Cannot say the murderous rampage he whent on after getting hold of the Underbase was totally unjustified‚Ä¶ But all of them, come to think of it, were  de facto  usurpers, and Megs always had some loyal (or fearful, as far as he cared) soldiers that helped him to come back. Furthermore, even then he took pains to bring his deceased lieutenant back to life. Why? Because Starscream is really good at something: he scares  the smelting pool  out of almost every sentient lifeform. TL; DR:  Megatrons‚Äôs genius in making Starscream his second-in-command lies in knowing  he‚Äôll never be able  to effectively replace him, so that his absence always creates a power vacuum and internal struggle that enables him to take back undisputed Decepticon leadership for as long as he exists.",https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Megatron-continually-keep-Starscream-as-his-second-in-command-despite-his-treachery,"Fun fact: Starscream won the battle aboard Astrotrain by hiding in a corner, then shooting the winner in the back.

Audi A3 Price,Why is staying rich more difficult than getting rich?,"Around two years ago, I walked into the Audi showroom to test ride an Audi A3. Although I was capable enough to buy the car, I had no intention of buying it but I went there just for the sake of ‚Äúmotivating‚Äù myself. I always liked luxury cars but I had never experienced how they feel from the inside. When I first sat in the luxury cabin of the A3, I was damn impressed. The plush black interiors, the nice steering wheel I drive a cheap Hyundai hatchback and A3s interiors are much luxurious compared to it. The thing about cars is that once you take a test drive, you kind of go into some kind of hypnosis where in you stop thinking logically and instead think emotionally. Although I was not technically driving the car (as I had never driven an automatic transmission), just sitting inside the car gave me that ‚ÄúRICH‚Äù feel. While I was in the passenger seat and the sales guy was driving the car, multiple thoughts came across my mind. These were the thoughts which came to my mind: What if I drove this car to work, my office mates would be so impressed. What if I drove this to the gym, I might get the attention of that cute girl I always wanted to talk to. My jealous relatives would be even more jealous when I pull up in an Audi for a family function. I will finally be able to test my driving skills on hilly sections and sharp corners, this car will give me so much fun. Apart from this there were a plenty of thoughts which crossed my mind, they were so powerful that I left the showroom with a firm intent of buying this car. However after a couple months, when my craze finally ended I started thinking logically and these were the exact things that came to my mind: Cars depreciate around 10% as soon as we drive them off the lot, meaning this Audi I was about to buy was around 40,00,000 INR, as soon as it leaves the showroom I would have lost 4,00,000 in a day. On the contrary the car which I currently own only depreciated 2,50,000 in couple years. Luxury cars are very expensive to maintain, a service would cost somewhere around 20,000 to 30,000 a year. This service cost would eventually increase every year. If there is some major issues found in the car then the cost may go up to 1,00,000. On the contrary, I‚Äôve spent less than 25,000 in maintenance cost for my i20 in a span of couple years. Luxury cars have a terrible resale value, If I plan to sell an Audi after 2‚Äì3 years it would sell for just half its original price. Meaning I would have lost around 20,00,000 INR in terms of value, that is around 6,00,000 a year. With that amount you can buy a brand new small hatchback every year. I would have always been worried about getting my car scratched if I would have ever parked it on the roadside. Getting a scratch on my current car is painful to but getting a car on an Audi gives you that next level of pain. I want my car to serve me, to lessen my worries, there is no point of owning a car if I‚Äôm worried about it all the time. Although the above given example is of a car, there are different things which people buy after getting rich just because they want to LOOK rich. Be it an expensive car, a phone, expensive clothes or watches. Buying this will only end up making you poor, unless of course you are ultra rich. This is why it is harder to stay rich, most people after making some money are in a constant race to upgrade their lifestyle. Although making changes or upgrading lifestyle is good, however one must spend on things which truly bring value to their lives instead of spending on goods just to show off. Healthy lifestyle upgrades which can be made are: Buying high quality food. Hiring a trainer to train you at the gym. Health checkups. Eating out at healthy places. Hiring people to outsource some of your work so that you get more free time. All of the above things will cost way less than an Audi but will provide you with a lot more benefits that are value for money. If you make lakhs of rupees every day and if your monthly income alone can buy you an Audi then sure, you may go for it. If you need to think a lot about buying something then you should probably not buy it, unless of course it is a necessity. The choice is yours, either spend your money to show how wealthy you are to others or keep your money and stay rich.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-staying-rich-more-difficult-than-getting-rich,"With rising traffic on roads and rising fuel prices, I think it's a really stupid idea to buy a luxury car/an SUV in today's world. The best option is to wait for a couple of years and then buy an Electric vehicle or to invest the money in some other asset and not a liability like a car.",The same thing here as well. I aimed to buy a luxury car as well during my college days. It took me a few days to analyze the problems of buying such cars in the long run and finally I have decided to go for a normal hatchback car after I am well settled a few years later. My thoughts resonated with everything that you mentioned above. Indeed the goal is to BE rich and not LOOK rich!!!!!,"I‚Äôve experienced this myself. Although I am just 18 and I am still financially dependent on my parents, I always try my best to refrain from buying unnecessary things/things which are only used to show off in order to develop the habit of saving up once I am older.","That‚Äôs a really good answer written by keeping emotions at the side. Yes, That‚Äôs absolutely right, Iw you want to become or stay reach you need to be logical.","Don‚Äôt know where did you get this kind of writing skills, they‚Äôre awesome and moreover as your action matches with your words and this is the reason why those words are always appreciated for sure and also they bring more value to our life as well."
Audi A3 Price,Why are the audi cars overpriced?,"Short answer, yes, Audi is an ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù car. But keep in mind: 1 ‚Äì Expensive is a relative term.  To a poor college kid eating ramen everyday, a $7,000 car would be ‚Äúexpensive,‚Äù but a top-of-the-line CEO could buy 5 new Audis and not even make a dent in his compensation package. 2 ‚Äì It depends on what year, make and model Audi.
A new Audi R8 costs $160,000 or more. But most of us don‚Äôt have R8 money. I could buy this 2006 Audi A3 with a 2.0L engine in my area for something like $5,000 - 7,000. That‚Äôs not expensive at all! You‚Äôd get a good brand, a nice(ish) interior, and some all-wheel drive power for that price.  But let‚Äôs say you didn‚Äôt want a 2006. How about a newer car ‚Äì like an Audi S3. It‚Äôs quick, stylish, and still fits the bill as a small family car. That would set me back  $42 - 50,000!  A new Audi RS7 will cost you $110,000 or more:  Overall you‚Äôll pay a premium for a new Audi, even the cars in the middle of their line-up cost a pretty penny compared to other vehicles. 3 ‚Äì Audi is a luxury brand, but there is a tier ABOVE.  I could get a 5-year old Audi for a rather cheap price. I can‚Äôt get a 5-year old Porsche 911 or 5-year old Ferrari for a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù price unless it had severe repairs needed. Why? Because these cars typically start at a much higher price point. And all cars will depreciate, but since a Ferrari would be more exclusive, it retains its value a bit more during the depreciation process. The R8 experiences the same thing, but most of Audi‚Äôs line up would not. 4 ‚Äì Audi is a luxury brand, and there‚Äôs a tier BELOW.  Audi is part of Volkswagen (VW). VW positioned themselves in the market so that VW, Skoda and Seat all could provide ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù cars. The manufacturer winds up sharing parts and design notes between one another. Some of the lower Audis even share the same platform as Volkswagen. But the idea is that if you are a premium customer, VW could sell you an Audi or a Porsche. If you were looking for a more affordable offering? You‚Äôd wind up buying a VW. Audi is purposefully set to be more expensive than most of Volkswagen‚Äôs offerings so that they can compete with Mercedes Benz, BMW, Lexus, Cadillac, and the rest of the players in the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù sphere. __ Overall, the typical person would see Audi to be an ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù brand. I hoped the nuances elaborated above helped to answer your question.",https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-audi-cars-overpriced,"Good answer. Here to point out that it‚Äôs not just lower Audis that are sharing with VW (or other economic brands under VW groups). Audi TT (and TTS, TT RS) uses the same platform (MQB) as the A3/S3/VW Golf (including GTI and R)/Jetta due to the space constraint.","The answer is indeed yes but actually, in some cases, a higher initial purchase price may prove to be an sensible investment if one sticks to one important principe. Buy an Audi for which there is a healthy second hand market. This will usually only be the case for models that are at the lower end of Audi‚Äôs range, say an A4. These cars tend to have a good resale value which allows the buyer to recover some of the premium he paid to have a premium car. And don‚Äôt forget: he had the pleasure of driving a nicer car in the first place.","You pay for what you get. If you drive a Camry and an A6 and experience the differences when you drive them at their limits, you will know why we pay more for Audi . They even compete in Quality with Japanse now, especially the BMW. They will last longer than Japanese and drive better than them. I have BMWs, 3 series and 5 series, which never broke down even after I put in over 120k Miles and they cost me zero for maintenance so far, except for oil and Tires. One old one, 1993, which still runs very good, passed 300k Miles with a few number of parts changed such as radiator, fuel pump, alrenator, belts, water pump (twice) and suspension. No Japanese will beat that, and I really drive them and push them to the limits at all kinds of roads. I think only the Toyota is comparable in Quality to BMW. Audi, has been good in the last 8 years, but their quality dropped lately. Still it is a very good German car.","I have the same car, but with all of the upgrades (leather seats, Bose sound system, etc.) but paid $13,00 on a 810 credit score and clear driving record. Just an FYI.","As always, I answer‚Ä¶. compared to what? My personal approach entails Total Cost of Ownership which includes Operation and Maintenance costs, insurance, and depreciation. This leads to the Ownership Sweet Spot‚Ä¶.buying a 2 year old car and selling it 2 years later. Some might not like the bi-yearly but/sell cycle, but it shows some cars in a surprisingly good light‚Ä¶ compared to their ‚Äú Market peers‚Äù. I believe Mid-low range Audis fit that description. But others are simply aghast at discovering and learning true TOTAL cost of ownership, and they declare‚Ä¶.. there are no cheap carsTHEY ARE ALL EXPENSIVE. Ultimately that all important ‚Ä¶ compared to what‚Ä¶..boils down to your personal budget. if it easily fits your budget/ life style, you likely won't see ‚Äúit‚Äù as expensive."
Audi A3 Price,What is better Volvo or Audi?,"Volvo. Audi cars are very expensive and very small inside. Here,in Latin America,the Audi A1 and the Audi A3 arrive in Volvo's V40 Kinetic Price range. That's right, the Audis cost the same price as a bigger, more powerful and more equipped car. The Swedish model delivers a much more complete package and still a more powerful engine, at a lower price. As for performance, it seems that Audi cars are very light and loose, responses in accelerations are faster in Audis...,for those who love sportiness,  it¬¥s a plateful. In Volvos, the cost-benefit is better, has much more safety and feature equipments, the R-Design versions are extremely fast,and on their price range,are one of the fastest cars in the market,for example,the Volvo V40 T5 R-Design has 245 horsepower and cost the same price that Audi A3 Sedan 2.0,which has 220 hp,the V40 is much more equipped,and has a lot of better items, but that Volvo seems working in a niche... has only few SUV (s), Sedans and some wagons, competing with a few German rivals, and not as in the other that each model has its equivalent rival (V40xA1) (V40xA3) (S60xA3 Sedan) (S60xA4) (S60xA5) (S80xA6) (S80xA8) (XC60xQ3) (V60xA4 Avant) (XC60xQ5) (XC90xQ7) However,Volvo Cars are better options than Audi Cars.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-better-Volvo-or-Audi,"Last I checked, Volvo was equipping even their R-Design cars with very skinny tires, 205, maybe 215.

Audi A3 Price,What is the biggest scam you‚Äôve ever seen?,"The Audi A3. Now don't get me wrong. I'm sure it's a great car, with comfy seats and a great engine. Problem is, you probably overpaid it. A lot. That statement doesn't apply to you if you bought the car when it first came out. At that time‚Äé, Audi decided that they wanted to  reach younger customers, most of which were on a budget . They came out with the A3 for that exact reason and  priced it around ‚Ç¨15,000 . Sweet deal, right? Too sweet actually. For many people,  the whole point of buying a premium car is to get the prestige  out of it. You don't get that when it's known that the Audi A3 is the ""cheap"" line. As a result,  very few people bought one .‚Äé What did Audi do?  They took the price to ‚Ç¨25,000 the next year , for the exact same car. What happened? Sales boomed  and they eventually sold thousands of A3's after the price hike. That car is one of their best-sellers now. Some of us obviously love to get scammed. ",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-scam-you‚Äôve-ever-seen,"You‚Äôre reminding me of a story from family lore: My grandfather was a door-to-door salesman for much of his life. At one point, he was selling encyclopedias. They were from some off-brand publisher and weren‚Äôt quality reference books; he was having trouble selling them. But he realized that the only reason to buy these books was the snob appeal of having a bunch of matching books in your home so you‚Äôll look educated. So he tried offering them at a higher price and he sold a lot more of them.","The Audi example puzzles me. The A3 is based on the Golf platform, and it never was cheaper than a Golf. Right now a Golf starts at 18,000 Euro with a 85 HP engine and a 5 speed gearbox. The Audi A3 starts at 23,000 Euro, but it has a 112 HP engine and a 6 speed gearbox. So Audi does not simply makes the A3 more expensive, they just refuse to offer some low end versions - which probably would not sell considerably anyway.","The psychology of pricing. I worked with a producer of informercials, and his company wouldn't go below payments of $19.99 because that's where they started losing sales.","It reminds me about one of bottled water‚Äôs businesses started out in my country. When it wasn‚Äôt common yet, nobody bought it for a few bucks, they thought it was cheap, so it must be bad quality stuffs. What the seller did next was just increasing the price, and suddenly people believed the quality was reliable. It‚Äôs not totally the seller‚Äôs fault, isn‚Äôt it? Mostly it‚Äôs our society‚Äôs fault to hold such belief that, ‚Äúthe pricier, the better‚Äù. Well, I rather believe ‚Äúreasonable price.‚Äù","I remember a similar--an experiment, actually--done by marketing students in my country.  What they did was go to one of the most expensive parts of the capital and sell these chocolate pastries, specifically, donuts and the like.  No one bought it.  So what they did was crank up the price and add some ""rich-sounding"" words like ""gourm√©t"" or whatever and voila! Sold like pancakes.  But really, it's not that people like getting scammed. What I learned in business school is that people also buy the ""prestige"" that go with a product."

Yes, you do have to play live at SOME point in time. But you could be a pro at home. I would guess that two of the fundamental things to achieve pro-ness at home are study and writing. You require deep study in the form of music you are seeking to be better at- whether blues, metal, classical, flamenco etc. Deep study includes immersion via listening and study of theory and practice. You could also have Skype lessons from masters who are willing to teach. There are some fantastic players today willing to teach for a few dollars an hour. Writing is important as you are forced to learn how to use a DAW, basic mixing and mastering and basic drum programming. These are very important if you want to write stuff, independent of other musicians around. Writing more music and being balanced in your self-criticism is very helpful for good growth. Take all feedback in the positive spirit- even the hard ones. Slowly and surely- you could evolve into a guitar pro.

Both come in a hatch / wagon, the Impreza can come as a sedan, and they share an excellent AWD system.  Style is really a personal preference, but the Impreza in WRX and STI trims are certainly not boring.  The Outback comes in a 2-tone that may grow on you.  You can go up to a Legacy if you want more luxury, but it'll mean a bigger car, but still not the luxury of an Audi.  The range will span $20-35k.  Get the STI if you want to be 22 years old. On a similar note, the  Mitsubishi Evolution  is another rally-inspired compact sedan.  Very much same as the STI on many points, but you can't go down a trim level without losing the AWD.  The Evo comes in at around $35k.  Get the Evo if you want to be 22 years old and think top mount intercoolers are dumb. On the BMW front, the  3 series  offers AWD (anything with an x in the name), and we may or may not see AWD on the 1 series in the next year or two.  The 3 series can put you at a price point higher than the A3, depending on trim level / options ($35-50k).  Get the 335xi (technically the 335i xDrive) if you want to spend more on a 3 series than anyone else. Something of an outlier...the  VW R32  is a relatively little known, but very cool car.  Snubbed as an overpriced Golf, its last model year was 2008 (I believe), and will come in <$30k now.  It is generally slotted into the same bracket as the STI / Evo, but considered much more handsome, luxurious, and livable.  Get the R32 if you don't mind people thinking that you drive a Golf. Close to the A3, there is the  Audi TT .  More expensive than the A3, the TT will run you $40k pretty easily.  The update to the car made it more capable than the previous version, and tried to move the styling away from the ""girl's car"" reputation of the first generation.   Top Gear (TV series)  would like you to think that all Audi drivers are jerks.  Get the TT if you have extra cash and don't mind the aforementioned two stereotypes. And finally, the  Audi A3 .  A $30k hatch is hard for many to stomach, but the car is very nice.  Well styled and very capable, it is very good option in this list. Finally...don't drive summer tires in Tahoe!  Get some winter tires, or replace your all seasons at 6/32"" (that's 3x the penny test).  All above prices are based on new.",https://www.quora.com/What-cars-are-similar-to-an-Audi-A3-compact-and-have-all-wheel-drive,"Great answer! I didn't know about the Outback Sport. Considering that I'm replacing an Outback, it might be a fit. An Impreza would be a good fit if it had an automatic option. I've been driving a stick for 10 years and I'm absolutely certain I want my day-to-day car to be an automatic. The Mitsubishi is too expensive and not my style but I'll reconsider a used 3 series and take a look at the R32. The TT is just too expensive for me.",,,,
Audi A3 Price,My friend said he bought a Toyota Avalon because it‚Äôs a Lexus ES without the price markup. Is this true that these two cars are the same?,"No they are not the same. They share a basic platform that is it. Just like the Chevrolet Silverado and Suburban share a platform but one is a truck and the other an SUV. The Platform is like the skeleton of the vehicle. Almost all car makers do this. Below are just some vehicles that share platforms. Ford Explorer-Lincoln Nautilus Chrysler 300- Mercedes E Class Chevrolet Tahoe- Cadillac Escalade Subaru Outback-Subaru Legacy Kia Telluride- Hyundai Pallisade Honda Accord- Acura TLX Nissan Marranos- Infinity q60 Audi A3-Volkswagen GTI Toyota Supra- BMW Z4 These are just the ones off the top of my head. In a majority of cases other than the frame, the rest of the vehicle is unique. The Lexus ES and Avalon share platforms, engines, and transmission. The rest is unique. Remember when Toyota ( or any manufacturer)develops a platform they take into account where it will be used. For Example, the ES and Avalon Platform designation is Global K Platform. It was designed to have the rigidity and integrity needed for a Lexus. This helps the Avalon be a better car than it otherwise could be if engineered alone. The Lexus ES has more sound insulation, much higher grades of Leather. No Plastic is used in the Dash or center console. Everything you touch is leathers or soft touch injection molded. The ES uses Real wood. All the outside body panels and interior parts are unique to the ES. They may share a radio button or some other small item but 95% of the components used are unique to the ES. Like Nappa leather, 21 Speaker Mark Levinson Sound System( on of the best in the industry). The Digital instrument cluster, power sunshades, and so many other features that are not even available on the Avalon. Then you get the Lexus service and customer treatment. Which if you never experienced, it is one of the best in the auto industry.",https://www.quora.com/My-friend-said-he-bought-a-Toyota-Avalon-because-it-s-a-Lexus-ES-without-the-price-markup-Is-this-true-that-these-two-cars-are-the-same,There is a really great book called Lexus: The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection by Chester Dawson.

So to be frank if you want the audi royalty go for it otherwise not . Skoda Superb 2016 - When Skoda introduced the new Superb which grabbed a lot of eyeballs . The styling is more classy and modern than its predecessor. The features have been improved to the latest standards . There is loads and loads of space. The boot is enormous . The engine is pretty decent to , and is the best highway cruiser in its class. But the price tag is a little hefty this time and service has always been a concern for Skoda. The VW Passat - The passat is discontinued for the time being, but its sure to come back in 2‚Äì3 months . The styling similar to Audi would be best in these 3 options .

Audi A3 Price,What are rich kids‚Äô first cars?,"From when I turned 16 up until the ripe age of 21 , my parents provided us with a new Nissan Sentra or Honda Civic to drive. Flashy, I know. They could afford more, but that would be senseless because they figured: young drivers tend to get into accidents young drivers tend to exceed the speed limit and‚Ä¶ young drivers tend to be distracted while driving With the cheaper cars, our premiums were lower and the vehicles encouraged us to not drive erratically. Any repairs were cheap and easy to fix (like when I blew the transmission of the Civic or how we wear the brakes down into an oblivion). There was also no need for us to show off at the high school parking lot. After a couple years passed,  and we demonstrated that we didn‚Äôt get into accidents or drive carelessly, I got a new Audi A3 for Christmas and my brother got an Audi S5 at around he same time:   Why did my brother get the significantly nicer car? Because my parents are paying for my college education, rent, etc, while he‚Äôs living off of a scholarship. The money he‚Äôs saving them translated into a nicer vehicle. I‚Äôve been driving the A3 since 2016. It‚Äôs a great car for the price and it would be a great entry-level luxury car to put your kids into. The S5 is amazing too. Not a fan of Audi? My friends drive: Mercedes Benz C300, Range Rover Evoque, BMW 3-Series. If you‚Äôd like more information on the car, check out my other Quora answer: John Elkhoury's answer to What car do you drive and why is it your first choice?",https://www.quora.com/What-are-rich-kids‚Äô-first-cars,"I don‚Äôt know how rich your parent‚Äôs are, but I would not have bought you a new car if I were them. Paying for your own car teaches you financial responsibility and, assuming you make your payments on time, builds credit. Its been proven that family wealth seldom lasts more than three generations. By the time the third generation comes of age, they lack the self control to make smart financial decisions. They have simply grown accustomed to spending their family‚Äôs fortune and lack the work ethic to make money. Eventually their coffers run dry and they are suddenly thrust into the job market with almost no skills or training. Riches to rags. I think you (and your future children) want to have an equivalent fortune (or larger) to your parents. To do this, you need to understand that hard work, be it manual labor or entrepreneurship, pays off. I don‚Äôt know if you have a job or if your parents expect you to pay for some of your expenses. I don‚Äôt know if your car was a one off purchase your parents made for you. If you have a free ride (I‚Äôm talking about life here, not your car,) you are at grave risk of running your family into the ground financially. It would be in your best interest to learn, the hard way if need be, that you can not live off your parents forever. They will eventually pass and leave you with both their money and responsibilities. If you are responsible with their money, it will grow and you will remain ‚Äúrich.‚Äù If you are irresponsible, you will enter a financial death spiral and slam into the proverbial ground. I would suggest finding a way to ‚Äúmake it up‚Äù to them. Maybe you could plan, and pay for, a trip they would like to take. Or maybe you could buy  them  a new car. Let‚Äôs just make one thing perfectly clear: this is not an insult. This is not some working class individual with $600 in the bank and bills to pay being jealous of a one percenter. I just don‚Äôt want to see people squandering the fortunate hand that Fate has dealt them.",,,,

Audi A3 Price,What is the point of buying a luxury car like the Audi A4 versus a higher trim of the Honda Accord?,"Two of my friends had recently purchased the below cars: Audi A3 - With taxes, dealer fee‚Äôs etc. he paid approximately 36K $ to drive the car home. Honda Accord EXL - Dealers almost always have some sort of a deal going around for Honda‚Äôs or Toyota‚Äôs ‚Äôcause they want to get them off their lot and my other friend paid 32$K to drive the car home. Now I have driven both the cars and the Honda is fully equipped with almost all the latest technology gimmick on the market. The Audi on the other had almost nothing other than the mandated back-up camera. Let‚Äôs talk interior ‚Äî Both the car‚Äôs interior feels reasonably luxurious for the price range. Of course the Audi‚Äôs badge on the steering wheel makes you feel a whole letter better about yourself as opposed to the Honda‚Äôs. But other than that not really much else wherein the Audi comes on top. (Remember we are speaking about most affordable sports car - With options the Audi‚Äôs interior can be made to look a whole lot cooler like adding chrome plated pedals, fancy color combinations on the leather upholstery etc. But that adds another few thousand dollars to the price of the car. Ride - Here the Audi is the winner in terms of acceleration and more sporty feel. But then not by that much. I am not providing statistics like 0‚Äì60 time etc. here as these can be looked online. I am merely adding my experience here. Cabin Space - Accord is the winner here by a mile. Way more spacious and more leg room for the back passenger. The A3‚Äôs interior feels cramped for passengers in the back seat especially if the driver pulls back the seat a little bit. Coolness Factor - Clear and only winner, the A3. Looks of a car can be subjective on the eye of the beholder but there is no questioning the front grill of the Audi looks really cool as compared to the Accord. I personally prefer the Accord‚Äôs side profile as it is longer and looks more like a luxury car than the A3 which truly looks like a sub-compact sedan. I feel the guy who got the Accord got better bang for his buck and will save a lot on maintenance costs down the years and better re-sale value. The guy with the Audi .. well he can always say ‚ÄúI drive an Audi‚Äù and that might well be worth the extra cost for some folks.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-point-of-buying-a-luxury-car-like-the-Audi-A4-versus-a-higher-trim-of-the-Honda-Accord,"The Audi A4 would be more of a competitor to the Accord (the A3 is a very small car and I personally rejected it after a test drive because I found it to have too bumpy a ride, similar to my 2013 Focus) in my opinion. I have a Prestige trim A4 that‚Äôs on a different plane in terms of pricing (MSRP of $52k) but a base A4 Premium comes with automatic emergency braking, leather heated seats, a moonroof, and CarPlay/Android Auto. It also costs around $36k. If you compare equipment I suspect an EX-L might still have a bit more but it is at least a fairer comparison.","I find it annoying that you answered this question with a comparison to an A3 - a car that is in the same size class as the Ckvic. When compared to an A4, the Accord loses. Plain and simple.","Not an apples to apples comparison, basic Audi compared to loaded Honda. In my opinion it is not a good idea to buy a base model ‚Äúluxury‚Äù car because they are stripped down to meet a price target. Want to drive a decent luxury car? for the same $36K buy 2‚Äì3 year old that still has full warranty (extend it if you want). Because luxury cars lose so much value in the first few years, you can buy a $80K car for half the price,,,, and guess what? most people cannot tell the difference. I have a 2014 E350 MB It drives like a dream, has all the bells and whistles and people still think new.","I'm not a big fan if the A3, I have an A6 as a disclaimer, but most of the difference you hope to never actually see. Most of the difference is in the design and engineering under the body panels and really notice the difference in major collisions. My A6 is also far superior to the Camry it replaced in less than favorable conditions. Many of the difference you can't tell on a single drive, but need to live with the car to know. I still respect Toyota and Honda cars, but they are a different car for folks with different needs. I also drive 40k miles a year, so small things make a difference to me.","While i agree with your comparison pretty much 100%, the cars you picked to compare is the issue. An accord is more of a mid-size sedan which is much more comparable to an Audi A4 or even A6. And just like the Accord has various model versions, the Audi does too, including several sport/race versions which are very different cars all together. Look up and RS4 or RS6 sedan and compare those to an Accord and tell me which you would pick. I‚Äôve had both Honda‚Äôs and Audi‚Äôs and while you can‚Äôt beat the reliability and price of a Honda, the German craftsmanship and engineering cannot be matched."

So what was shortened to 5‚Äì10 years is being done overnight stealing designer work and years of learning to do the art! if you want to forecast fashions your needing to learn how to do it professionally as the access to the market materials that you do actual forecast from is extremely expensive and limited in who gains access!

Audi A3 Price,Why is Skoda cheaper than Volkswagen?,"Simply because they are designed that way. New tech generally starts on certain Audi models, works it‚Äôs way through the rest of the Audi and VW lineup and then trickles down to Skoda. By the time it makes it‚Äôs way to Skoda, the design and manufacturing has been worked out and the price has been reduced through the efficiency of manufacturing at scale and the technology maturing. Each marque in the VW family have their place, albeit with a large degree of overlap at times. E.g. a top of the line VW Golf will likely be better (faster, better equipment, nicer interior) than an entry-level Audi A3, even though they are built on the same platform. Skoda fits into this lineup at the lower end - you get the benefit of VW‚Äôs massive investment in R&D and technology without it necessarily being at the absolute cutting edge.

It was a good car, but still didn‚Äôt get great fuel economy and never made me feel excited to drive like the Rover did. I sold it with 145k miles. My current car is a 2009 Audi A3 S-Line that I purchased with 105k miles. It has the 2.0T TFSI and S-Tronic (DSG) double clutch transmission. It is an absolute blast to drive. It makes me feel excited to drive, just like the Range Rover did. It looks beautiful and I routinely get upper 20‚Äôs MPG around town and about 30 MPG highway. I have not done anything beside debadge the car and fill a few paint chips in the hood. The previous owner had the 100k mile service done, so the fluids are new and the timing belt and water pump have been replaced. I simply get to enjoy driving it. That being said, I do have some modifications planned to make it my own ;). I think the moral of my story is that buying cars with over 100k miles is fine. Both of my brother‚Äôs cars have had over 100k miles, two of my father‚Äôs more recent cars had over 100k miles, and they were fine. Cars today are only at 1/2‚Äì1/3 of their life at 100k miles. As long as regular maintenance was performed you will be fine. You can buy lots of amazing cars at amazing prices when they roll over 100k. That being said: I performed all of my own repairs on my cars. My dad did the same, and my brother followed. This saved us tons of money on repair costs and made having older/high mileage cars worthwhile. I probably saved the full value of my Range Rover by doing the repairs myself. If you have no car knowledge or desire to work on your cars yourself, stick to buying cars with warranties.

Audi A3 Price,How do I buy an AUDI car(any) in 5 years if my salary is 30k per month ?,"About 3 times your current salary. Considering the cheapest Audi in India is around 35 lakhs on road (Audi A3) and assuming bank sanctions car loans upto 60% of the price of a luxury car, then the bank will sanction a car loan of 21 lakhs. Rest of the 14 lakhs downpayment has to  be borne by the customer that is you.  Assuming you don't support your family and the entire 30k you earn right now goes to your pocket. Let us say you pay a rent of 4k INR, your food expenses are 4k INR and your monthly savings for a rainy day is 5k INR. As usual, for reasons of insurance and tax breaks you will probably set aside 5k INR. Let us also assume your monthly pocket expenses (medicines, movie, transportation, phone bills etc) is 5k INR. So you save the remaining amount of 7k INR for your plans to buy an AUDI.  Therefore you save 84k INR yearly. Assuming your average rate of growth of income is 10% per annum and inflation remains constant at 6% (say), your real rate of growth of income is 4% per annum. Considering that you maintain a lifestyle proportionate to your income, the amount of money you set aside for AUDI grows at 4% per annum. Say, you keep the money in a high interest paying account with interest rate of 7% per annum (say).  So I ran a small code in C with the parameters mentioned to calculate how long it will take for you to save around 14 lakhs towards downpayment at your current salary, and the answer I obtained is about  11 years. Now If I keep all other parameters same and triple your salary, that is you set aside 84k*3 INR per year then I get that in 5 years you will be able to afford the downpayment. Again this is assuming you maintain a lifestyle suited to your income which means you earn more, you spend more. Otherwise even with this income you can buy the Audi in 5 years if you save 21k per month. Here is the code: #include <stdio.h> int main()
{
	float s=84000, t=84000, int_rate=7, hike=10, inflation=6, p=1400000;
	float grwth=hike-inflation;
	int i=1;
	while (s<p)
	    {
	        s=s*(1+int_rate/100)+t*(1+grwth/100);
	        t=t*(1+grwth/100);
	        i++;
	    }
    printf(""\n In %d years sum becomes:%f"",i,s);
	return 0;
} You can play with the parameters s, p, int_rate, hike, inflation and get whatever the minimum number of years required to save the amount p for downpayment for audi.",https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-buy-an-AUDI-car-any-in-5-years-if-my-salary-is-30k-per-month,What about the maintenance costs?

Audi A3 Price,"What are the cars available in India as CBU, CKD, SBU?","CBU units (Completely build Units )
 The name CBU itself speaks aloud , about itself. Completely built cars are imported via sea route into India.The companies which do not have either a Assembly plant or a platform ,provide cars to the customer by CBU.These cars are imported as the demand for the particular car or brand may be less. Our Indian government charges 120% of the cars expense as a pay to import car via CBU.For example a 10 lakh car imported into India , then the customer is asked to pay 20.4lakhs . This may seem a bit too much ,but this the only way the Indians can encourage those companies to set up a assembly plant in India. Some of the well known CBU units in India Hyundai Santa fe Hyundai Tucson 2016 (expected) Honda CRV Volvo S60 ,XC60 ,S80,XC90 Chevrolet Trialblazer other sports car like Lamborghini , koenisegg ,Ferrari Audi A8 L, S4, S6, RS5, RS7, TT, and R8 CKD (completely knocked down)
 Completely knocked down units are also technically similar to CBU , but the Car is shipped into India as fragmented parts. This requires a assembly plant in India, thus promoting"" Make In India movement"". Yet about 60 % of the cost is charged up for importing parts into India.
 But the companies wanted to offer Cars to their customers at a competitive price so they try to Localize the assembly procedure.This is done by buying certain parts of Car from Indian manufacturers , so the cost of such products does not come under CKD. Some of the CKD cars Benz takes first place in CKD by responding the best to Make in India movement. Benz has achieved 60 % localization in India. It means that 60 % of the parts for their cars are bought from India. For example Force motor supply and assemble their transmission.  A Mercedes  C  class assembly plant in pune.

Chevrolet Cruze:- Diesel jet it is, which produces more power and torque than Octavia with low pricing. Hyundai Elantra:- If you don't have any issue of power, than this sweet ride can also considered as alternate.

Audi A3 Price,Which car should I buy? Audi A3 or BMW M sport or Mercedes C220D avantgarde?,"Hey there are a couple of things you should know such as :- 1. Audi's A3 is a car that is compared to a Mercedes CLA and BMW 2 series (Not Available in India.)  2.  The Audi A4 is more in comparison to the 3 series and C class.  3. I'm assuming you're not going to buy a preowned vehicle.  4. All these vehicles are gems and have their own pros and cons.  Audi A3 :- + Looks clean and really nice in the top spec model. (Subjective though) + A very good petrol performer with the 1.8TSI and 7 speed DSG.  + New in India and a long time before it gets a facelift.  - Lacks rear space. Good for children.  - Has low profile tyres on the highest model which is not suitable for the Indian roads and can lead to wheel damage (which would be an expensive affair to replace)  - It is very expensive for its size and value factor. The CLA is more value for money with its sleek looks and frameless doors and better ride.  - Now this is something very few people know, but VW owns various companies such as Audi and Skoda etc. So when you're buying an Audi you should know that the similar engine and gearboxes in the same tune are available in the Skoda's Octavia, Skoda Superb, VW Jetta and VW Passat. So you can actually go for a VW Jetta which will be 10L+ cheaper than the Audi and you'll get the similar stuff. (Much better value for money unless what you want is the bling factor.) Audi A4 :- + It is a longer Audi A3.  - It is bound to be replaced this year end or latest by next year in India. (The new one is already around the corner in the European countries)  + You can get good discounts for the current one but most of the dealers will disagree to such new car news. So try your luck.  BMW 3 series :- + Totally a driver's car. You'll love driving it.  + Just recently been face lifted.  + M performance variant will be a hoot to drive.  + Has a BSI package which will cover you till 5 years. (Paid though, still worth it.) + Rear wheel drive to kick the tail out at times.  - The diesel is pretty noisy and in the long run can get irritating if you're a petrolhead.  - So much of a driver's car that may not be as comfortable a ride as a Mercedes.  Mercedes Benz C-Class :- + It's a Mercedes. Take it to the most remote place in the country and people will remember the star. The other 2 brands don't have that much of a snob value.  + Very new and won't be face lifted for a long time now.  + To be honest, it is the latest offering from Mercedes and is just a baby S-Class.  + Diesel is very refined and powerful and efficient. Just a mile muncher.  + The ride is so good that you won't get tired even if you want to!  + Latest interiors are a class apart and much better than competition. Leagues ahead.  + C 220 comes with a single turbo charger and the C250 comes with a double turbocharger. Pick yours. C220 is more than enough on our roads in my opinion.  + A rear wheel drive too.  - Expensive. (Subjective) Believe me I can't think of any other negative to the baby Merc.  Now the other nifty stuff.  Audi's USP : Interior quality. But as the A4 is old it's loosing it's charm. A3 isn't value for money as the Octavia and Jetta are much more spacious and everything else is same except the badging.  BMW's USP : The drive. The driver is going to have a lot of fun. But can have a bone jarring ride on certain roads.    Mercedes' USP : Ride quality is class apart. And the latest Merc's are brilliant to drive too. And the interiors are something that you can get nowhere else.  The C Class is like a combination of all the positives of the other 2 cars. I'd recommend you to go for the Mercedes.   P. S. - The dealer you buy from will make a huge difference too. When you're putting big bucks. It's better to have a good (friendly) dealer to eliminate all sorts of risks.  The more expensive car you buy the bigger the discount you gain. Bargain. And bargain hard. You'll be shocked at the  price you can get it at.  Lastly, all the above mentioned cars have a similar maintainence cost so don't worry about that.  Hope it helped.  And Congratulations. :D",https://www.quora.com/Which-car-should-I-buy-Audi-A3-or-BMW-M-sport-or-Mercedes-C220D-avantgarde,,,,,
Audi A3 Price,"What is the major difference between Skoda and VW in India, since it is produced in the same factory?","Here it goes. It's not only Skoda and VW, Audi is also included in this bunch. The Skoda Octavia, VW Jetta and the Audi A3 are all basically the same. All of them are built on the MQB platform and share the same engines. The only difference is badge value and features. In International markets the flow is in this order. Skoda < VW < Audi In India Skoda and VW are similarly priced so it's like this. Skoda/VW < Audi It is also worth noting that the Skoda and VW are more competitive in India because of their price tag. A top of the line A3 will cost you almost double of a top of the line VW Jetta.

Italian Restaurant,"What is the best Italian restaurant in Boston, and why?","Giacomo's in the South End. There are many good options, but some terrible ones too.  A rough ranking of the places I've been, leaving out pure pizza places.* Giacomo's  (the best): Huge lines in the North End; go to the South End branch.  My sentimental favorite as my old neighborhood Friday night standby.  Awesome pasta, great seafood, inexpensive and tasty wine options.  Has a great, non-tourist vibe and nails the unnecessary details -- sturdy wine glasses that feel more Italian grandmother than upscale, delicious potato cake and grilled veggie sides with the secondi.   Worth a visit:
Gran Gusto: Awesome newish place, homemade pasta and thin charred pizza in West Cambridge.
Trattoria Toscana: In the Fenway, sort of an in-between area you'd never happen to walk by but super-convenient to Fenway Park or the nearby movie theatre, and a perfect dinner before either one of those.  Only about 20 seats, delicious homemade pasta, good cheap wine.  Just ate there for the first time and I'll be back.
La Morra: Great place in Brookline Village, sort of a weird location on Route 9 but cozy once you're inside.  Somewhere between traditional and modern, seasonal without bragging about it; my dinner in May had lamb, peas, asparagus, fava beans, morels.  Yum.
Carlo's Cucina: What most North End places aspire to be, but in Allston -- no surprises on the menu, everything satisfies.
Grotto: Among the better upscale options, Beacon Hill.
Erbaluce: Newish in Bay Village with lots of buzz; my meal was only OK but companions loved it.  Felt overpriced.
Coppa: Small plates in the South End.  Not a place to get a big dish of pasta, but everything was yummy.
Antico Forno: Solid, classic North End option.  Get Modern or Maria's Pastry afterward, not Mike's.
Posto: Excellent wood-oven pizza in Davis Square.
Teatro: Not sure why this got downvoted, other than lack of commentary -- right next to the movie theatre with tasty (if slightly overpriced) food.  Best Milanese I've had in Boston.
Pomodoro: High-quality food in Brookline, awkward service. Stay away:
La Famiglia Giorgio: Mediocre tourist trap in the North End.  There are plenty like it.
Maggiano's/Vinny T's: Different places, but same idea -- big portions, reliable mediocrity of a chain, oily red sauce, loud and gimmicky.  Like going to New York and getting cheesecake at the Cheesecake Factory.  I'm not purely anti-chain (I have kind of a soft spot for Bertucci's from my college years when it was about as high-class as I got) but these places are lame. Have also heard excellent things about Mamma Maria (North End)  but haven't been. *Armando's, by the way.",https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Italian-restaurant-in-Boston-and-why,Good call w/ Gran Gusto... went there for the first time a few weeks ago and the food was outstanding.,"Ken summed it up pretty well. In general you cannot go wrong with the North End. Keep in mind that if you‚Äôre there on the weekend and a restaurant has several open tables, it‚Äôs probably too good to be true and not worth dining at. Giacomo's does have long lines, but probably worth the wait; and the line isn‚Äôt as long on a week day. I haven‚Äôt been to that many places but Niccos, also in the North End, is amazing. Bear in mind that many NE restaurants don‚Äôt accept credit cards. Save room for dessert at Mikes Pastry- the cannolis are insanely good. And of course long lines and cash only! By the way Ken, as a fellow foodie, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with showing some love for Bertuccis. Granted I probably wouldn‚Äôt go if not for my kids, but love the Sporkie pizza.",,,
Italian Restaurant,What are the best Italian restaurants in Paris?,"3 pizzeria and 3 italian restaurants There are some nice places for pizza such as L'Universit√© de la Pizza (neapolitan Pizza√Øolo) at Les Halles (an area infamous for its tourist traps) or O'Scia near Montorgueil and also Pizzeria Dei Cioppi in Bastille (also filled with tourist traps). But for if you want something else than a pizza, some top parisian chefs I interviewed for my restaurant guide recommended me those restaurants. I tested them and I was not disappointed. So here they are :  La Dispensa (near R√©publique) is a rather inexpensive Italian restaurant and √©picerie. It is run by Sicilian born Fabrizio Ferrara (who sold his Caf√© dei Cioppi but kept his Pizzeria Dei Cioppi) who worked in Plaza Ath√©n√©e Palace. Very practical joint for a quick snack or more substantial food at lunchtime or later in the afternoon. Closed in the evening. You can also by cheese, charcuterie and wine to go.
   I love chef Michele Della Valle's joyful personality. And I love his food too (he worked for 3 stars chef Yannick All√©no and in other 1 star restaurant in Barcelona and in Paris). So I would definitely recommend Sassotondo, near Oberkampf. Great products (homemade pasta and Italian products), great prices, simple but perfectly executed semi gastronomic food, great atmosphere and great area.
   And last but not least, between Bercy and Daumesnil, there is Il Goto. It's (mostly) specialized in food from the Veneto region, which is quite uncommon.

Audi A3 Price,Why do overseas Chinese students tend to buy luxury vehicles when they'll only be in the country for a few years?,"I want to buy a new 3 doors basic model Citroen C3 in France, which costs about 15000 euro. The car and the price seem reasonable for local people, and for my parents. But in China, to buy a similar Citroen car costs almost twice.
So when money is not a big issue, my parents offer the same money to buy a C3 in China.
With that money, plus my savings, I could choose a Audi A3 basic four door model in France. For my parents, to use the same money they have been prepared for to buy a nicer and safer car, is a very good bargain. And you can gain back more from a good car, when you sell it.",https://www.quora.com/Why-do-overseas-Chinese-students-tend-to-buy-luxury-vehicles-when-theyll-only-be-in-the-country-for-a-few-years,"I think you may have you answer there. For most French (or American) students, the question is not what your parents can afford, but rather what *you* can afford (and are prepared to pay). And for a student, the answer is rarely a Citroen C3 nor an Audi, no matter how affordable they are in France. Most students are just glad to earn enough to pay for this month's rent in a not very shitty place. Whatever money they're lucky enough to save up after all that, if car is an absolute necessity, they may finance a really really shitty car, or buy an old one off their parents. (I didn't buy my first car until I turned 28, a $6.5k nine-year-old Honda jazz)
So I guess it's just a simple cultural reason. Outside China, paying for a car or the rent for your grown up child (18+) is not considered part of your job description as a parent. Now if you look again at Citroen's price tag from that angle and think about spending 15k euro that you somehow manage to save up from your part-time job as a student, you may have a different view about its affordability, and why you don't see more French students driving them ;)",,,,

 I love the exterior of cars and is something im keen on observing and comparing while out on the road.  (Just a general look at the exteriors because they seem so damn similar...) Take this right here:
 HYNDAI GENESIS
  Looks clean, they ditched that coupe body I guess from earlier in the 2010's. But when I was out driving, I saw a black one and thought it was a Benz.
 Consider the following S-class

 The most distinctive feature In which these trio share are their exhausts shape and placement. Rearlights differ a bit but the general idea of each are in the same ballpark.  Lexus and Hydnai pretty close in terms of rear lights though

   __________________________________________________ So I dragged this answer on a bit too much and such, but I guess the main point I'm getting at is one that should be considered heavily prior to purchasing a future vehicle.  The current level in which car manufacturers are competing at is one that is at running to a stagnation of features. All cars that are being produced now offer incredible interiors and notable gadgets and such but the playing field is incredibly leveled when it comes to comfort.You have interiors that only higher echelon manufactures used to have access to but now, you can grab a Camry with the same interior widgets as a Benz or BMW.  This shouldn't be looked as bad thing but something will stimulate and ultimately push the automotive market to the next level. (Tesla X with Bioweapon Defense Mode?!?!?)

Anyone who has been handed sour rotten lemons by life ever since her childhood has no other option but to stay positive and spread as much joy as possible. It‚Äôs basic psychology. When you‚Äôre pushed against the wall and have nowhere else to go, you either fight back or you give up. She chose to fight the life back. She chose to stay happy NO MATTER WHAT.

Audi A3 Price,"How much does it cost to own a car in Germany (e.g. insurance, car license, and other extras that needs to be calculated)?","The cost of owning a car in Germany depends on various factors like your age, the car (power, emissions, age), your location and how long you own your drivers license. Let's start with the drivers license
The costs of a german drivers license depends on the location where you live. When you're based in west germany, let's say in Munich - you will likely pay more than 2,000 ‚Ç¨. If you live in east germany, at a smaller town there is a real chance to get a drivers license for around 1,000 ‚Ç¨. It also depends on the driving experience you might already have. Next step: buying a car
When you're buying a car in Germany you have to buy plates and you have to tell the local authorities that you're now owning this car. Combined this costs around 50-100‚Ç¨. Get your car ready for the track
In Germany, every car needs to be checked for security reasons every two years (3 years if the car is new). You are not allowed to drive a car without a valid T√úV-badge. Costs every two years: 50-100‚Ç¨ (this does not include possible repairs, just the inspection) Insurances
There is a huge amount of car insurances available, however, the only one which is required by law is the liability insurance. Prices from 100‚Ç¨ -1000‚Ç¨ per year. Depends on many factors like your car, your person, how long you are driving without an accident, etc. Also it's important to check out multiple offers by different insurance companies. If you are driving an expensive car it might be smart to get an advanced insurance. This means in case of an accident the insurance company will not only cover the costs of the other damaged car but also the costs for damage on your own car. Price depends pretty hard on the car you are driving, for super cars like the Audi R8 you pay around 1500-2500‚Ç¨ per year. Taxes
For driving a car you have to pay taxes. The amount you have to pay depends on the cylinder capacity of your car and the amount of CO2 you will produce. I can't remember the exact formular but you pay 2‚Ç¨ per 100 cm¬≥ of cylinder capacity and 2‚Ç¨ per g/km of CO2 your car produces (120 g/km are free - you pay only if your car produces more than 120 g/km). You can calculate what the car you want to drive will cost, to give you a rough idea: my Audi A3 costs 110‚Ç¨ taxes per year.

Audi A3 Price,What is the Volkswagen Emissions Scandal (Sept. 2015)?,"Volkswagen is in serious fraud mess whose initial setup was laid by Volkswagen itself in 2009.
Let us go back to 2009 when Volkswagen had been  installing elaborate software  in 482,000 ""clean diesel"" vehicles sold in the US.
To understand why they installed this software lets go into the types of  combustion engines  widely available today:  diesel and gasoline.  And there are real trade-offs to each. Diesel engines have long been popular in Europe, and one of their major advantages is fuel economy. Diesel fuel contains more energy per gallon than gasoline, and the diesel engines work more efficiently. Put it together, and the typical diesel car can travel up to 30 percent farther on a gallon of fuel than its gasoline counterpart. But there's a catch. While  diesel cars get better mileage and emit fewer carbon-dioxide emissions, they  also  emit more   nitrogen oxides (NOx) , which help form smog, and particulate matter, which can damage lungs. Both types of pollution can have serious health effects. Now to save fuel as well as to produce less pollution automakers have shown a renewed interest in "" clean diesel "" cars that,  in theory,  don't  suffer from that trade-off between performance and pollution . After introduction of clean diesel cars Volkswagen has sold more than 482,000 clean diesel cars containing a four-cylinder turbocharged direct injection engine. This included versions of the Passat, Jetta, Golf, Beetle, and Audi's A3.
Except, as it turns out,  VW was lying about its clean diesel cars. Volkswagen installed a  defeat device  or a manipulated software having intricate code that tracked steering and pedal movements. When those movements suggested that  the car was being tested for nitrogen-oxide emissions in a lab, the car automatically turned its pollution controls on. The rest of the time, the pollution controls switched off . It was a win -win situation for Volkswagen and US Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs (EPA‚Äôs) as fuel was saved and pollution levels emitted from these vehicles were not high until the regulators found discrepancies  in the vehicles while on road and while being tested in labs. The problem was only uncovered  by an independent group, the International Council on Clean Transportation , which wanted to investigate why there was such a discrepancy between laboratory tests and real-road performance for several of VW's diesel cars in Europe. So they worked with researchers at West Virginia University, who stuck a probe up the exhaust pipe of VW's clean diesel cars and drove them from San Diego to Seattle.
What the researchers found was shocking.  On the road, VW's Jetta was emitting 15 to 35 times as much nitrogen oxide as the allowable limit. The VW Passat was emitting 5 to 20 times as much . These cars were emitting much   more pollution than they had in the labs.
At that point, EPA regulators really started grilling Volkswagen about the discrepancy, even threatening not to approve the company's 2016 line of clean diesel cars. VW finally cracked and admitted the existence of these defeat devices, which had been carefully hidden in the software code. Scandal ensued. Explanation of cheating  is well known. In a car, there is invariably a trade-off between pollution control and engine performance. If the car maker were to focus excessively on lowering emissions, mileage would go up as the fuel is burnt completely, but power delivery would likely suffer. Also, while an engine running at a hotter temperature would likely lower emissions, its life would be reduced. Installation of defeat device is a type of AECD [auxiliary emission control device] which is not approved by EPA.
Failure of Volkswagen to produce diesel cars which is the ideal mix of performance, fuel economy, and low pollution led them to design a device to deceive regulators.
 After Effects on Volkswagen
Volkswagen, in other words, is in deep shit. The  CEO, Martin Winterkorn,   announced his  resignation   on Wednesday. The company has halted US sales of its 2015 and 2016 clean diesel vehicles and now has to fix millions of existing cars. It has already set aside $7.3 billion to deal with the problem. Meanwhile, VW's stock price  has been plummeting , with the company losing one-third of its market cap in the last week.Moreover,nothing is more precious than loosing the brand respect in the market and known as deceivers. In short, The company's reputation is tarnished.

The country with high road tax, speeding fines a minimum of half your weekly income (as of April), sky-high insurance and petrol (gasoline) that costs the equivalent of $5.70 per US gallon. And diesel costs more than petrol. So, as you might expect, popular cars here are economical. Definitely the  Ford Fiesta Hatchback We don‚Äôt get the sedan here thank god, but this has been the best selling car for probably about 25 years. It handles well, looks okay and is cheap in every way. Cheap to run, cheap to tax, cheap to insure and so slow you can't even get a speeding ticket. Here‚Äôs mine:   Not bad for a first car, eh? Plus I can get 60mpg if I drive like a granny. 2. The  Volkswagen Golf Pretty much the same formula but in a bigger, better built version.  3. The  Ford Focus Just a Golf but cheaper and without the quality. These handle pretty well too, apparently.  4. The  Vauxhall Astra I honestly have no clue why people buy these when you could have the Golf or Focus. One of my family members had one of these and had all manner of unsolvable issues with it.  5. The  Mercedes-Benz C-Class More like it. These can come with a variety of engines to cater for the reasonably well off to the reasonably rich.  Other popular cars include the Audi A3, BMW 3er, Nissan Qashqai and VW Polo. Mini‚Äôs are quite popular too.   Plus the French brands. No Camaros, Mustangs or pickups (except for the odd tradesman-owned Toyota). V8s are exceedingly rare because of tax and fuel prices, but for a quick comparison it's cheaper to run a Camaro SS at 16mpg on the US average gas price than it is to run a Mini Cooper S 2.0 at 40mpg at U.K. prices. Around 55% of the base fuel price here is fuel duty tax, and we get charged value added tax at 20% on top of that, so you get taxed on tax. Without all the tax it'd be about $1.60/USGal.

Audi A3 Price,What makes so many people want to move to the United States if it is as awful as its critics say?,"To be honest, it's a bit like car shopping. the United States is clearly in the premium/luxury car market as is the UK, Germany, France, and a few others. You can constantly hear bickering between the major luxury car manufacturers (Mercedes, Audi, BMW, Lexus, etc) and listening only to this would have you believe one make is terrible compared to the others But in actuality the differences are mostly trivial.  On the other hand, almost all cars sold are from the non-premium economy segments. Regardless of the bashing in the car ads the premium/luxury vehicles will almost always be better than the economy cars of price is no object. If price was the same you would always choose a Mercedes over a Toyota just as you would almost always choose the USA over Mexico. Sure there might be minor overlap in segments. You might choose a Corvette over a Audi A3 just as you might choose to live in Cancun vs Minot, ND.  If you are solely shopping in the premium class the differences really are negligible and any brand is generally very good but you will find a lot of people with an almost religious devotion as to why one is better than the other. You will see many ads claiming why the Mercedes C class is far better than the Audi A4 but either would be perfectly suitable for anyone shopping a premium vehicle. Similarly you will find many who will emphatically tell you the UK is better than the US for whatever reason...but truly the difference is negligible (I.e.: free healthcare vs more money in your pocket after taxes) lastly - premium cars seem to dominate advertising due to their immense budget over economy brands just as the premium countries dominate the news due to their economic prowess.

Audi A3 Price,How did you choose the last car you bought?,"I decided and bought an Audi A5 just last week. It is and Audi A5 Sport Multitronic 2.0T 177hp with 37,000 miles full Audi history. Before I used to drive an Audi A3 1.6 manual 102hp, which has 142,500 miles. The options I was interested was between BMW 3 series coupe, Audi A5 and Mercedes C Klass coupe. Some other possible options were the BMW Z4 2009- or Audi TT. All second hand. For second hand car buyers, here is my second car shopping guide: Negotiation : The advertised price was 9300GBP and got it for 8500GBP. Know upfront how much you are willing to pay for it. This always goes hand in hand with you not being desperate, and always having other options as well. Trustworthy : check MOT (at least in UK) online and make sure not too many wearable parts have been replaced in short periods of time. This means the car has been driven recklessly. For example, if I see they failed MOT once in 2 years due too tire depth wear I would probably stay away from that car. NO Trade Seller : Buying from trade-seller always adds an extra premium and generally can make the car over 10‚Äì15% more expensive. Further, to think you can outsmart them in negotiation would be a huge mistake, this is what they do on a daily basis. They always tried to push me different options for warranty and other BS. Drive Test : Make sure you get into the drivers seat and at least do a full throttle acceleration and a full break. If the car tends to pitch a lot during breaks, could be that the suspension/ dumpers&springs are not working properly anymore. Do as well some sharp turns, of course make sure the space is safe to do and the owner accepts this trial. Google it : Most common issues with the model you're thinking of buying. In my case seems like the Multitronic is not a reliable transmission. I saw cases when it failed at 35‚Äì50k miles, so I made sure it didn't had any of the symptoms described in those forums. True value : ‚Äúwe buy any car.com‚Äù before you even think of buying the car make sure the price is not too much higher than the one shown on car valuation websites. For a normal buyer you should play it safe and if its too low compared to that price, stay away. Remember that better pay 1000GBP upfront than 3000GBP during the year on repairs.

Audi A3 Price,Why hasn't any Indian automobile company manufactured a Convertible model so far?,"From a design point of view, a convertible on a monocoque design would need mean high costs due to high level of structural reinforcements required (yes, the mass of a convertible would be considerably higher than that of a regular sedan due to reinforcments to compensate for load bearing components like roof and B pillar going out)
This can complicate the assembly line and would make less business sense as this'll be a vehicle with higher price than traditional sedan version.. add to this the safety concerns in a country like ours (imagine a cut on your canvas roof thanks to a local thief) overall resulting in lower volumes...

Maintenance cost is comparatively lower when compared to same segment cars of other brands.

Audi A3 Price,Cars and Automobiles:  I am a 29 year-old engg professional. I am planning to buy my first car.

What should I do?,"All answers address it from the car's technical merits. Let me give a different viewpoint - the buyer's. You said your brain wants the Skoda but the heart desires Audi. My answer begins at that point, ignoring the cars and their price, merits, etc. I'm also not getting into the fact that heart had no thoughts, it's all in the brain. To that I'd argue that when we say heart, we refer to the primitive part of the brain, so called animal or reptile within you. Back to the question. My recommendation would be to go with the heart and buy the Audi. Brain cells (neurons) have been proven to regenerate and create new memories, knowledge, etc. Heart is fixed in it's thinking, and takes a lifetime to change. You'll be able to convince your brain that your new car whatever you get, is the best for you, and you will grow to like it. But you can never make your heart give up it's desire of that which it didn't get.

Audi A3 Price,"Between Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, which brand has the best affordable car?","People really seem to have avoided giving you an answer. The Mercedes C series, Audi A3/A4 and BMW 3 series are all comparable and all around 40k new. For a new car maintenance is either included by these dealerships or minimal. Any issues are covered under warranty, so none of this factors into cost of ownership. Frankly they‚Äôre all good and fun cars. It depends a lot on the model year as to how they are tuned. The entry level are virtually all Turbo I4s putting out around ~200 hp and a lot of torque, but you‚Äôre not going to have a huge amount of additional power once you‚Äôre going 80 mph+. I doubt most drivers would even notice this, or notice a difference between the three engines. MB and BMW are considered to have the most lively steering and road feel. Audi and MB have the top of the line interiors these days. Audi has the best electronics, but no longer by a wide margin. I guess the clear loser is the BMW 3 series. The 4 series is a significantly more comfortable car, but more expensive. The BMW X3 really exceeds expectations, on the other hand. Overall the differences are minute for their most affordable offerings. Entry level German sedan feels like an entry level German sedan.

Audi A3 Price,Why do GMC and Chevrolet automobiles manufacture the same exact cars?,"GMC only has trucks and SUV‚Äôs, but they all have a Chevy equivalent.. GMC Sierra- Chevy Silverado GMC Canyon- Chevy Colorado GMC Yukon- Chevy Tahoe GMC Acadia- Chevy Traverse GMC Terrain- Chevy Equinox All share platforms, but none are the ‚Äúexact same‚Äù, even though most are just minor cosmetic differences. In the case of the Terrain/Equinox, they don‚Äôt share any body panels other than the roof. To answer your question though, the reason is marketing to different tastes while at the same time keeping costs low by offering different versions of the same vehicle. Chevy is perceived to be more value oriented (but can be optioned up to pretty much match GMC) while GMC markets itself as ‚Äúprofessional grade‚Äù to appear more rugged than their Chevy counterparts, and generally starts out with more standard equipment, and higher base price to match. GM isn‚Äôt alone in doing this, nearly all car makers have platform sharing among their vehicle lines, and most also have a division that concentrates on luxury or performance. For example: Toyota Camry- Lexus ES Honda Civic- Acura ILX Nissan Maxima- Infiniti QX50 And so on.. And then you have car companies that appear to be separate, but really aren‚Äôt.

Audi A3 Price,"Apart from the VW Vento / Polo and Skoda Rapid, are there any other cars presently (or soon to be launched) in India with a 7-speed auto DSG?","Hello, At the time when this question was posted originally, which I presume was in late 2014, the 7-speed DSG or more accurately the DQ200 dry-clutch 7-speed DSG gearbox was being used, in India, in the Octavia Mk3 1.8TSI, Superb Mk2 FL 1.8TSI and Audi A3 1.8TSI. In general, DQ200 dry clutch DSG in question is used in multiple VAG cars which share the following drive-train features: Transverse engine and front wheel drive only and DSG equipped. Peak engine torque output capped at 250 Nm (irrespective of diesel or petrol). So next time, when you see a VW/Skoda/Audi car and see on the spec-sheet a 7-speed DSG, and if it meets the above two criteria, most likely you are looking at the same gearbox irrespective of the price point of the car. P.S: There are two other 7-speed DSG gearboxes also.
1) DQ500 - a wet clutch 7-speed DSG with a much higher torque output limit (600Nm) used exclusively with transverse engine layout. In India it is used in the quattro version of Q3 2.0TDI, perhaps in the Audi TT also.
2) DL501 - another wet clutch 7-speed DSG, but used only in VAG cars with longitudinal engine layout - basically from Audi A4 and upwards. It was there in the previous S4/S5 3.0TFSI, A6 3.0TFSI.

Audi A3 Price,"Why is Audi even considered as a high line vehicle, isn't it just an expensive Volkswagen?","Let‚Äôs challenge the bias underlying your question by turning that question inside-out while retaining the same meaning:  Isn‚Äôt a Volkswagen just a cheap Audi? Take this picture from an early presentation of VW Group‚Äôs MQB architecture, which was initially introduced with the‚Ä¶.. well, how about I  not  say which VW or Audi models are involved just yet. It‚Äôs not that important.  Over the past decade, the Volkswagen Group has rationalized car-building down to a few different architectures that target different vehicle sizes & markets. An absolutely massive amount of R&D goes into creating something like this‚Ä¶. you need to account for a wide variety of global car standards, different types of engines & transmissions, all sorts of safety/crash capabilities, and so on and so forth. The basic core, as presented in this photo, allows for a lot of that engineering to be shared across many vehicles, without demanding that the vehicles look, sound, or behave like any specific thing. It saves a ton of money on training & factory-building, since everyone globally will be trained the same way. Okay‚Ä¶ fine, this is all well and good and oh-so-stereotypically German‚Ä¶. but none of this actually defines what a brand  means  to its customers. Right? You don‚Äôt choose Audi over BMW because of the position of the firewall relative to the footwell, or because the engine mounting bolts are in a particular place. And yet‚Ä¶.. these are really the only things that all Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT and Skoda cars built on MQB actually have in common! When it comes time to put an actual car body, technology, engines, and materials on top of MQB, that‚Äôs where things really start to go their own way. Now‚Ä¶ yes, if you compare a 2013 VW Golf to a 2013 Skoda Octavia:   you can certainly see a lot of things in common, as it relates to the overall positioning of controls‚Ä¶. and in a few cases, the knobs and dials are pretty much the same. But it clearly isn‚Äôt just a re-badge, either‚Ä¶. every interior piece is still different. However, they are in roughly the same price range, so overall the materials and feel are pretty close. But then you compare these to a 2013 Audi A3:  It‚Äôs harder to see the commonalities. I think you‚Äôll also find that in almost all cases, the materials and overall feel of the cabin is a significant step up from the VW Golf. It also drives differently. I can verify this for myself ‚Äî I‚Äôve owned both the Golf and two generations of the A3. They don‚Äôt really feel like the same car. Does it cost more? Sure. But it‚Äôs better in many objective and subjective ways‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ so to answer your question, no, it isn‚Äôt ‚Äújust an expensive VW‚Äù.",https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Audi-even-considered-as-a-high-line-vehicle-isnt-it-just-an-expensive-Volkswagen,,,,,
Audi A3 Price,Is expensive wine worth it?,"An assertive position based on very limited data! But a little more about me, so at least you can make an informed decision. I was a member of a Wine and Food Society for many years, and President for several years. I was also a Councillor to the Australia Wine and Food Society. I attended monthly meetings of my Society where all tastings were blind (often a less expensive wine was slipped in to keep one honest). I also attended functions run by the parent Society where wines were typically in the $100+ range. I have drunk and enjoyed extraordinary wines, from the great years, and have even had some in my cellar from time to time‚Ä¶mainly when I was buying at auction and found a deal or two. I had the chance to drink the 1955 Grange Hermitage in the mid 70s‚Ä¶it was priced at several 100 dollars per bottle at that time. About 6 bottles were opened that night‚Ä¶our table got a good one but many were well past their best buy date. Even our bottle had lost its fruit and was starting to become very estery. So‚Ä¶a great and expensive experience, but not necessarily from the point of view of complementing the meal. But I don‚Äôt drink wine for the pretension, I drink it because I enjoy the experience and it‚Äôs ability to enhance the meal. It has always been so.

Audi A3 Price,"Should I buy a used car from a premium brand (Audi, Mercedes etc.) or a new car from a comparatively budget brand (Toyota, Mazda etc.)?","People that are passionate or enthusiastic about cars with less than $50 K for a car, typically don't want to spend on a Japanese vehicle. The Nissan GT-R is an example some enthusiast want to buy that is Japanese but it is way out of the budget and I would rather save my money for something else. Out of the choices you provided, I would shoot for a used Q5 or Q3 Audi for SUV choices or used A3 or A4 Sedan from Audi. SUV only a good choice if you want to have extra storage or have the extra safety that comes with an SUV. They have lower fuel economy so you will spend more on gas and are typically more difficult and less fun to drive than a sedan. BMW and Mercedes have dropped in quality over the last decade and a half and could have more maintenance issues. I wouldn't want someone to to waste their money on those vehicles unless they are ok with lower quality for high price and maintenance. Audis with Quattro system and warranty are the way to go. Plus they are good in inclement weather. Bottom line Audis are fun to get into every day you have them. Take it from a former owner that regrets trading and is stuck for the moment with another car. PS maintenance I would say is moderate for the car. Audi A3- I love te acceleration pull on this one and it's the most efficient.

Audi A3 Price,Do you prefer Audi or Mercedes?,"This is nearly subjective, as the brands have a lot of parity in many areas. I‚Äôd say Audi is much better at smaller cars and Mercedes is much better at executive saloons and higher end vehicles. That said, the all new A8 is pretty compelling, yet I haven‚Äôt experienced one in person. I find lower-end Mercedes products to feel almost cheap with their plastics and interior bits, relative to their sticker price. Audi has dominated in the interior areas for years. They are very good at giving you the impression that the plastics are of the highest quality, with lots of soft touch materials. Audi reliability has exceeded many other automakers as of late, which is a complete turn around for them. Again, higher end Mercedes vehicles are more reliable than higher end Audi models. Yet smaller Audi vehicles are as reliable as a Toyota. In my opinion, it really comes down to the segment you‚Äôre looking into. Audi A3, A4, Q3, Q5, and their ‚ÄúS‚Äù equivalents are very solid choices over an A-class or C-Class. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any car better than a new S-Class. Audi A6 models haven‚Äôt been a standout compared to the Mercedes E-Class, which is Mercedes‚Äô best seller.

Audi A3 Price,How do people really afford luxury cars? How much should a person earn to buy a standard luxury car?,"It depends on your definition of standard luxury car. Entry level luxury cars are not really that much more expensive when compared to well equipped ‚Äúnormal‚Äù cars and many models sell for less than the average price of a new car in the US. A maxed out Ford Focus Titanium has a similar cost to a entry level luxury car like a Mercedes Benz CLA class or Audi A3. If you have a college degree and didn‚Äôt graduate with a massive amount of loans it‚Äôs not at all infeasible to afford one right out of college. Generally the rule of thumb is that you shouldn‚Äôt borrow more than half your income when buying a car. Since entry level luxury cars typically start around $35,000 you need an income of $70,000 for such a purchase to make sense.

Audi A3 Price,I have to buy car which is best under 35lakhs?,"There are a lot of options in upto 35 lakhs price range. It entirely depends on which type of car you want.
If you are more inclined towards badge value than functionality then you can choose from Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Volvo or Mini. Now it you are looking for a head turner Mini cooper or countryman fits the best.
Among SUVs you have Audi Q3s and BMW X1. But mind while these manufacturers might attract with you with cheaper pricetags actual costs might go pretty higher than expected if you opt for customizations. Also many of these cars have a stripped down version just to meet the lower entry price to attract customers and you end up getting a car with mediocre features and performance with just an expensive badge.
Another option might be a full fledged SUV. Toyota Fortuner, Ford Endevour, Mitsubishi Pajero are some of the popular cars in this segment. These are full sized SUVs loaded with all bells and wishes and some great off road capabilities. They might not have the badge value but for sheer road presence they rival the likes of SUVs almost double their price. Among these currently Toyota Fortuner makes the most sense due to terrific value for money and the legendary Toyota reliability.
P.S. The new and updated versions of all these cars are due in near future along with upcoming Chevrolet Trailblazer, so it might be better if you wait for 4-6 months.
Another option is a luxury sedan. ≈†koda Superb ,Volkswagen Passat and Toyota Camry are some popular cars of this segment. These cars are loaded to brim with features and can rival cars like Mercedes E-class in terms of space. But unfortunately this segment is slowly dying due to availability of cars from manufactures like Audi, BMW and Mercedes in this price range. Customers are finding cars like Audi A3 and Mercedes CLA more appealing. But if badge value is not your primary concern then ≈†koda Superb and Volkswagen Passat are good options.

Audi A3 Price,Why are dirt rally racing cars always hatchback?,"Already answered but good luck with finding it with Quora‚Äôs search engine! The current regs for WRC favour a small car with the biggest engine allowed (1600cc). They develop about 380hp with forced induction. The bodies have to be based on production vehicles. Small production cars are usually hatchbacks. Below the WRC formulas, the cars are often sedans (Subaru and Mitubishi) because they don‚Äôt have the extreme engine development that WRC cars have. So a 2000‚Äì2500cc engine is more the go to get around the 300hp mark, and you don‚Äôt get many cars smaller than mid-sized with AWD (prices dictate that the more expensive kit doesn‚Äôt ripple down to the smaller cars). The VW Golf R/Audi A3 is probably are smallest production cars with AWD and their AWD design is not necessarily the best for rally. So the answer is‚Ä¶the rules favour hatchbacks for WRC. The majority of rally cars in the lesser formulas in many countries are sedans as Subaru and Mitubishi Evos dominate. Europe is probably a little different because the small car feeder formulas are popular, and these will usually be hatchbacks.

Audi A3 Price,Which would be a better buy. Mercedes A-Class or SKODA Superb?,"Got a comparison with the CLA. Prices
 The  Skoda Superb  is the most economical of the lot. It starts at Rs 24.9 lakh and goes up to Rs 32 lakh. The  Mercedes-Benz  CLA has a starting price of Rs 31.9 lakh and costs up to Rs 35.2 lakh for the top-spec variant. Dimensions
 The Superb clearly outdoes the other two sedans with its larger footprints. The Superb is unequivocally unmatched in this criterion. It is longer, wider, taller and also has a longer wheelbase as compared to the other two cars. However, if the Mercedes-Benz is compared to the Audi, the former is longer and hence, has a longer wheelbase as well. In terms of width and height CLA is marginally taller. As far as boot space is concerned, the Merc has a capacity of 470 litres. The Skoda, on the other hand, has a massive boot of 625 litres. Mechanicals
 Starting with the petrol engine option, the CLA is powered by a 2.0-litre engine, and the Superb are pulled by a 1.4-litre and 1.8-litre motor, respectively (all the engines are turbocharged). The Mercedes excels the Skoda marginally in terms of overall power output, thus claiming the title of the most powerful petrol-powered car of the lot. The Superb, in its manual variant, offers the maximum peak torque output of 320Nm from its 1.8-litre petrol engine. When it comes to transmission the Mercedes has a seven-speed automatic gearbox. The Skoda, on the other hand, has a six-speed manual transmission with an optional seven-speed automatic. As for the diesel engine options, the Skoda Superb is the most powerful offering with its 2.0-litre oil burner. The CLA, on the other hand, comes with the biggest engine here, but is the least powerful offering among the three. In terms of transmission, while the Skoda has a six-speed automatic transmission, the Mercedes has a seven-speed unit.

Audi A3 Price,How does the quality and value of Audi compare to Infiniti?,"They are both good in their own ways. So it depends on what you're looking for. The comparison below assumes equal price range. Of course you can say an Audi R8 is better than an Infiniti Q60 or that an Infiniti Q50 Eau Rouge is better than an Audi A3. I had the Audi A5 (Base: $40,500) and the Infiniti Q60 (Base: $40,950) in mind; both are coupes. Audi: Better Interiors Higher quality materials, better acoustics, compared to lower quality plastics and meltable dashes in Infiniti Nice lighting, dash display, tech features More Comfortable Ride Softer suspension, feel less bumps Looks fancier Stand out head lights and tail lights Expensive Maintenance (Euro cars) Infiniti: Better performance for the money 3.7L standard for 40-50k, whereas you're getting a 2.0 Turbo for that price for an Audi. Arguably stronger engine (All Nissans, dont have problems in high mileage) Higher Performing suspension Feel more bumps but tunes for better handling Looks good, but doesn't have the neck breaking power of audi. Cheaper Maintenance (Asian cars) I can go on and on, but you can see the clear cut between the two. While both are entry level luxury brands, Audi is superior in looks and interior quality and driver experience as far as tech features and comfort within the cabin go.

Audi A3 Price,What types of less expensive sports cars are similar to the Audi TT?,"The TT is fundamentally an embellished VW Golf. They share the same platform. The TT is in effect a Golf coupe of sorts. The closest match at a lower price point is the VW Scirocco - also a somewhat more coupe'fied Golf. All three cars mentioned share the VW ""A series"" platform. However, I'd have to say they don't appeal in the same way. As mentioned in Kevin Spinks answer the Peugeot RCZ is squarely aimed to be a slightly down-market TT. It kind of evokes the look of the TT but with a more manageable price. If it's the underpinnings you want then  Audi A3, Audi Q3, VW Golf, VW Jetta, VW Eos, VW Tiguan, VW Touran, VW Scirocco, SEAT Le√≥n, ≈†koda Octavia all fit the bill (indeed,  that's  how special a TT is under the skin).

I said I had a decent trade (2001 tacoma trd 4x4 sent pictures, we haggled and agreed on $7500) and that i wanted to get the finacing offer.

Audi A3 Price,What lessons can we all learn from Tata Nano shutting down production?,"Thanks for Asking  Gopalkrishna Vishwanath  sir. There are a lot of analysis that happened and will continue to happen on this topic. In bulleted points, in hindsight - Nano was a very troubled concept to begin with. This is Nano for Europe. Tata Pixel - Wikipedia  Beautiful - visionary - with lots of great ideas.  None of the ideas are about being cheap . It looks elegant. This is Nano for India.  It oozes cheap.  Unlike a better economy society - where Car is a necessity ( thanks to Corona it is becoming very fast - now - 2nd hard Car portals are Billion dollar Unicorn now) - in India it was a luxury. A statement that you belong to a higher graded society. Observe the lacklustre implementation from Indian Matrimony site:  It is termed under Assets. So, the question is - should we call Nano an asset? It is a matter of what people think - and people thought otherwise. Tata are always about ‚Äúcheap‚Äù cars, and this time - they dragged the limit. ‚ÄúReal‚Äù car folks would frown upon people buying Merc A, B class cars, and Audi A3. For many Audi A4 is not even a car - you got to start with A6 to even become an Audi. I distinctly recall having a chat with my head of India - then - in Arcesium - where he told me - he is not going to buy the cheapest car in any segment - so he bought the top model of the BMW 3 series, and he also told me he never told this to anyone else - and only telling me because only I probably would understand.  Thus the question is - what one aspire to be. Is it being poorest among the rich or the richest amongst the poor? The answer - of course is clearly mentioned It is better to rule in hell than be a slave in heaven. It makes sense for a society that confuses price with quality.  Is lots of price but no quality :  Banana, duct tape add up to $150,000 at Art Basel Miami . While this is - by any means fascinating quality - but much less price  Rajasthani Women (MTO_1550_17838) - Handpainted Art Painting - 36in X 48in But then again - for Nano it was cheap with damningly bad quality. Ownership of Nano was frowned upon. In fact I distinctly recall when I wanted to buy Hammerly AP 20 Pro - over Steyr EVO - for my 10 M Air Pistol - it was frowned upon - said at least buy Morni / Pardini / Steyr. Indian folks are way too brand conscious and I am talking about National level athletes here. There was an individual who went on record saying it is a waste of a gun. Later, my instructor told me - this gun can easily take me to Nationals and beyond - the trouble is with my shooting not the guns. The Gun for the cheapest price is dead accurate. But Nano was neither. It tried solving a problem which did not exist. Indian people did not need a tempo with 4 wheels. Indian people needed an affordable car - but a car never the less. In retrospect - the vision was misplaced. So one single lesson only. Understand what the customers really want. Rapid prototype. Be Agile.

Audi A3 Price,"Which car is superior, the 2018 Audi RS3 or the 2018 Mercedes-AMG A45?","Since Mercedes is still  preparing and testing  their new 2018 A-Class, I‚Äôll use some references from their 2017 model.  2017 A45  model is priced in about ¬£46,000 with options. I expect that the 2018 model has the price in about the same range.  2018 Audi RS3  has about the same price, also with options loaded.  Oooooh‚Ä¶ going to be hard-fought hot hatch battle here. Audi brought the most powerful production 5-cylinder engine, 2.5L TFSI, bursting out 400PS and leap you from 0 to 60 in 4.1 seconds. Well, it‚Äôs promising. In the other hand, the 2017 Mercedes boasts their 375PS, most powerful production 4-cylinder, handmade AMG engine, in a smaller 2.0L capacity. Though, it could do 0‚Äì60 in 3.9 seconds. The 2018‚Äôs engine is still unknown. So, Merc has it here. If you like neat design, go with the RS3. Non-car people will assume it‚Äôs just a normal Audi A3 with some light bodykits. It‚Äôs subtle, and could diffuse to the traffic. Mercedes has gone wilder though. It has more aggressive, killing-it, and not-that-hatch-you-should-underestimate design. People would notice that they won‚Äôt mess with the A45. The 2018 A-Class has better design, I think.  I wonder how the new A45 could be when it‚Äôs released. Here comes the verdict. Should you wait for the new A45, go with the current A45, or get the RS3 instead? As always, it‚Äôs all your choice. If you want more power, more cylinders, and want to do it  elegantly , try with the Audi. But, some says that the Audi has more understeer than the A45, so it would affect much the handling pleasure. If you want to stand out from the traffic, ripping off that famous handmade 2-liter engine, go faster, and having slightly better control, A45 is for you. If you‚Äôre patient enough to wait for the 2018 model, wait for it. Me? I‚Äôll likely go with the current A45. Not really gorgeous, but I need that pleasure of driving, please.

How do they compare?,"The A4s primary competitors are the BMW 330, Mercedes c300, Lexus IS300/350, Acura TLX, and now, the Tesla Model 3. Audi debuted an all-new A4 for the 2017 model year, with cutting edge technology such as virtual cockpit, some of the latest driver assistance, apple carplay/android auto, led headlights, and many other features I have not listed. This model has more technology than the outgoing A8 and is almost as quiet as a Rolls Royce Phantom at highway speed. It is truly an exceptional car. The Mercedes, Tesla, and Acura are all newly updated models with state of the art tech as well. Tesla has the only all electric power train of the bunch, but wait times are long and the price will be higher once the government subsidy runs out in Teslas (due to happen in 2018 I believe). Currently, the BMW 3 series and the Lexus IS are the oldest cars in the segment and are due to be replaced by new models. As such, they are behind in features and tech.

Audi A3 Price,Should I buy an Innova Crysta 2.8 ZX or an Audi A3?,"This is chalk is to cheese. These cars belong to totally different segments and price points. So I would say it depends on your priorities and how much are you willing to pay. The Innova, needless to say is far more spacious and practical. It's a great product with solid reliability. But again some find it a bit intimidating and cumbersome in the cities . The A3 is more premium and compact and gets a sufficiently powerful diesel engine. However back seat isn't the most spacious and the car is best suited for 4. Then comes the price point. The Innova costs 26 lakhs for the top end and the A3 is nearly 43 for the top end Technology variant. So yes, huge difference in price. If you need something that is a good value and fairly practical and premium, then I would strongly recommend the Skoda Superb or the Jeep Compass. They are really at the top of the game. The Superb is just as good as the A3 with much more space and the Compass costs as much as the Innova but is easier to drive and is a slightly better all rounder Hope this helps:-)",https://www.quora.com/Should-I-buy-an-Innova-Crysta-2-8-ZX-or-an-Audi-A3,,,,,
Audi A3 Price,What potential problems exist for an 8-year-old Audi or BMW? Would it be advisable to buy them?,"I can assure you there will be problems, and that is true with any 7‚Äì8 years old car. German cars tend to have more issues related to electronic components than the Japanese rivals. If the car is a Turbo charged one, the turbos could go out around 100K mile mark - more common in the BMW 3 series- 335i and less turbo failures in Audi‚Äôs. Blown bulbs, headlight ballasts are common issues with European cars (not sure why). if reliability is your primary concern, I would advise buying a Lexus , and if you really want a German car, my pick would be an Audi. (My current car is a 2010 Audi, so, speaking from my experience). I‚Äôve also owned a 2009 Audi A3 with 90,000 miles and it gave absolutely no problems during my 18 months long ownership period, it had 2 liter Turbo engine in it. There are few things you can do irrespective of what you buy, Buy a well cared car,  it should be in excellent condition inside out, clean interior, clean engine bay with no oil leaks or traces of work done. Drives smoothly, take the car for a 5 mile test drive, drive it at 65 Miles an hour and make sure the transmission is not slipping abnormally. Run a Carfax report before you buy  - ensure there were no major accidents, clean title etc. If the car had spent most of its life in an area that is less prone to rust, its a plus. My 2010 Audi has absolutely no rust, it spent most of its life in California and now its in Arizona. And,  set aside 2,500 dollars  for future maintenance, you will need this at some point and it will kinda prepare you mentally. Spark plugs, Vacuum pump and water pump are some of the common problem areas due to the age of the car (This is true for all cars, Lexus included).  If you are buying the car for $8,500, consider the purchase price is $11,000. Audi and BMW are great cars, both have its own unique character, drive both cars and listen to your heart, you will make the right decision for sure.
