We should be especially careful even when the label says it‚Äôs an alternative, because laws restrict vegan food labels from saying things like meat or cheese  but not Omni food labels masquerading as plant based food.
That being said, the grocery store omnis put the gluten free stuff with the vegan stuff on the shelf because it‚Äôs all the same to them- trendy diet nonsense‚Ä¶. They don‚Äôt think about it, it‚Äôs not on purpose.","This is 100% the consumer's fault for not reading the ingredient label. When I first went vegan 19 years ago, I read every label so I was 100% certain it was vegan. I still do it today as it has become habit. In all honesty, it is something

They started pressuring azerbaijan and Pashinyan went to visit in Tehran around the same time. They are using armenian nationalism against armenians lol.","Georgia‚Äôs national interests are to make the Caucasus a peaceful, independent and strong region where the three countries have as much independence as humanly possible. So, the exact opposite of the current situation in the region.
The transit function that Georgia serves for Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the West is important part of our national security. Inclusion of Armenia into the projects that will bolster their independence is not against Georgia‚Äôs national interests. Inclusion of Armenia in projects that deepen their dependence on Russia+Iran is against that interest.
The loss in the transit fees are nothing to be mentioned compared to what can be gained by the strengthened independence of the three countries.
That‚Äôs my two cents but I realize that the exact opposite is happening where Iran is injecting its malicious power antagonizing Arm-Az against each other even further. That‚Äôs because Iran does not want a unified Caucasus - the exact opposite what Georgia wants.",No ƒ∞ran isn't tricking anyone.

I would fake it constantly and until recently doubted myself,  but seemingly, like a zeitgeist, I understood. Now the feeling comes and goes,  but it keeps growing stronger and exponentially as things begin manifesting and I realize it is true.
Just keep at it.  Manifestation is real. Focus on the good feelings and synchronicities and once the feeling his,  you'll notice it more and more. It's important to try your best to stay away from negativity and sharing with others as it will influence you.
Like the saying,  ""find a penny,  pick it up,  all the day you'll have good luck.""
If you look at everything as manifesting from you and focus on the good things, we can more easily get into the feeling.
I think the people in Godard's time had less fear cynicism, doubts,  negative thoughts/ programming and disagreeable people back then,  so it was easier to look for the feeling and see the good.","People always say to not look for synchs, but once they start to appear couldn‚Äôt you use them to fuel the belief?",,This is so delightful to read üíõ,"Another thing about staying in the feeling for me is to not obsess or imagine scenarios as to how manifestations will happen.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Question: California DFEH vs Activision Blizzard lawsuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladviceofftopic/comments/opbdst/question_california_dfeh_vs_activision_blizzard/,"It is a civil lawsuit. The state is suing for the pattern of discrimination against women, not the individual illegal acts done by the employees and executives. The state can also bring criminal charges in addition to this lawsuit to anyone that commits harassment, sexual assault, etc.
There's a citation at paragraph 17 of the DFEH's authority to sue. I don't feel like manually re-writing that because they posted the pdf with the individual pages as images instead of text.
Yes, in every state, as allowed by laws passed by the state legislature, can sue on behalf of any resident of the state. Since the state is the one doing the lawsuit, no arbitration clause signed by the employees can prevent this from occurring.
As for who gets the money, it varies based on the statute the claims the lawsuit is using will control. In most of these lawsuit, most of the money goes to the state to cover the government's cost of suing.
This isn't out of the ordinary for the California DFEH, which is probably the most aggressive of any state labor agency in suing companies on behalf of California residents.
One notable case coming down the pipeline is the DFEH suit against Cisco for violations of the Unruh Civil Rights Act claiming two employees were discriminated for their caste, untouchables (Dalits) by managers of a higher caste managers also from India. The state is claiming this constitutes either discrimination on national origin or religion. This is the sort of case that ends up at state supreme courts. There is also a risk it could poke a major hole in anti-discrimination law if the final result ends up being that factually determined Cisco did discriminate by caste and legally not a violation of the law.",thank you!,"is this a civil lawsuit?
Yes.
why don't the California gov just go for penal charges if the law was broken (sexual assault, for example).
Activision Blizzard didn't commit a sexual assault, so they can't be charged with that. Some of their employees did, and there's a strong possibility that some of those employees may also face charges before all is settled.
Activision Blizzard did, however, allegedly allow and even cultivate a culture of sexually-discriminatory conduct, discriminate against women in promotion and compensation, mishandle sexual harassment complaints, and allow harassing behaviour to continue. That's the issue at hand, and at law, that's a civil issue, not a criminal one.
The intent here is to rein in and correct the organization's behaviour, not just the individuals' behaviours. Organizational cultures do have some independent existence even though organizations are nominally their people, and prosecutors and state attorneys recognize that. As an organization, they have a responsibility they did not meet.
The suit seeks compensation and damages (paid to the affected employees), unpaid wages (ditto), injunctive and declaratory relief (which Blizzard must comply with), equitable relief (reinstatement, for example), and costs.",thank you!,

Counterpoint: Riven.  Maybe when the thing that's Taken is big and/or powerful enough, its form is more of a hybrid between its original physicality and the black goop.

Tricking 
, on the other tentacle, is almost always one step in the correct direction within a Delta Green game...","Generally speaking, I always recommend against tricking your players. A Delta Green game is a different genre from a normal murder mystery/investigation game. Some players might want to play one genre, and not the other. So they'll either be disappointed when you reveal the switch, or else they'll never agree to play the ""mundane"" game in the first place.
Having solid, shared expectations for the game among your play group is more valuable than whatever you might gain from deploying a ""twist"" like this.","This could work for established groups of players that trust you when running the game.
Here's how I would do this: the players started out as FBI Child Abduction Rapid Deployment teams, and I ran them through the scenario ""Ladybug, Ladybug, Fly Away Home"" by Stygian Fox publishing, very slowly introducing the supernatural elements. For that one specifically, the dead kidnapper at the beginning is a Delta Green agent, as well as the team's supervisor who gauges their reaction before extending the invitation.
Another existing DG scenario that does this is Puppet Shows and Shadow Plays, where there's a stream of abductions along the desert highway with a supernatural twist at the core.
It's easy to make a few modifications to existing Call of Cthulhu scenarios to turn them into Delta Green recruiting incidents. Use the optional rules of keeping SAN tests secret, so that players have no idea about the SAN system (until they get an invitation to join DG). It's easy to think it's a game about detectives in a police procedural without the supernatural.","I‚Äôm not OP but I‚Äôm at intrigued about the ‚ÄúKeeping SAN secret‚Äù for this setup.

Have you seen the email the head of Blizzard put out today?

Then you can go to the shooting range, to test out the champs and see what do you feel comfortable playing or what you like to play.
When in match, remember to buy item, you kills, assist, capture point, healing, etc to get credit. You get 500 credit for each game. I recommend to buy 1 or 2 item and maxed them out before buying anymore.
When the match start rather walk to the objective you get a mount for travel faster.
There the talent and loadout system to customize how you like to play ur favorite character.
There the comeback mechanic in siege(the main game mode) where if you have lower point than the other team you cap faster.

I played wow from a year before the release of WOTLK up to BFA. I spent a lot of time in that game, met a lot of good people, grew very attached to my main and her progress over the years. I teared up over cutscenes, the whole bit. I finally quit after the whole thing with Hearthstone and Hong Kong. Democracy is important, and even if my one sub means nothing to Blizz, I didn't feel right compromising my principals in order to keep playing. I haven't gone back.
That said, I am not even a little bit surprised at this news. WoW always has been and always will be a boys club, from the leadership in the company all the way down through the player base. It's in the lore, it's in the behavior of the players, and apparently it's in the offices at Blizzard as well. It has only gotten worse over the years, in spite of the me too movement and everything else. I hope they actually get what is coming to them.
I will always have fond memories of the game, but nothing lasts forever and it was going to end someday. If logging on feels bad and you want to fill that MMO hole in your heart, FFXIV will feel really familiar. There are differences, WoW definitely does some things better, but it's a good MMO. The community is much MUCH nicer. The 
 of how the game came to be is everything I thought/wished Blizzard was all about.
Edited to add* I really wish someone would come up with a new MMO. Even the newer games that are coming out look like they were made 10 years ago. GW2 is another good game and it looks beautiful, but it is so different from WoW/FFXIV that it never really scratched that itch for me. The elder scrolls MMO has the best character creation I've ever seen, but something about the physics in that game feel off to me.",,,It‚Äôs a messed up state of affairs. I truly hope justice is done.,"I've played on and off (mostly on) since beta in 2003.  I've played the same character(s) for that entire time.
No matter that I've played this game for 18 years, I cannot support a company that turns a blind eye to some thing like this.  It's heartbreaking to lose my character(s), it's even more heartbreaking knowing that my money went to horrible shitty people.
I totally get why you're so sad.  There's a good reason; These people have not only ruined the lives of these people in the company but have now dragged something we love into the mud permanently.
Feel sad for a while but then feel mad.  Things won't change with sadness."

Tbh, that's kind of what it felt like to me. I grew up eating MSG added to my food, as did everyone else in my family, so the idea that it's ""fake"" and ""unhealthy"" and ""Americanized"" feels a little offensive for the food my Chinese immigrant mother would make me.",," here are three things to show to your HR.
[A law review journal on allergies and the ADA] (
)
First, MSG sensitivity is not an allergy. Allergy is a medically distinct phenomenon, and any claimed reactions to MSG are incapable of causing life threatening emergency.
Second, the ADA tightly defines food reaction disability protections only to Celiac disease and 
 allergy. Not even all true allergies would be covered, since many allergies don't escalate to the most severe type of reaction (called anaphylaxis). MSG sensitivities don't fit anywhere within that framework: all true allergies are mediated by an antibody called Immunoglobulin E, and MSG doesn't cause IgE reactions.
Third, if this person wants to go ahead with a formal complaint against you, then you've got a realistic counter-complaint of racial harassment."

But it doesn't matter how given Tzeentch holds each one by their chemically castrated testicles, at least the ones who still have them and arent a bunch of barely sentient dust bunnies.",What if the rebel against tzeench?,,"It's on a case by case basis! In the codex, we've seen examples of sorcerers that directly worship Tzeentch or one of his domains (change, mutation, etc.), performing rituals/tasks in his name and hoping for a reward. Of course, it doesn't always go the way they envisioned, but not all of them get screwed over - there's many who become Daemon Princes or are showered in fun artifacts.
Ahriman (and many others) believes that he isn't a puppet of Tzeentch, but rather the master of that whole deal, a free man. While Ahriman's relationship with Tzeentch is a bit complicated, this is wrong; he very much belongs to Tzeentch, which is further confirmed by the Omnibus. Whenever there's a sorcerer with a similar attitude, they're not only delusional, but also inadvertently feed another facet of Tzeentch - ambition.
We've also had a sorcerer who doesn't even believe that the gods are gods and thinks worship is stupid in general, but still doesn't shy away from summoning a Lord of Change (Khayon).
So, as I've said in the beginning, it varies wildly.","The thing is that SM and their Primarchs think themselves better than anyone else.

Tricking,Question for stunt performers: How proficient in tricking do you have to be to make it in the industry?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tricking/comments/q6sqry/question_for_stunt_performers_how_proficient_in/,"Tricking is not stunt performance. So, to make it in the industry, you don't need tricks at all. You need to be a good stunt performer.
That said - they primarily help with certain types of falls. For example having a good back 3/4 fall, cork fall, b-twist fall (known as an HK) will really help in giving options for fights.
There are specific tricking jobs out there, but other skills are way way more important. Maybe just your wording, but it seems maybe you think it's a direct correlation. There are a small number of trickers who do very well in stunts doubling super heroes because flippy movements are useful for those types of characters, but it's by no means the primary skillset.
The kicks, flexibility and ability to link movement are important but most important is your ability to perform in general and make things look like they are supposed to look. Most working stunt performers aren't trickers.
This is not to say that tricking is not awesome for stuntwork of course. Great to have in your skill-set, especially stuff that you can throw kicks out of (and actually hit targets). Stuff like a good tornado, sweep, 540, etc. If it's a specialty of yours, you will gain traction because of that.
However, if you want to get into stunts, I would recommend you invest in TaeKwonDo or Karate, Boxing/KickBoxing, actual Gymnastics, Judo and acting training. You need to be able to make your fights and falls look like real fights and falls.
Good luck!","This is one of the best replies on Reddit.
Ultimately stunts has become such a wide range of performing. I‚Äôve found there‚Äôs a big difference in being a stuntman and action performing.
With tricking I‚Äôd back getting good at fight choreography and incorporating your abilities in to smooth transitions. Looking up Pasha The Boss on YouTube as he has some cool interesting movements that can be added and incorporated in to fight choreo.
The other benefit to tricking is air awareness for eventually doing wire work or falls.
As for getting in, in Canada/New Zealand/America I know it‚Äôs a lot of who you know and train with. Eventually you‚Äôll be training with the right people and become a known name.
If you can put a demo reel/resume together, it‚Äôs a huge help. As a stunt coordinator, I get real tired of people sending in stuff like a headshot and resume but no display of ability.
The specific martial arts that CentralConflict suggested helps tremendously in the basic abilities expected as a fight performer.

Italian Restaurant,How come Italian restaurants in America hire waiters that don‚Äôt speak Italian?,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/q48y2q/how_come_italian_restaurants_in_america_hire/,There are no longer that many Italian immigrants.,"Because most ""Italian"" restaurants aren't Italian, they simply serve Italian-inspired food. Places like Olive Garden are mega-chains with joints almost everywhere.
Most Chinese restaurants are owned by Chinese people, and usually, it's the entire family that works there.
In comparison to Olive Garden, Happy Sunshine, or Silver King is the equivalent of an independent franchise that may or may not share the same name with hundreds of other Chinese restaurants all over the globe.
Olive Garden is to Italians what Taco Bell is to Mexicans.","Because we don't have very many recent Italian immigrants. Many Italian restaurants are run by Italian-Americans, but they're often descended from people who immigrated several generations ago.
The other restaurants you're mentioning are from countries from which the USA gets many many more immigrants, currently.","Because it's about the food, not the language. In the US, it's not really mandatory to speak the language of the area the food is from. Some people may speak Italian but it would be really rare to find a place that has all Italian speakers. It also depends on the area. If there aren't many Italian immigrants in the area, the language isn't going to be present at a restaurant. I think that many people are super into Italian cuisine but that doesn't mean they want to learn the language.
The same goes for latin american or Asian or German or any other restaurants that focus on another culture's food. Not everyone speaks what you expect them too.
(I will say it's very common for Mexican/tex-mex restaurant employees to speak Spanish, but it's not  a for sure thing).
TLDR: Americans care about the food, not the language that goes with the food. Some of the best Italian places I've ever been have been owned and ran by people who definitely don't speak Italian.",That doesn't explain the difference between different types of restaurants that OP is asking about.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Hoeg Law: Did the EEOC Just DESTROY California's Activision Blizzard Lawsuit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/q6atsc/hoeg_law_did_the_eeoc_just_destroy_californias/,"IANAL and have tried to summarize as accurately as possible based on Mr. Hoeg's commentary.
: the EEOC (federal agency) is pissed at DFEH/California and unleashed a bombshell in their lawsuit against ABK. It could blow up DFEH's entire case.
New details from the video:
The EEOC was first tipped off by a Blizzard HR employee in February 2018. They started their investigation the following October, shortly before DFEH
The EEOC settlement ($18 million USD) is the second-largest in the agency's history.
The whole ""ABK is destroying documents"" kerfuffle was due to some unclear wording in a legal filing and media not understanding it
Highlights of the new EEOC/DFEH dispute (this is all according to the EEOC, not DFEH/California):
It's revealed that DFEH and EEOC apparently had a worksharing agreement to split up the claims. DFEH would go after discrimination claims, and EEOC would do harassment.
DFEH decided not to honor that agreement and do both.
Fast forward, EEOC announced their settlement on the harassment claims in Sep. 2021.
DFEH became concerned that EEOC claimints would potentially waive their right to harassment claims in the DFEH lawsuit. Meaning: fewer claimaints for DFEH, which would be bad for them. They filed an intervention to try to stop this.
EEOC provided the DFEH with opportunities to resolve the disagreement (even though they didn't have to). DFEH didn't take them up on it
EEOC is now extremely pissed by all of this, so in response, the EEOC is telling DFEH to get fucked because they're a federal agency and don't need to listen to DFEH
For good measure, the EEOC decided to go scorched earth and bring to light a conflict of interest that could undermine DFEH's entire case: two former EEOC attorneys led the DFEH lawsuit, which is barred under California's rules of professional conduct.
Which, ethically, is extra bad because those two attorneys are now opposing the EEOC lawsuit, the very lawsuit they worked on.
We don't know when those two attorneys started working at DFEH.
EEOC doesn't give a fuck. Again, this is all on the word of the EEOC.","Really awesome and informative video, to start. It's nice to have a solid legal viewpoint.
DFEH submitting a Kotaku article as evidence is about the saddest thing I've seen in a while.
DFEH can likely kiss their case goodbye. Not honoring a workshare agreement with EEOC means that if DFEH's case does go bye-bye, then ABK gets to skate by on the DFEH's portion of that workshare due to pure incompetence.
Activision IS still under investigation by the SEC and there is a shareholder suit still out there so they aren't out of the woods quite yet, but it's a major loss to those affected that governmental squabbling might cost them hard.","Hoeg clarified in the Youtube comments that even if a judge sided with EEOC on all this, the DFEH lawsuit probably wouldn't disappear:
I imagine if the Court simply agreed with all of this, outside counsel would need to establish its own record and strategy.  The issue in respect of this intervention is timing.  They want the court to approve the settlement in relatively short order.
Further, if the DFEH is found to have operated outside of conflict requirements, Activision Blizzard might move to have the whole thing re-examined.  Doesn't get them out of any legitimate claims, but could delay things.  Really unclear what the Court might do here.",,

I'd spent so long drawing the altered version (about 2 hours) that by the time I had got his features looking complete I could not be fussed with fine tuning everything again.

Splitted the dough, preshaped it after bulk ferment, left it to relax 20 minutes and final shaped it to transfer it to the bannetons. Put it in the fridge covered with shower cap for 6 hours(until morning) and proofed it without cover for 8 additional hours to let it form a dry crust so they hold their shapes better and the easiest ear you'll ever get.

The cartoonist has had little control over his creation since it became one of the world's most popular Internet memes.
Matt Furie, the artist behind the famous Pepe the Frog cartoon, has moved into the non-fungible token (NFT) business. Now, many years after the famous frog was co-opted and became an Internet sensation, NFTs have given Furie some claim over his creation.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been good to mark my territory with Pepe here, and show that Pepe is a character that I created,‚Äù Furie told Decrypt via email.''","If anyone is annoyed by this I'd highly suggest watching the documentary ""Feels Good Man"". It doesn't take a strong political stance but mostly just delves into this guys life and his relationship to the character. It's hard not to feel bad for him and I fully support him doing this."

Pepe the frog,Pepe the Frog is your Meme of the Decade,https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/ew6oev/pepe_the_frog_is_your_meme_of_the_decade/,"Pepe the Frog is a cartoon frog created by the cartoonist Matt Furie for his comic Boy's Club.
Pepe the Frog is a series of reaction images commonly used to convey emotions.
Pepe the Frog is a hate symbol according to the Anti-Defamation League.
Pepe the Frog is a resistance symbol according to the perseverant Hong Kong protestors.
Pepe the Frog is just that, a cartoon frog, but we assign meaning to it. Pepe means something different for everyone. He can be a playful frog, a symbol of hope, or a symbol of hate. This cartoon frog has transcended common memehood and woven itself into the tapestry of our society. When we think of the Meme of the Decade competition, we should think of the most impactful memes of this decade. Pepe the Frog is not merely a cartoon frog to have fun with on the internet, but a symbol that inspires real emotions to many.
While not as common in 2020, Pepe was a force to be reckoned with in the early and mid 2010s. These days, he has found his way into many places, new and old: from Discord server emojis to 4chan reaction images, from graffitied concrete in Hong Kong to the many pages of the ADL. As we move into the next decade, Pepe the Frog will come along with us. He is no longer simply a meme but is part of the internet itself. He is part of our shared culture, and that Feels Good, Man.
And with that, I am happy to declare that Pepe the Frog is your Meme of the Decade

Tricking,Advice For Pseudo One-Tricking Kerrigan?,https://www.reddit.com/r/heroesofthestorm/comments/q6leb3/advice_for_pseudo_onetricking_kerrigan/,"If you‚Äòre in bronze, Sonya is probably the better choice. Slam build with leap, you play normally but if you see someone alone you leap them. Combo is something like Leap-W-(AA)-Q-W-(AA) then W till target is dead or E out.
Kerrigan is a strong hero but way harder to play for not that much upside. Sonya always works, Kerrigan is more niche.
That said, in bronze you 
 make anything work but if you are bronze yourself you shouldn‚Äòt task yourself with making everything work, maybe get the basics right first and that will get you a long way. I don‚Äòt mean this in a condensending way.
If you still want to play Kerrigan, make sure you hit the combo. Even with Q build (should be the go-to anyway), the combo is still the best part of her kit. It‚Äòs why she has such a strong early game: she doesn‚Äòt need talents. Everything she needs (the combo) is baseline. This means she has a strong level 1 and works really well in roaming squads. Fights for early objectives are almost certainly yours if you play well - then again it‚Äòs bronze so maybe not.
She doesn‚Äòt have the raw damage output of Sonya. You will need follow up. Someone like Jaina or tychus works really well, as they deal a lot of close range damage and your combo is the perfect set up for them.
Kerrigan is good on infernal shrines because in shrine fights you have plenty of minions to Q towards and get shields + Q resets and repositioning. She is bad on maps where the objective is isolated or has little fighting going on (Sky temple for example). She doesn‚Äòt do well with camps, but with her level 1 Q/AA talent with the splash she is okay in clearing waves.
The more I write, the more I think of suggesting to just stick with Sonya as she is more independant of your team and easier to play. But in the end you need to have fun, so if you like Kerrigan just play her.
Go Ultralist lvl 10, it gives you a long range engage or a follow up for your own combo.
Final tip: If someone is melee range, to always hit the combo: use the Alt combo. Alt+W (selfcast) and then pull. You will never overshoot the stund with the pull that way, since it overlaps with the back of your hitbox where the max pull distance is. Also use W if you see you are getting engaged upon. The delay makes it perfect for countering stun engages, since it has a delayed activation.","Leap + that combo works great for me when the enemy team is disorganized or early/mid game when they aren't staying as a 5 man and I can get ganks. Once we approach late game, even in bronze, most teams group up and at that point not only am I not going to get any follow-up on my leap by my team... but I'm also not going to be able to stay there and get off that full combo before I'm immediately focused down when the enemy team is deathballing and all together. This is made even more difficult when my own tank/team refuses to proper engage and I get to the point where they're just dancing around, everyone is getting poked down, and I realize if nobody makes a play we just lose anyway so I have to try and make something happen but usually doesn't go well.
I figured (perhaps incorrectly) that with Kerrigan I could get off more dmg faster at that stage of the game before being made to retreat, maybe even cause some havoc and open a window for my team to see they can stop dancing around and actually engage. With Kerrigan I can Q onto multiple targets to create confusion, put out dmg, get some shields, throw my ultralisk for a stun, and if I'm instantly focused I can either Q out unlike Sonya, or Chrysalis to bide a couple seconds while my team hopefully does something. Additionally by level 20 I also have the teleport that gives instant big shields on top of an enemy team. Idk, maybe I'm dead wrong but I do know that combo in a perfect world would be great but in a lvl 20+ 5v5 vs a heavily grouped team there's not a high chance of getting it all off. I usually Leap stun>Q stun (hoping after 2 stuns my team would follow up by now) > W/AA rotation but again typically its just me...",,"You just gotta grind her and learn the Kerri matchups/teamfight situations. It's a bronze account so you have nothing to lose.
Even with Kerrigan's stun and burst she frequently fights front to back vs certain tanks. For instance: I almost always target a Garrosh or Mal'Ganis first in fights unless a DPS makes a massive error.
Sonya's probably better for the solo climb because of her macro... but Kerrigan kill pressure will just make bronze players quit at 10m when you good on her.",Kerrigan has insane waveclear though (both fast and resource free) so she seems to still be useful to a team macro-wise right? It's just her camp clear holding her back in that regard?

That is, not listening in your usual position, paying too much attention. Play the track back, go off and do something else so it becomes background.

It has tons of useful advice on the overall mixing process and the mindset to try and adopt. It's super short, but it's such a dope book.",Does listening to it on your phone speakers help? Since everyone seems to listen to music on their cell phone and buds it seems mixing almost has to gear more towards those. Things that sound good on speakers or good headphones can sometimes be non-existant on phone speakers. Some synths that are heavy on stereo with the knob turned far to the left(FL studio) sometimes will almost totally disappear on the phone. The big question is do you edit it for the majority of the people who listen on phone speakers or keep it as it for people with good speakers that have good stereo seperation?,

Funny that just earlier this week this same sub had a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the worst restaurant‚Äù thread and a bunch jumped on the BLG anti deal but having been there a couple dozen times and the fact that it‚Äôs long been one of the busiest and hardest spots in the Twin Cities to get into, there might be something around that, vs what a couple Reddit folks that hate everything in life say.
Our tastes are all different. I get that. I don‚Äôt care for sushi, but I never tell someone not to try it or not to enjoy it.
Our tastes may not match someone like the group of food writers for Star Tribune but they go to 5+ restaurants a week. I‚Äôve met them and I trust their opinion far more for recommendations than others because no one I know goes out quite that much (do have a couple friends that nearly do though).
I‚Äôm always down for recommendations. We will all form our own opinions but folks you trust can at least steer you towards the decent and away from the really bad, then you can make your own call. Though at the same time, don‚Äôt ignore the between when you have time. There are too many places for us to hit them all, which is why we rely on reviews from others.

! As a reminder, this sub is for discussion, memes, and news about leaving the Left, or reasons to do so. Please follow our rules.
Other recommended subreddits include:","This is based on the environment right now and the likely trend of the Biden admin. As many people know, President Biden is in complete an absolute free fall. He had a defining moment in the worst way possible. At the same time the map I decided to roll with highlights recent trends in both parties with the Democrats beginning to lose the rust belt, Nevada, and parts of the east coast. But the republicans seeing Georgia become competitive for the moment. This also highlights that Biden has committed to being a ‚Äútransitional‚Äù president and that if he doesn‚Äôt run for re-election, the open seat tends to flip to the other party. I‚Äôll explain the rationale behind the key states/regions and why I decided to roll with them.
Note: This is generic Democrat vs generic Republican. This isn‚Äôt predicting a Trump vs Biden rematch or Haley vs Harris or any other potential matches.
Maine- Republican momentum could begin to carry the majority of the state in the coming years. For now, they have to be content with the one electoral point.
Midwest- With the current abandonment of Midwestern values by the Democratic Party and the results thus far of the Biden admin, it‚Äôs likely that Nebraska goes totally Republican in 2024. At the same time Ohio is likely already locked in as solid red at this point while Iowa will likely get carried by momentum as usual. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have been turning more red since at least 2012 as the traditional mining and manufacturing jobs leave the states.
Michigan- Michigan is also becoming redder but is the slowest to convert. There really isn‚Äôt a strong Republican to cherry pick for a VP ticket to put the Republicans over the top. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the GOP got it, but I don‚Äôt think it begins to officially lean red until 2028.
New Hampshire- The first winner take all east coast state to swing back in the Republican column. Republicans have become competitive again in the region since last capturing the state in 2000. This could build a blue print for success along the smaller and midsized east coast states in the future.
Georgia- While the suburbs are becoming more swing/bluer. They‚Äôll likely turn out to vote Republican again this time around, the disaster that Biden has created this month alone probably locks that in, not to mention future issues + a likely open seat election. At the same time the Republican Party doubled their overall black support from 2016 and stands a good chance to see another uptick in 2024. 2024 may be a one step forward two steps back scenario for the Democrats next cycle. Though overall this state is going to be a swing going forward.
Texas- The Democrats dared dream in 2018 and 2020 but with a lot of the minority vote shifting right, those dreams will probably be put on hold for the foreseeable future. This will especially ring true with the time for change model favoring the Republicans + the aftershock of the Biden admin.
Virginia- Credit where it‚Äôs due. The Democrats have done a solid job shoring up in Virginia since first taking the state in 2008. It‚Äôs become a reliable blue state. I could see the Republicans eating into the lead by way of sheer momentum.  But I don‚Äôt see the Democrats losing the state anytime soon.
Nevada- Trump experienced a solid surge in the state of Nevada and it was a bit of a shock for a lot of people. I think come 2024, in the context of all that is happening and how the Democrats will feel demobilized or even disenchanted, Nevada is set to go red. But will become a swing state going forward.
Florida- As I said with Texas, the Republicans have made serious ground among minority voters and probably will continue to do so. Being able to get into Miami-Dade county and compete is what caused Trump to have the state more or less locked up before midnight and will continue to be a blue print for Republicans in the future.
Arizona- Arizona is one of those lean red states that tends to occasionally revolt vote. In 2018 and 2020, the revolt was on clear display. It‚Äôll probably be red for 2024 given the momentum of both parties.
North Carolina- I think next Michigan and Georgia, this will be the closest of the key states. It‚Äôs one of the few southern states that can go either way in any election. But I think that in 2024, the national environment is set to be Republican leaning overall. So we‚Äôll see it go Republican by a few points.","Texas- The Democrats dared dream in 2018 and 2020 but with a lot of the minority vote shifting right, those dreams will probably be put on hold for the foreseeable future. This will especially ring true with the time for change model favoring the Republicans + the aftershock of the Biden admin.
I think the Democratic party have zero clue on the Mexican/Hispanic culture here in Texas. Tons of them are more socially conservative than the left wants to admit.",,"Georgia lifelong resident of suburbs, georgia will turn red. The young men of this state are done with the left & being lied to and their trusted abused by biden and Democrats. A lot of them 
 were convinced to vote blue otherwise we were fascist racist nazis. The regret is very, very real.
Especially considering Georgia is now the 8th strongest economy in country by GDP, if biden's 3.5 TRILLION dollar tax hike goes through, the left will be excoriated here. We are doing fabulously well economically and Bidens proposal of tribute and extortion would directly strip our state of valuable resources.

Presidential Election,[The Pacific Renaissance] 2035 Philippine presidential election results,https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/q38oj0/the_pacific_renaissance_2035_philippine/,"The wait is finally over! While the new poll is ongoing, I‚Äôm going to post the results of the 2035 Philippine presidential election that the previous poll had come to an end a few days ago. After that, a possible poll or a follow-up to this one will be posted in about 3-4 days. For now, enjoy reading this lore below!
The 2035 presidential election in the Philippines was held on May 14, 2035 to determine the successor of outgoing President Sherwin Gatchalian. It was won by Vice President Bato Dela Rosa, but the election was marred with controversies surrounding the canvassing of results due to the election rigging where some provinces are expected to vote for Sotto, but instead they voted for Dela Rosa, despite that Dela Rosa had faced corruption charges last year. The observers have criticized the COMELEC as they argued that the Sotto supporters have been rallying around while Dela Rosa's camp have convinced the Filipinos to cut loose ends between him and Sotto during the final days of the electoral campaign. Despite being the winner of the election, Dela Rosa would only be recognized by the Sinosphere, who had 'secretly' endorsed him to be the next President, while the FSEA and the United Nations would recognize Sotto as the President, thus leading to a crisis between the two after Dela Rosa's presidency had begun on June 30, 2035, the day before the accession of the Philippines to the Federation of Southeast Asia. Since Dela Rosa is the winner, he is the ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô President of the Philippines despite he was criticized by the Filipinos, especially netizens.
BACKGROUND
The 2035 Philippine presidential election is more heated due to controversies and surprises as different parties have filed their candidacies for both president and vice president. Before the ASEAN Alliance for Filipinos would name their nominees, other parties would already submit their nominees before them. The first party to file was the People's Champ Movement as they would nominate Manny Pacquiao once again for President, but this time, he picked Mariano 'Mimo' Osme√±a of PROMDI as his running mate. The next party to file is the Republican Movement as Jonvic Remulla would once again be announcing his intention to run for President, but he picked a different running mate in Senator of Quezon Province David Suarez. The Alliance for Change would be the next party to name their candidates as former House Speaker and incumbent Senator of Marinduque Lord Allan Jay Velasco would be their party's presidential bearer with Minority Floor Leader Edgar Labella of Cebu City as his running mate. After failing to be nominated in presidential candidate Jose Sto. Ni√±o Bernos's ticket during the 2034 ASEAN Alliance for Filipinos presidential primary, former DAR Secretary and former member of Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (now Social Democratic Party of the Philippines) John Castriciones will be running for President under his new party, Future Philippines Movement, and picking former Governor of Bohol and now Senator of Bohol Arthur Yap as his running mate.
The 2034 ASEAN Alliance for Filipinos presidential primary had ended up in controversy with both Vice President Bato Dela Rosa and Mayor of Quezon City Gian Carlo Sotto have filed their candidacies together even after the convention had been concluded, thus creating a dispute between both sides, which lasted for five days when the alliance had picked Sotto to be the alliance's presidential candidate and Isko Moreno's running mate Edcel Greco Lagman Jr. to be the alliance's vice presidential candidate, thus creating a unified ticket between Sotto and Moreno. Former Senator Francis Pangilinan would not endorse Dela Rosa's ticket and eventually, the alliance had removed the membership of Dela Rosa and his allies while Hugpong ng Pagbabago had suffered a split when Senator of Maguindanao Dong Mangudadatu had announced to leave Hugpong ng Pagbabago and form the Unity for Change with several of HNP members as they don't want to part with Dela Rosa and his faction. Eventually, Vice President Dela Rosa would file his own presidential bid under the Hugpong ng Pagbabago with some support from the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Revival Party and pick former PNP Chief Guillermo Eleazar as his running mate.
ISSUES
The main issues for the 2035 Philippine presidential election are the following:
(1) the situation on the police system, especially it was very controversial due to VP Dela Rosa's corruption case, which the Philippines have experienced the rise of crime ratings since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic
(2) the preparation of the Philippines' accession to the Federation of Southeast Asia
(3) the humanitarian efforts in Myanmar (due to civil war) and Cambodia (due to a crisis between authoritarian government and democratic opposition)
(4) the rise of autonomous and independence movements in some regions due to the results of the 2034 referendum where pro-China parties are trying to block any move in preparing to join FSEA","CANDIDATES

CAMPAIGN
The election campaign would start on February 7, 2035 with six presidential candidates have kicked off their presidential campaigns in different places: Quezon City (Sotto), Tagum (Dela Rosa), Tagbiliran (Castriciones), General Santos (Pacquiao), Cebu City (Velasco) and Makati (Remulla). While Sotto, Castriciones and Pacquiao have been campaigning for the better change of the Filipinos when the Philippines will join FSEA, Velasco and Remulla have campaigned for their own issues such as they wanted to conduct another referendum on the membership in FSEA as they believe that the Philippines' accession to FSEA would change everything and they also want to get themselves influenced within the Sinosphere. Meanwhile, Dela Rosa said that had been neutral to the current issues, but he promised to the Filipinos that he will fix the police system that brought controversies all over the country during the early 2030s with crime rating had been higher in the last two years.
In the first debate in Cagayan de Oro, the six candidates have argued with each other about the first issue, which is the concern surrounding the peace and security of the Filipinos where these have been marred by crime ratings as well as political violence that killed officials in the past two years. Pacquiao clarified that the Filipinos must defend themselves if they want to make the Philippines stable and to protect themselves from chaotic events. It was reflected from the recent shootout between civilians and PNP officers in Kidapawan, North Cotabato that killed 20 people and injured 40. The second debate took place in Bacolod where they would argue about the preparation of the Philippines' accession to the Federation of Southeast Asia. While Sotto, Castriciones and Pacquiao were in favor of the accession, Velasco and Remulla would against it. However, when the panel of hosts asked Dela Rosa if he's in favor of FSEA or not, which Dela Rosa said that he was against it because he believes that there's no significant change for the Filipinos, especially that the crime ratings have been hampering the police system. He also argued that the Congress must review it before they'll be planning to make a referendum. Of course, Dela Rosa is a retired PNP Chief and then, former Senator-turned-Vice President, which he had his own vision of trying to protect people from crime, which it didn't turn out to be good. One thing that it was something controversial is that his statement during the second debate started to make questions on his recent corruption case and this causes Dela Rosa's chances of being the next President had been at stake.
Finally, the third debate would take place in New Clark City where the six candidates would argue with each other about the marginalized people if they want to enforce them through different ways. All candidates have managed to state their plans with the marginalized people, especially for Sotto, who was seeking a fund for the marginalized people from the poor places in the country. He stated that the places that have been lack of food would be given donations as he wanted to make them living through the fullest. Dela Rosa would also have his own ambition with the marginalized people is that he can build scholarship programs to the poor people in order to have fine education for themselves. There's also a coincidence that the education in the Philippines have been stable in the recent years after the dropout era from the year 2022 to 2026 in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Dela Rosa would promise to the Filipinos that he will make better change for the marginalized people to grow themselves with hopes and dreams.
Then, comes to the final days before the election day where the miting d'avance took place in various cities. One of the most important miting d'avance in the 2035 elections was in Sotto's camp where they hold a rally in Pasig where he, alongside running mate Edcel Greco Lagman Jr., outgoing Mayor of Manila Isko Moreno Domagoso and Deputy Speaker Andy Lacson, had voiced his supporters to support the future of the Filipinos when the Philippines will be now part of FSEA while stating that they want to visualize for a better change through the Amihan Pilipinas 2040 platform. He promises to them that they will be ready to follow the virtues of the Filipinos to make the Philippines as one of the countries that have been resurgent after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.",,"I think the Presidential Electoral Tribunal would vote in favor of Sotto by the margin of around 11,400 votes. Maybe the 2038 midterms would be a referendum on Dela Rosa's leadership if you ask.","Yeah, I like that idea. I can use that for my new poll that I will be posting right now.

Presidential Election,Poll: Fewer than half of West Virginians believe legitimacy of 2020 presidential election - WV MetroNews,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/pj97js/poll_fewer_than_half_of_west_virginians_believe/,I'm not sure I believe in the legitimacy of West Virginia.,"1861, Virginia has a convention on whether to secede from the Union
the election of convention delegates drew 145,700 voters who elected, by county, 152 representatives. Thirty of these delegates were secessionists, thirty were unionists, and ninety-two were moderates who were not clearly identified with either of the first two groups. Nevertheless, advocates of immediate secession were clearly outnumbered.
Thereafter, the secession convention 
Virginia's ordinance of secession 
 held on May 23, 1861, by a vote of 132,201 to 37,451.
Later that year, ""West Virginians"" are deciding to secede from Virginia
On June 13, Carlile introduced to the convention ""A Declaration of the People of Virginia."" The document declared that under the Virginia Declaration of Rights, any substantial change in the form of state government had to be approved by a referendum. 
 all of its acts--including the Ordinance of Secession--were illegal and void. It also declared the existing government in Richmond void and called for the reorganization of the state government on the grounds that Virginia's secession had effectively vacated all state offices. On June 19, delegates approved this plan unanimously.
The next day, June 20, the convention selected new officers of the Virginia state government (usually called the Restored Government of Virginia to avoid confusion with the secessionist government). Francis Pierpont of Marion County was elected governor. On June 25, the convention adjourned until August 6.
So since the ""West Virginians'"" claim that Virginia didn't vote to secede by referendum was false, the Restored Government of Virginia was formed on illegitimate grounds and has no legal claim to be the true government of Virginia. It was this rump government that ratified ""West Virginia""'s secession from Virginia.
In 
 the Supreme Court implied that the Restored Government of Virginia was the actual state of Virginia.
As there seems to be no question, then, that the State of West Virginia, from the time she first proposed, in the constitution under which she became a state, to receive these  counties, has ever since adhered to, and continued her assent to that proposition, three questions remain to be considered.
Did the State of Virginia ever give a consent to this proposition which became obligatory on her?
...
The first step in this matter was taken by the organic convention of the State of Virginia, which in 1861 reorganized that state and formed for it what was known as the [Restored Government of Virginia]-- an organization which was recognized by the President and by Congress as the State of Virginia, and which passed the four statutes set forth as exhibits in the bill of complainant.
The US government does not have the power to de-recognize a state government and recognize another group as that state. Unfortunately, this is all the Supreme Court said on the issue, but it seems entirely lacking justification for such a bold claim.
Even if secession from the Union is illegal, Virginia's government did not change after secession--in fact, the Virginia government continued exactly as it was while joining the Confederacy. It had the same governor, state congress, state judiciary, and etc. before and after secession. So since secession was illegal, Virginia still existed and had never left the union, so the Reformed Government could not fill state offices that weren't vacant.
Furthermore, the Constitution guarantees a republican government to every state. A rump government voted in by 2 counties in West Virginia cannot be said to have the mandate of Virginia‚Äôs actual population, so it is not a constitutional government at all even if it was created legitimately and legally.
In fact, claiming that ""West Virginia"" exists makes you a neo-Confederate, because that implies that Virginia legally seceded from the Union, therefore vacating all its seats from government, allowing the Restored Government to replace them!
Therefore, ""West Virginia"" is unconstitutional and does not exist.",,West Virginia & Delaware were invented so that Manchin & Biden could become senators,

Stefanik is able to narrowly beat Harris by winning back Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. Democrats take control of the house and senate in 2024 after the Supreme Court strikes down roe v wade, enraging many democrats. Much of Stefaniks agenda has to be watered down and passed with the support of Joe Manchin, Kyrsten Sinema, and other conservative democrats. In the 2028 primaries, Stefanik easily wins renomination. The democratic primaries feature candidates such as Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman, Georgia governor Stacy Abrams, and former Transportation secretary Pete Buttigeg. Ossoff narrowly wins after a strong debate performance and goes on to win the democratic nomination. Ossoff, under immense pressure to choose a woman of color as his running mate, chooses Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto as his running mate.

So is the Nationalist Party wanting to reunite with Canada or the UK?","Thanks for the appreciation! I spent a lot of time getting all the candidates just right.
As for the China issue, that's where the metaphor starts to break down-- my explanation is that the US essentially lost the Cold War, leading the Soviet Bloc to expand across much of the world while the US lacks much of its former influence (ie, pro-democracy protests in Europe rather than HK). In that case, you could say that the Nationalists want warmer relations with the USSR, perhaps joining a USSR-led puppet organization like COMECON.","The 2020 United States presidential election was held November 3, 2020 to elect the president of the United States for a four-year term, with 538 electoral votes at stake. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasingly belligerent actions taken by the USSR, incumbent president Madeleine Albright and vice-president Ralph Northam of the Democratic Progressive Party won re-election by a sizable margin, handily defeating Nationalist Party candidate Larry Elder and third-party candidate Joe Lieberman.
President Madeleine Albright's first four-year term had seen her approval rating fall sharply due to her controversial policies such as legalization of same-sex marriage and reforms to Social Security. Although her Democratic Progressive Party had taken major losses in the 2018 midterms, most notably Larry Elder's election as governor of the DPP stronghold of California, her government's adept handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, lauded as among the best responses of any government in the world, gave her campaign momentum as the 2020 election approached. She selected Ralph Northam, a political rival who had challenged her in the DPP primary, as her running mate.
Albright's opponent from the opposition Nationalist Party, which had governed the United States as a one-party state during the ""White Terror"" period of martial law, was California Governor Larry Elder, who selected Senator Steve Daines as his running mate. The party had previously considered nominating Apple CEO Tim Cook, who had claimed that the Virgin Mary had appeared to him in a dream and called upon him to run for president. Elder's campaign was described as ""right-wing populist,"" aggressively criticizing the Albright government as corrupt, elitist, and ineffectual, leading Albright to criticize Elder in turn for being unduly negative and lacking serious policy proposals. As the campaign continued and the issue of pro-democracy protests in Europe became prominent, Elder came under fire for his supposedly weak stance in defending American sovereignty from the USSR.
On Election Day, President Albright won in a landslide against Elder, receiving 57% of the vote to Elder's 39%, with third-party perennial candidate Joe Lieberman receiving a meager 4%. In concurrent congressional elections, the Democratic Progressive Party maintained its majorities in both houses.","*In late 2020, following his defeat in the presidential race, Governor Elder was removed from office due to a successful recall vote, replaced by the DPP's Gavin Newsom.",
Presidential Election,2024 U.S. presidential election prediction for Arizona: D + 0.7%,https://www.reddit.com/r/YAPms/comments/q1gzds/2024_us_presidential_election_prediction_for/,"I think it will be a 0.1-0.3 R win because 75% of the reason why Dems won Arizona in 2020 is because Trump bashed McCain repeatedly, and especially if Biden‚Äôs approval rating doesn‚Äôt improve significantly it‚Äôll narrowly slip away.","Yeah it‚Äôs possible, but Trump is likely going to run 
 and it could cost the Republicans Arizona. The state is still absolutely fiercely competitive but it‚Äôs absolutely blueshifting.",,"I think it could be upwards of 0.5% if Republicans run a good campaign gearing Arizona (not bashing McCain and being not as bombastic). I will continue to advocate for the fact that Arizona in 2020 with 2012 Romney demographics would be R+7. Running a good suburban Republican would generally save Arizona easily.
In a 2024 circumstance where it's Trump V. Kamala, I see independents and disaffected Republicans biting the bullet and it could be R+5. Someone like DeSantis, who would generally be better at appealing to standard conservatives and independents (like Romney did), I could see it being +1 v.s. Biden and +6 v.s. Harris.
Job Approval for Biden is down 17 points (Civiqs) in Arizona (note, JOB APPROVAL, not favoribility), which is worse than Trump near the end of 2020, and it's down low with independents as well.
TLDR; R+0.5 is my margin baseline for 2024 AZ, it could be a bit better is Republicans run a good AZ campaign, Trump v. Kamala is likely 2016 margins to R+5, RDS v. Biden is likely R+1-2 at this point, and +6 v. Harris. His job approval is bad with independents and in AZ right now, even though he's probably about the ceiling for Arizona Democrats at the moment.

Presidential Election,1952 United States Presidential Election - Bonn Timeline,https://www.reddit.com/r/twrmod/comments/pjcyqg/1952_united_states_presidential_election_bonn/,"The 1952 United States presidential election was the 42nd quadrennial presidential election. It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 1952. Republican Douglas MacArthur won a landslide victory over Democrat Adlai Stevenson, ending a string of Democratic Party wins that stretched back to 1932.
Stevenson emerged victorious in the Democratic National Convention, defeating Estes Kefauver and Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia. The Republican nomination was a close race between Douglas MacArthur, a general very popular for his leadership and strategy during The Pacific War, conservative isolationist Senator Robert A. Taft, former Governor of New York and Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey and liberal Senator Earl Warren. MacArthur was able to narrowly prevail over Taft at the 1952 Republican National Convention with Richard Nixon, a young California Senator, as his running mate. The first televised presidential campaign saw MacArthur take a dominant stance of anti-nazism and pro ‚ÄúAmerican dream‚Äù, with Stevenson seeming weak and meekly in comparison.
The MacArthur campaign attacked a perceived weakness of Stevenson not taking a strong enough stance on Nazism and containment, whereas Stevenson focused on the popularity of the New Deal and stoked fears of nuclear war with Germany under MacArthur, who the Stevenson campaign accused of insanity. MacArthur was able to raise his poll numbers through his campaign slogan ‚ÄúI Back Mac!‚Äù, which was turned into a campaign chant known around the nation.
The death of Adolf Hitler during the final months of the election helped further anti-nazi sentiment among the American public, and the dropping popularity of sitting president Harry S. Truman was seen as a tipping point in the campaign. MacArthur‚Äôs anti-nazi sentiment and the party exhaustion of the American public against the Democrats saw a republican victory, with MacArthur winning 55.2% of the popular vote, and carrying every state outside of the south, as well as Virginia, Florida, and Texas, states that had almost always voted for Democrats since the end of Reconstruction.","This is a series I'm going to be doing based off of the Bonn timeline of TWR, a nazi victory scenario.

Presidential Election,2024 US presidential election prediction for GA: D + 2.3%,https://www.reddit.com/r/YAPms/comments/q0mvee/2024_us_presidential_election_prediction_for_ga_d/,"completely possible. I'm gonna repeat a point I've said before as to why this may not even be possible, but likely.
Let's look at Georgia and Texas. In 2016, Georgia went to Trump by 5.1%. In 2020, it went to Biden by .25%. This was a 5.4% shift to the left.
In 2020, Texas went to Trump by 5.5%, these are almost identical numbers between the final margin of Texas and shift of Georgia. Now, let's look at 2016. In early 2017, nobody thought Georgia would be blue in 2020. People knew the trends were there, however, nobody thought that in only 4 years could we see such a shift like that. Now, it's early 2021, and nobody thinks Texas will go blue in 2024, but we know the shifts are happening. See what I'm getting at? These scenarios are extremely similar.
To continue, look at 2012 to 2016. The entire Rust Belt was likely blue minus Ohio. Everybody knew the Rust Belt was shifting red, but did anybody expect Iowa to shift 14%? Or Michigan 11%? That happened in 4 years.
My point is, we know Georgia is continuing to shift blue and its sprinting to the Democrats. There's no evidence to suggest otherwise; so it is very likely in my opinion Georgia could be a lean blue state in 2024, going off what I've previously seen. In fact, what's stopping 
 from being a 2024 map? (I can't decide on NC or FL so whatever) I hope I could get my point across.","Every one of the big 3 rust belt states that gave trump the win in 2016 went blue in 2020, what‚Äôs stopping the same thing from happening in Georgia and Arizona in 2024?",,I am using Wikipedia margins,It‚Äôs way too early to predict the very close states since we don‚Äôt know who the candidates are & whether Biden‚Äôs approval ratings will recover.

Donnell, as a quasi-libertarian Republican, refused to implement a nationwide lockdown or mask mandate, as he sees them as an unfair violation of Americans' personal freedom. He also quoted Benjamin Franklin: ""People who would give away Liberty for a bit temporary Safety deserve neither Liberty nor Safety"". However, he encouraged his supporters to be responsible, and Donnell himself always wore a mask when outside, washed his hands and physically distanced. The Republicans focused on the Southwest by pointing out how the Obama Administration did more deportations and Joe Biden's record on the Crime Bill and his friendships with segregationists.
This made the United States be very hardly hit by COVID, just like in real life. There were hundreds of thousands of deaths, specially in states such as Florida. The negative effects of Donnell's pre-pandemic economic policies also somewhat hurt his popularity.
Meanwhile, the Democrats nominated former Vice President Joe Biden, who faced a tougher primary battle than OTL. Given this, he picked Tammy Baldwin to be his running mate as an olive branch to progressives. Biden promised free preschool and community college, two-tier universal healthcare without an individual mandate, returning to the old taxation system, repealing the Balanced Budget Amendment implemented by Donnell, a nationwide lockdown and mask mandate, and refunding Planned Parenthood.
The Republican National Convention was done in a mixed online and in person format, while the Democratic one was fully online.
Donnell's rallies were physically distanced and masked and sometimes online, while Joe Biden mostly avoided physical campaign events.
During the first debate, Donnell's strong defense of his Administration's actions was noted by the media, while Biden seemed passive and failed to effectively defend the caging and deportations under Obama.
The second debate was respectful, but inconclusive.
In election night, Donnell lost his home state of Virginia by 1,003 votes. However, due to the Republican Sun Belt strategy, he was able to win Georgia and Arizona by 2,647 and 3,186 votes respectively.
The Republican Party mostly accepted the results.

Presidential Election,American Nations #109: 2037 Michanian presidential election,https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/q01yay/american_nations_109_2037_michanian_presidential/,"A 
 was held in Michania on 7 November 2037. Independent candidate Josh Kaul won the Presidency in the first round with the backing of the Democratic Party and the Workers' Party, defeating conservative candidates Aric Nesbitt of the People's National Party and Tom Leonard of the Christian Families Coalition. Turnout was a record low 41.9%, with a precipitous 22% decline in turnout compared to the 2032 election.
--Background--
-2032 election-
In the 2032 presidential election, Democrat Garlin Gilchrist and Republican Brian Calley faced off in the runoff election on December 2nd after a hotly-contested first round where Calley beat Patriotic Party candidate John E. James by just 0.26% to qualify for the second round.
After a hotly contested second round campaign, Gilchrist won an extremely narrow victory with 50.62% of the vote to Calley's 49.21%.  Following a hand recount, Gilchrist was declared the victor, marking the first time that an Afro-Michanian would hold the Presidency.
Though the President's powers are largely reserve ones, Gilchrist played an active role in the administration of Premier Mandela Barnes, especially in the realm of foreign policy, where he became seen as a core actor in the Barnes cabinet's trade negotiations with the Midwestern Union.
-Republican Party split-
The opposition Republican Party, meanwhile, faced growing internal conflict. A moderate, Christian-democratic faction organized as the Christian Families Coalition arose in January 2036 to challenge the leadership of Tyler August, who had brought the party into closer cooperation with the right-wing populist Patriotic Party led by controversial political John E. James. At the party's nominating convention for local elections in September 2036, the internal crisis came to a head when the delegates opposed to August's leadership walked out following the nomination of his allies for a number of mayoral elections. Claiming that August had abused party rules that allowed him to influence the candidates who would be presented for a nomination vote, the CFC delegates held their own convention, nominating a slate of moderates for these seats instead.
On 26 September, the Court of Appeals for Southern Michigan ruled that as neither grouping had managed to assemble the necessary 3/4 quorum of delegates to hold a convention, the Republican Party had not nominated any candidates for the local elections. As such, Michania's second-largest party was in danger of losing its electoral registration and public funding. On 1 October, the majority group of the reassembled Convention voted no confidence in August, stating that he had forced the crisis in the party by failing to reconcile with the Christian Families Coalition.
However, August controversially claimed that since the convention did not have a quorum to nominate candidates it could not strip him of his leadership position. The Court of Appeals agreed with this position and stated that August remained at the head of the party. This angered much of the remaining convention, save a handful of August loyalists, who by this point were more inclined to blame August than the CFC for the party schism. Thus, on 10 October 2036, the party convention split once more, with 5/6 of the remaining delegates walking out and establishing a new grouping to be called the People's National Party.
The remaining group loyal to August soon found that they had essentially no support base. As Politico described the situation, ""August found himself with no friends and an infinite supply of enemies. The center-right CFC, by now a party in its own right, hated him for moving the GOP closer to the Patriots, while the new People's National Party blamed him for causing the schism in the first place.""
In the meantime, the GOP parliamentary group had split among the newly-established factions. Of 44 members, 24 allied with the People's Nationals, while 17 joined the CFC and August and two others remained loyal to the old Republican Party.
--Nominations--
Under Michanian electoral law, parties are not required to hold primary elections, Instead, they may opt to turn over the election of candidates to their party conventions.
Though all major parties had held primaries in the 2032 presidential election, the governing Democratic-Workers' Party coalition agreed to cancel their respective primaries in 2035 with the intent to field a joint candidate with the aim of avoiding a runoff election. The Green Party, which has not run a candidate for President since 2027, was also given a small number of delegates. At the joint nominating convention of the three parties on 16 September 2036, a number of candidates were discussed. Since President Gilchrist was constitutionally ineligible for a second consecutive term, presidential hopefuls included Secretary of Health and Human Services Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat who recieved the backing of the party organization on account of her broad support among the party's middle-class base, Workers' Party chairman Abraham Aiyash, and Chair of the Assembly Governance Reform Committee Jocelyn Benson. However, since no candidate could attract a majority even after days of negotiation, parties agreed to find a compromise candidate. Eventually, this candidate turned out to be progressive independent Josh Kaul, who was nominated by all three parties on 29 September with 1,992 votes in favor and 1,025 against.
Thanks to the agreement of cancellation of primaries on the left, talk within the Republican Party began regarding potentially  cancelling the primary and nominating a joint candidate with the Patriotic Party or Wisconsin Bloc through a joint convention similar to the Democrats. This item was scheduled to be discussed at the 2036 party convention which resulted in the schism in the party.
Following the split in the Republican Party, in October 2036 the People's National Party's founding convention nominated former Speaker of the General Assembly and Secretary of Foreign Affairs Aric Nasbitt as the party's presidential candidate by a vote of 2,552 - 821. Soon after, Patriotic Party leader John E. James announced that in light of the progressive coalition's joint nomination and the split in the GOP, he would support Nasbitt in the interests of defeating the left and ensuring that a ""true conservative"" moved to the second round. Tyler August, leader of the remainder of the Republican Party, announced that he would support Nasbitt as well, and would not run for President, citing a lack of funds in the rump party's organization to support such an endeavor.
The Christian Families Coalition, meanwhile opted to hold a primary election supported by the Election Commission. Election day was set at 19 February 2037, the earliest possible date under Michanian law. While the CFC was the only major party to hold a primary, Party Chairman Tom Leonard was the only significant candidate to file, facing three minor candidates including leader of the anti-abortion group Life Movement Jacob Gannett. In the primary election, Leonard won 80.6% of the vote, trouncing all other opposition. Gannett came second with 9.3%.
The Wisconsin Bloc, meanwhile, broke its long-held tradition of not backing any candidate in the first round and endorsed Leonard, citing his promise of more devolution for Wisconsin and his statements on the issue of federalism, which he had not opposed in the 2029 referendum, unlike almost all other Michigan politicians.
--Campaign--
The official campaign period began on 20 June, following the last possible day for primary elections (no primaries were held on this date). However, in the wake of the bombing of the New York embassy by the Provisional Armed Forces of the United States, all three major candidates suspended their campaigns for three days.
The Presidential campaign was relatively low-key thanks to the relatively low profile of the office in Michanian politics. The President's limited powers made the presentation of a meaningful policy agenda difficult for any of the candidates. As such, the contest became more one of character than of substance.
Kaul, with the endorsement of outgoing President Gilchrist, campaigned as the candidate of stability, promising to keep a low profile in office and work with all parties to form a government after the next legislative election, despite his affiliation with the left. He also promised to appoint the Premier from the largest party in the General Assembly, even if it were from the Workers' Party, a controversial issue thanks to the WP's high polling numbers at the time making this a real possibility in the next Assembly election.
Nesbitt, as the nominee of the PNP, promised that he would take a more active role as President, saying that people were ""tired of unelected Premiers running the country with no check on their power. That's what the Presidency is supposed to be for, and I'm promising to put it to use"". This included refusing to appoint a WP Premier and promising to veto any bill that more than 65% of Michanians opposed.
Tom Leonard, meanwhile, made regional issues the core of his campaign. He promised to work with the Government to coordinate a process to devolve more power to the Michigan regions, create an autonomous government in the Upper Peninsula and devolve more tax varying power to Wisconsin.","--Debates--
Two televised debates were held during the campaign. All three main candidates were invited to participate in the first debate, but Leonard was controversially excluded from the final debate on October 30th thanks to his polling numbers falling below 10%.
At the first debate, the main issue at hand was the temperament of the candidates. Kaul attacked Leonard as not well-suited for the impartial moderating role of the President and described him as insensitive based on a photo taken of him at the memorial for the New York embassy bombing victims joking with another attendee. Meanwhile, Nesbitt criticized Kaul for his connections to the Workers' Party. A snap poll taken after the event suggested that Kaul had won the debate, with 40% of respondents saying he was the best candidate at the debate.
The second debate controversially excluded Leonard, as he had fallen below 10% in the polls. While Leonard attempted to sue the Debates Commission to restore his presence, this was summarily dismissed on October 20th, and the debate went ahead with just Kaul and Nesbitt present. The main issue at this debate was foreign relations, one of the few areas where the President has substantial authority. Nesbitt promoted free trade with the Atlantic Economic Union and full freedom of movement between Michania and Canada. Kaul, meanwhile, opposed free trade on the basis of its harm to jobs.
--Polling--
Thanks to the presence of two conservative candidates and no significant progressive opposition to Kaul. he led with wide margins throughout the campaign, polling at around 45%, with his two opponents polling at about 20% each.
However, in early September, a photo of Leonard was released from the official memorial for the New York Embassy bombing that appeared to show him laughing and joking with another attendee. This was widely criticised as insensitive given the tragedy of the event the memorial commemorated, and hurt Leonard's image among his base, which caused him to drop from 19% to just 9.5% in a week in poll aggregations, with most of the remainder going to Nesbitt.
In the final polls taken in the days before the election, the expectation was that Kaul and Nesbitt would advance to a runoff with approximately 45 and 28 percent of the vote respectively.
--Results--
On election night, turnout was much lower than expected. Many observers attributed this to the relatively low-key campaign, as well as many conservative voters staying home thanks to the lack of a strong conservative party organization and divisions on the right. Overall, just over 7 million voters cast a ballot, 41.92% of the eligible voting population. This was a precipitous 22.3% decline from the 2032 election.
In a shocking upset, Kaul took home 53.2% of the vote thanks to low turnout among conservative voters, winning the election in the first round and obviating the need for a runoff with an absolute majority. Nesbitt also beat his polls with 30.1% of the vote, while Leonard's 11.2% polling average collapsed to just 9,3% in the final tally.
Because Kaul won a majority, the second round, scheduled for 2 December. was not held.
--Aftermath--
In the wake of the split in the conservative vote and the resulting progressive victory in the first round, there were calls to reunify the three conservative parties. However, this was ultimately unsuccessful and no agreement was reached.
Kaul was sworn in as President on 1 January 2038 in the General Assembly chamber by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.","Christian families would win Monroe county Michigan, other than that this is good","This is a serious nitpick, and as such shouldn't be taken seriously, but for countries other than the United States Wikipedia just assigns an arbitrary color to independents.

 but my own flavor with revamping TL:
The 2020 Federated Provinces presidential election is held on Monday, October 20, 2020. The Social Democratic ticket of former mayor of New Amsterdam and politician named Ellen Lindeboom and the mayor of Miraikirusuto, Tetsuro Fukuyama had defeated the former MP Ben Sasse and incumbent Staatsminister Mikael Oscarsson after slump polls. The election took place against the backdrop of the NCOV epidemic that is already collapsed and eradicated and continuing Space Resource Burst. It was the biggest gain since 2010 while the Liberal Democrats faced its worst performance following declining polls and second in terms of top votes based on voter turnout with each of candidates receiving more votes but most of them go to National, Greens, and Vr√øhedsfront, surpassing the previous election records in the past years.
In the following previous months, the Liberal Democrats had suffered worst performance amid corruption scandal at the tail end of Romney's administration accompanied by economic crisis brought by Space Resource Burst, West German short economic problems, and foreign policy blunders including the failed Qing China-Amerikaaner Summit. While the Social Democrats under Lindeboom has risen to take her chances of capturing the presidency with fulfillment amid challenging growth of National, Green, and right-wing Vr√øhedsfront or Freedom Front. National has led by Paburo Tomoyuki with his running mate Julian Castro has performed well in the polls but soon finds out outmatched by the Social Democrats, the Greens faces steep problems tough as Lindeboom's magical campaign which have prevented them from possibly gaining their share of votes and the Freedom Front is campaigning well in rural and conservative counties whereas she appealed to Amerikaaner/ethnically white working and elite class disillusioned with the two dominant political parties that were already reigning in the federal politics since the 20th century as well as disillusionment with the decadent culture.
The election saw number of votes that are now already with two political parties poised to overtake the Big Three (Social Democratic, Liberal Democratic, and National) but failed to gain due to sheer size of popularity and growth of young voters already registered into voting but the Social Democrats has gained their notoriety in terms of number of votes, which led to negotations in forming the current coalition.","i am confused

House Green Caucus Leader (2079-2081)
Norton was seen as part of the reason Pat Jenkins nearly reached the second round in 2076, but he was unable to replicate that success when he was nominated for Vice President.
The Green Party is supported by former Democrats who dislike new changes in the party, as well as college students and many other first time voters. However, like Bernie Sanders of the past, the internet presence of its supporters do not show the true results of the election.
For President: Phil Miles
Governor of Kansas (2071-2079)
The Unity Party‚Äôs first governor west of the Mississippi, Miles was controversial as governor. Despite this, he was able to get nominated by the party due to an aggressive campaign.
For Vice President: Joe Montgomery
Mayor of New York City (2070-2078)
The Unity Party‚Äôs main anti-UNPA politician, many thought that Montgomery was mainly chosen to try to attract more voters. However, debate blunders only pushed said voters away.
The Unity Party was formed by moderate Democrats and Republicans who disliked the way their parties were changing. It is the party members of other parties can get together and make fun of, because many of their candidates are incredibly boring people.
Should the United Nations‚Äô proposals for more global cooperation be supported?
Democratic Party: No, the US is already having a job shortage, and the UN‚Äôs Global Free Trade Agreement will take more jobs to foreign countries
Libertarian Party: No, the US should have control over its territory, and allowing other countries to make laws for it is a bad idea
Republican Party: Yes, the US has plenty of resources, and these proposed ideas will help the US use these resources to help poorer nations
Green Party: Yes, the Parliamentary Assembly and Global Free Trade Agreement will benefit everybody, and allow for developing nations to prosper
Unity Party: Mostly yes, but until the UN can show that Parliamentary Assembly elections will be free and fair worldwide, it should not be supported
What is the best course of action for space colonization?
Democratic Party: The government should fund space colonization, as it will create jobs and alleviate the housing crisis
Libertarian Party: The US should subsidize SpaceX and other private space companies to create jobs in the space industry
Republican Party: The government should fund space colonization, because in the future, space will be the best source of iron and water
Green Party: The government should focus more on improving earth, rather than going to space
Unity Party: The US should make sure the UN supports space colonization before beginning, but it is a good idea","Libertarians being viable, and somehow winning.

I inform you, there will be plenty of allohistorical allusions.

After a 
, Trump seemed to have achieved the impossible: returning triumphantly to the White House. Unfortunately for Donald, fate's sick sense of irony was waiting for him. Just after assuming office, the nation was shaken by the catastrophic Great Wall Street Crash of 2025. The world was hit by a financial and economic meltdown not seen since the Great Depression [1]. Over the miserable next few years, Trump proved unable to combat the crisis, as his protectionist and populist measures failed spectacularly. He watched helplessly while the Republican Party that he had controlled so tightly in the past found itself plunged into a civil war between his supporters and a growing number of disaffected Republicans, many of whom backed a libertarian and laissez-faire approach towards handling the depression [2].
As 2028 dawned, the United States remained in deep economic ruin. To the horror of the GOP establishment, the outsider and relative political novice Justin Amash swept through the primaries leading the libertarian insurgency that had affected the party since the Crash of '25 [3]. He promised a swift end to the depression with drastic pro-free-market ideas and economic non-interventionism. When he won the Republican nomination for president at the 2028 RNC, a small group of Trump Republicans bolted and instead formed their own convention, choosing Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz as the candidates of the newly formed ""National Republican Party"" [4]. More interestingly, the Libertarian Party also nominated Amash as their candidate, but instead of accepting Ron Paul as Amash's running mate, they chose Gary Johnson as their vice-presidential candidate. As a result, a weird semi-electoral fusion ticket was born [5].
In the end, Justin Amash couldn't beat the Democratic Party, and Jeff Markley was inaugurated as the 48th president shortly after [6]. The Trump Republican ticket only obtained a humiliating 1.2 percent of the popular vote.
1- Just like the Panic of 1893.
2- The free silver movement gets replaced by economic libertarianism.
3- Justin Amash is like William Jennings Bryan, a radical outsider that shakes the party to its very core.
4- This mirrors John Palmer and the rest of the enraged Gold and Bourbon Democrats who formed the National Democratic Party to oppose Bryan's candidacy.
5- Like the Populist Party, the Libertarians choose a weird and unusual strategy towards the presidential election.
6- Unfortunately for him, Amash's crusade suffers the same fate as Bryan's. However, Bryan ended up running for president as the Democratic nominee on three different occasions, who knows what the future holds for Amash?",How were the 2026 midterms?

Presidential Election,A Spaceman In The White House - 1992 United States Presidential Election,https://www.reddit.com/r/imaginaryelections/comments/pxhdbt/a_spaceman_in_the_white_house_1992_united_states/,"The 1992 United States Presidential Election saw incumbent President John Glenn defeat challengers Republican Senator Bob Dole and Independent businessman Ross Perot. Glenn‚Äôs high personal approval rating, the general unpopularity of Dole, and several foreign policy victories of Glenn‚Äôs administration is credited as the main reasons he was reelected.
Glenn‚Äôs first term was fairly successful and eventful, with several shortfalls. By increasing the corporate tax rate, cutting military spending and cutting government waste, the deficit was temporarily reduced through 1988-1990. However, Glenn expanded spending on research and development, along with increases in the NASA budget and beginning planning for a manned Mars landing, which kept the deficit as large as before his presidency, leading to some inflation. He also reintroduced several environmental regulations that were stripped under Reagan. However on the foreign policy front, Glenn had several more successes. He oversaw the end of the Cold War and the Soviet Union, reaching out to several former Soviet republics and Boris Yeltsin. He began negotiating a North American Free Trade Agreement, with focuses on wage and worker protections due to his upbringing as an Ohioian. He also oversaw the Gulf War, leading a coalition force to successfully drive Iraq out of Kuwait but pushing no further, to the grumbling of many of his more hawkish advisors but the pleasure of his Secretary of Defence, Colin Powell. He also negotiated two multilateral denuclearization deals; one between NATO and the People‚Äôs Republic of China (1989) and another between the United States and the new Russian Federation (1991).
There was no major challenge to Glenn in the Democratic primary. It was speculated that, due to a lack of healthcare reform which was promised in 1988, Kennedy considered challenging Glenn. This never ended up occurring, as Glenn promised that he would begin reforms in his second term. However, the Republican primary was a competitive field, including Senator Bob Dole, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan, and house representative Jack Kemp. Dole‚Äôs name recognition and extensive experience gave him the boost needed to beat his more conservative challengers.
The wildcard of the race was Ross Perot. A Texas businessman and political independent, he ran on getting the deficit under control, social liberal values such as abortion and gun control, and populist values such as opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement that was under negotiation by Glenn. He chose fellow businessman and celebrity Donald Trump as his running mate, due to Trump‚Äôs name recognition and his 1988 abandonment of the Republican Party.
Glenn ran on successful multilateral deproliferation treaties, technological and economic developments, several successful manned NASA missions and Operation Desert Storm. Senator Bob Dole attacked a stagnating economy and growing deficit, and ran on his strongly moderate record.
The race was seemingly neck and neck, but several last minute events, like a strong debate performance and announcement that NASA is planning a manned mission to Mars in 1996, John Glenn won the presidency. This election saw the best third party performance in the popular vote since Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. Glenn won just one state less than the previous election.",Also one small criticism is that John Glenn was actually a friend of the Kennedy family so the Kennedys would have supported him,,GLENN!,YEAH!

So by likely you mean unlikely? That's a weird definition of likely. You definition is of likely includes unlikely, but not 
 unlikely.",,,"Many of the states that go to the Democratic nominee will by then (i) have laws postdating 2020 giving Republican politicians, not non-partisans, control over certification, and (ii) have people in those roles willing to subvert democracy by just pretending their states' results are fraudulent. Trump will have worked hard to install such people, but even if someone else is their nominee (contra Maher's predictions) they'd have the same motives. As a result, these states will send false electors as well as or instead of real ones.
First, this case is somewhat dependent on HOW many states you're talking about. If one state needs to throw out results, that's more plausible than having to throw out 3-7 states. Second, this has still never been done, even though several states could have tried this in 2020. From all the reporting we have, most politicians know the claim is a lie, and have to publicly go along with it just to appease voters. There are obviously SERIOUS repercussions if states have a total, and openly throw it away to elect who they want.
The implementation of these laws is also subject to legal challenge. If the state legislatures just seek to overthrow results because they don't like them (i.e. don't actually provide proof to throw out election results), citizens of the state can sue arguing that violates citizens rights under the state and/or federal Constitution.
If previous midterm swings are to be trusted, the 2022 midterms will give Republicans enough control over Congress that their all refusing to certify a Democrat's victory on January 6 2025 (in 2021, already most Republicans wouldn't vote for such a certification, and they as a party often vote unanimously on issues) could well lead to a one-vote-per-state tie-breaker. In 2021, this mechanism would if triggered have seen Trump win, since there were 26 states where the vote would have been Republican; in 2025, this number need not be any smaller.
To get there, both the House and Senate need to reject the certification. For the 2020 election, less than 10 senators voted to do that, and less than 140 House members voted to do that. And tensions were HIGH at that point. Unless they can come out with something more convincing, I find it unlikely they can get 218 House members and 51 Senators to overturn the certified election results."

Actually, I think Zemmour may be a more challenging second round candidate for Macron than Le Pen.
He benefits from being brand new in the political field, while the National Rally is experiencing some level of disillusionment among its voters.
He may be more likely to convert LR voters in the second round, just for not having the stigma of being named Le Pen.
He is a much better debater than she is, which means he wouldn't liquefy himself in the final debate.

While the 2016 election results can be useful in mapping out where to get the votes for 2022, there are a lot of unknown variables in play this time.

I want to wait until the next round of surveys in December, by that time, all Presidential candidates will be known already, esp the substituted ones.  We will soon find out if the opposition will rally behind Leni and let the remaining 4 other candidates split the DDS/BBM votes.  Of course, this is the best-case scenario for Leni since Isko has already declared (through his Campaign Manager) that he is not with the opposition.
I think the battleground will be NCR since Duterte-Marcos won it in 2016, but it's also the hardest hit by Duterte's mismanagement of the pandemic.  R3, R4, R5, will most likely vote for Leni.  Although Leni largely won Visayas (except Leyte), it was mainly because of Mar. Since Mar is not running and has not officially declared support for any candidate, this may be a toss-up.  But Senator Drilon can also deliver the Visayas vote for Leni, I saw him in pictures joining the preliminary meetings with Leni's team.
I guess Leni's team has their work cut out for them. They should know, by this time, where and who to target with their messaging and campaign sorties.","Drilon and Roxas would fight tooth and nail to keep Western & Central Visayas for Leni, with Bato maybe challenging that. R5 will lean Leni. R4 outside of Mega Manila will lean Leni as well. R3 and Mega Manila is a toss-up, with Isko's presence and Leni's declaration challenging BBM. R2 might surprise us with a switch to pink after two effective responses to flash floods.
Mindanao will be a battle of Bato and Pacquiao, hurting BBM's stronghold in SOCCSKSARGEN, but I see a number of provinces will lean Leni."

The Republican ticket of U.S. senator from South Dakota Hayden Henderson and former California governor Sidney Hubbard defeated the National ticket of U.S. senator from New Mexico Mathias Moore and U.S. representative Josh Hawken of Missouri. Henderson became the youngest president ever elected, with his age at his inauguration being 39, beating out Theodore Roosevelt who became president at 42 after William McKinley was assassinated. Henderson also became only the third U.S president to be a sitting U.S. senator when elected, after Warren Harding and James Kennedy.
Henderson narrowly won the Republican primary, beating out former Governor Edward Newman of New Mexico and Representative Alex Bowmann of New Jersey. Moore also faced stiff opposition in the primary, with fellow senator Louis Saunders of South Carolina and former senator Thomas Walsh of Idaho vying for the nomination.
In the general election, Moore slightly outperformed his polls, winning very narrow victories in New Hampshire, North Carolina, and his home state of New Mexico. The real upset of the night however, was the strong showing of Libertarian Party candidate Gareth Johnston, with Johnston coming in a narrow third place in a number of Republican-leaning states, even coming in second in Idaho. With a vote count numbering in the millions, Johnston won the largest percentage of the popular vote for a third party since 1968, when Jude Gardner of the American Independent party won 14.2 percent of the popular vote. Henderson narrowly won a majority in the electoral college, and a plurality of the popular vote. On the 10th of November  (also the same day that Moore conceded), Henderson delivered his victory speech in front of a crowd 50,000 strong in his home city of Sioux Falls, an impressive feat considering that Sioux Falls has only 390,000 people. Henderson took office on February 11,  2017, with the oath being administered by Chief Justice Spencer Garrison. The Inauguration of Henderson drew an incredible crowd, even reaching upwards of 2.4 million, surpassing president Jocelyn Bridges inaugural crowd of 1.9 million.","first serious post here, hope you like it :)","i will also be posting the two party platforms sometime today

El Paso County, where Colorado Springs is with 1,000 square miles became the largest county by population in the state when the 2020 census data was released a couple months ago, just overtaking Denver County (the city and county are coterminous) with its 100 sq habitable miles. I suppose Denver County still cast more votes since it's rather progressive and politically engaged. But next election cycle that will likely change resulting in an embarrassing map for the Centennial State.
El Paso covers most of the Springs' metro area and has lots of plains to sprawl on, whereas the Denver metro is cut up among five (or six if you include Boulder) different counties so growth gets spread among them. Due to geography and infrastructure, none of them are likely to ever catch up to El Paso, which is where nearly all of the Springs area's growth occurs.
Besides geography facts, I guess my point is that due to county distribution and land area, this map may produce funky results."

Pepe the frog,Pepe the Frog: A Symbol of Hate or Something Different?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/pt8paj/pepe_the_frog_a_symbol_of_hate_or_something/,"Based on your wording and profile, I can tell your being serious about this. As someone who spends a ton of time on the internet, I can assure you the Pepe frog is not in any way a hate symbol. I think the reason you think this is because some groups use this icon to promote their hateful propaganda, but the symbol itself is just an internet meme that has been around for years. It hasn‚Äôt evolved at all, at its core its just a funny drawing of a frog, always has been.
I think at large your ‚Äúfailing‚Äù to understand that its just a large part of internet culture, being used in memes and mostly as reaction photos, especially in the case of its use across Twitch. I hope this helps. Let me know if I can explain further.","So, to give you an actually considered answer to your question: the thing to note about Pepe is that (regardless of what the people in this thread are saying) the image 
 become associated with anti-semitism, racism and the alt right‚Ä¶ 
.
Obviously, given the comments here, not everyone feels that way, and the context of the emote‚Äôs use is relevant to consider when trying to determine if it is being used in a racist way. But you will generally find yourself caught between two groups of people: people who 
 consider Pepe to be a hate symbol and react negatively to the idea that anyone would, and people who 
 consider Pepe to be a hate symbol and react negatively to its use in general.
The primary reason that you get pushback on this issue, is that, ostensibly, the images adoption by the alt right was ‚Äúironic‚Äù. The story goes that 4chan cultivated the idea that Pepe was a hate symbol to ‚Äútroll‚Äù people into taking it seriously and therefore it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù hate symbol.  This argument obviously ignores the fact that whatever the origin of this association, 
 bigots and racists have adopted the use of the character in 
, (not to mention that 4chan is, itself, a hotbed of racist and anti-Semitic ‚Äúhumour‚Äù) and the the ‚Äúit‚Äôs ironic bruh‚Äù line is an obfuscatory defence. Ironic racism isn‚Äôt tangibly different from sincere racism in effect.
To the point:
The 
 and 
 both note the use of Pepe among their documentation of widely used hate symbols, and the creator of the Pepe character has publicly killed Pepe off and distanced himself from its use in response to its adoption by the MAGA set.
I generally find that use of the Pepe emote demonstrates either ignorance of or insensitivity to the issues of racism relating to the emote at best, which isn‚Äôt great for fostering an inclusive community, or intentional and willful use of the emote regardless of the issues of racism associated with it (‚Äúfuck your feelings‚Äù) which is obviously 
.
For my part, I operate my stream and discord as a Pepe free zone, not because I think people using it are doing so in a malicious way, but because I am aware that some people find it‚Äôs use unsettling or uncomfortable, particularly people who are sensitive to issues of anti-semitism or racism, and my goal is to create a broadly welcoming and inclusive community. Being edgy isn‚Äôt the energy I want to cultivate. It‚Äôs an incredibly minor sacrifice (if you can even call it that, racism aside, Pepe is 
) to create a space that doesn‚Äôt immediately put marginalized members on the defensive.",Excellent answer.,"Excellent answer. The only thing I would add is that the creator of Pepe the Frog has said that he does have plans to bring Pepe back at some point, but in the meantime he is suing (and so far winning against) alt-right groups for using his intellectual property in such an offensive way. I never cared for Pepe myself, but I'm glad to see the artist fighting back and winning.","Thank you, 
 and 
 for taking time to give a comprehensive response; I really appreciate it. I'm getting a clearer picture that many instances of the Pepe icon are posted without an intentional association with the alt-right agenda, which makes me feel a little better.
The source of my confusion is that I once listened to 
 Obviously, a lot can change on the internet in five years, so I just wanted to understand where people were at with the symbol's use today.
Thank you for helping me with this."

Blizzard Lawsuit,What's going on with Activision Blizzard lawsuit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/op8005/whats_going_on_with_activision_blizzard_lawsuit/,"Friendly reminder that all 
 comments must:
be unbiased,
attempt to answer the question, and
start with ""answer:"" (or ""question:"" if you have an on-topic follow up question to ask)
Please review Rule 4 and this post before making a top level comment:","Answer: The state of California is alleging that Blizzard/Activision has discriminatory practices and has rampant sexual harrassment problens within the company. These include ""Cube Crawls"" which is an apparently well known practice at Blizzard where indiviudals get drunk on the job and go from cubicle to cubicle harrassing employees (sexually for female employees as well). It included a ""relationship"" with a male supervisor and a female employee where the female committed suicide. The story has them on a business trip where the boss had a butt plug and lube packed and at the event co-workers were sharing pictures of the female workers vagina. The investigation leading up to now lasted 2 years. At the beginning of this investigation there was an all womens blizzard panel at one of the cons where theu discussed ""females at blizzard"". There was also the creative director that was named in the allegations that recently left the company under the official statement being related to being mad at the writing staff. The allegations also suggest upper management passing up females for promotions due to likelihood of getting pregnant, and less pay for female workers doing the same tasks. They also alleged that male workers would sit and play video games and give the work to the females.
Opinion biased: These are civil cases right now which will result in a fine. The amount of which I believe is TBD. It would have to be very large for it to make a dent.","I don't know where else to place this in the thread, because I don't know that I can do a good job summarizing what's going on without imparting bias, so I'm gonna respond to you. The lawsuit itself 
If you can stomach legal documents, it's worth a read. There's a lot of damning stuff that isn't being covered by Twitter, including a lot of potentially easily provably false allegations should ActiBlizz decide to fight the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, or the DFEH, on this. That speaks, to me, of the certainty of the material the DFEH has, and the degree to which the company has flouted the law.
Something that wasn't touched on anywhere is that it wasn't just sexism, it was various other forms of bigotry as well. The suit alleges that black women were treated remarkably worse than anyone else, including an allegation that one woman was made to write a document justifying how she'd spend her time off to her supervisor when none of her coworkers had to, which is just flat-out insane.
Another thing in particular that caught me about the whole thing was the public statement they made in reponse to the lawsuit, which 
 My read of their statement is that they're not necessarily denying that they did the things being alleged by the state, but that they've been trying really hard to change since things started coming to light. They issue a weak denial of the accusations, and proclaim disgust over bringing up the suicide, but outside the specific callout, they don't seem to be willing to commit to calling anything being alleged outright untrue. They simply stand by it being inaccurate, whatever that means to them.
One of their claims is that the state rushed to bring a lawsuit forward in spite of their efforts. However, the lawsuit itself specifies that July 21, 2021, the day it was filed, was the day that the company and the DFEH agreed upon as being the final day they had to bring forward a suit if one was to be filed. So if the lawsuit was truly rushed, it was by minutes, and not by months. The whole thing just reeks of corporate doublespeak, to me.
I don't think this is going to be a slap on the wrist, I think this is going to be an ass-pounding for ActiBlizz. The relief being asked for (that is, the punishment they wish to be handed to the company) 
 but it includes potentially 
 of money, depending on the severity of backpay owed and the provable inequality of pay given to female employees, on top of California in general being likely to make an example out of them for how egregious their conduct is.
It's possible this is a nothingburger, but the sheer magnitude of claims included by the DFEH that could be proven false in the lawsuit is staggering, more than enough on its own to bury a company. I don't think the state would bring this lawsuit if even half of what they're alleging weren't provably true.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Anyone gonna boycott the Crash Bandicoot series after the Activision Blizzard lawsuit/controversies?,https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/pt29l6/anyone_gonna_boycott_the_crash_bandicoot_series/,"If you would like to learn more about the lawsuits and the Employees organizing for change, please visit: 
They also have a subreddit: ",Not buying new Crash stuff has been pretty easy for about a year now,that's a pretty good burn from a user with a dingodile flair,"No. I know the kneejerk is to not play or buy the games, and while I used to feel similarly, the developers I follow (the people making these games, and ergo the people affected by the abuse) have intimated that they are not asking people to stop playing or enjoying the games.
They continue to work hard every day, many of them with teams they love, on games they love. The company is 10,000 employees strong; faulty leadership and abusers are the minority (albeit an oppressive and sometimes powerful one) and should be ousted so the other employees can better both the company and the industry overall.
Celebrating the work of those employees, and using said work to push for meaningful change will accomplish a hell of a lot more than me preventing ABK from earning the small percentage of the $59.99 they actually get after costs.
The size of boycott that would need to occur to affect any such change would be absurdly large, and frankly just will not happen.
Therefore, I prefer to still enjoy the developers' years of hard work, both from those treating it as a job, and those who love their teams and their games. The hard work of people who spent years to 
 that game to me, and fans like me.
I will be worth more to those people playing the game and supporting them through promoting their demands and their cause than I ever would be sitting on my hands just so I can feel good about not giving the company money.

Taking responsibility and apologizing for your role in this is paramount, Mike, and I really appreciate it.
When things got really bad in bnet - many of us felt abandoned by you, and what's worse, when I was threatened with physical harm and panic cc'd you about it -
I was later reprimanded for doing that, completely ignoring how terrified I was that my trying to save someone's life had somehow put my job in jeopardy, and that I was going to be assaulted at a work event because of it.
It felt like I was never given any grace, despite so -
many men in leadership being repeatedly excused for their behavior, and often being made to feel that the sexual harassment was totally normal and ""not that bad"", and even a compliment because of how normalized it was in bnet and wow.
When I think back specifically to how many women Afrasiabi harassed and assaulted, myself included, and how many people were traumatized by Bridenbecker, the toxic environment that Pearce's EA's had for so many years... it's hard for me to think that you couldn't have enabled it.
She posted some additional remarks: 
Before I go to bed, I want to say that Mike and I spoke about many of the things that happened to me. I appreciate his taking responsibility and being empathetic to what I endured, and to what I witnessed and heard.
I honestly believe that he was kept in the dark about plenty.
And
I hope that the leadership that is in place now, and his former colleagues, can take that as an example of how to handle this, and do better.
Thanks drysart and the others for pointing that out!
Edit, another follow up where she provides more thoughts in Mike's role and potential involvement: 
As hard as this is, and knowing I'll never work in games again:
Mike was directly responsible for the chain reaction of events that got me nearly fired for cc'ing him about Tia Zimmerman threatening me with violence for contacting emergency dispatch when she threatened suicide.
for me, and as a result, the compromise was to label me as a low performer and cut my bonus and my pay.
Don't tell me you wanted us to come to you. I came to you. And you destroyed my self worth.

Blizzard Lawsuit,Activision-Blizzard lawsuits in chaos as federal agency accuses California's DFEH of ethics violations,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/q6jw26/activisionblizzard_lawsuits_in_chaos_as_federal/,"Honestly I think this would be a bigger deal if they had left EEOC and turned around started representing acti-blizz, but simply going to a state agency is far less of a conflict and imo shouldn't preclude the entire agency from working the case. At least my understanding of the article is that the attorneys in question weren't even the genesis of the state investigation, and given that (at least in my experience) one of the first things that a state or federal agency will ask for is everything that was produced for the other agency it's not like info they gathered at the federal level wouldn't have been found at the state level. The point of the conflict rules is to prevent a lawyer from  using their prior access of a client to the detriment of that client. Here the settlement that is being objected to is 
 so I don't follow how the lawyers prior access would give them an unfair insight about the decision.
That being said I won't claim to be an expert on CA ethics rules so while I may disagree with the policy decision to hold DFEH to this standard I don't know how the case will turn out.","but simply going to a state agency is far less of a conflict and imo shouldn't preclude the entire agency from working the case
That's not the conflict.  The conflict is that these attorneys are representing DFEH 
 EEOC, their former employer, in a matter relating to the work they did for their prior employer.  That's a pretty classic conflict.",Agreed. Lawyer learns information working for client 1 on case against defendant 1. Defendant 1 settles publicly. Lawyer uses same info for client 2 against defendant 1. I don't see a conflict here.,,"Yeah, EEOC's position here is a bit of a reach.
Also, their actual motion calls into question whether this was an ethical violation at all. They have redacted all the critical information‚Äîincluding what role these attorneys held within EEOC‚Äîfrom the motion that would be needed to evaluate that contention, which both attorneys deny.
DFEH Attorneys 1 and 2 are former [REDACTED] with the EEOC.
Ms. Wipper responded later that day, contending that ‚Äú[n]either [DFEH Attorneys 1 or 2] participated personally and substantially as an EEOC employee in the [Activision] investigation,‚Äù requesting that ‚ÄúEEOC agree not to oppose DFEH‚Äôs motion to intervene,‚Äù and stating that she ‚Äúlook[ed] forward to the meet and confer conference‚Äù scheduled for the next day.
I can see why this would be a challenge for the former EEOC attorneys/DFEH attorneys. They aren't prohibited from participating in the DFEH Activision matter, which is a separate matter from the EEOC Activision matter. But assuming EEOC's facts back up its claims, they would be prohibited from participating in the EEOC/Activision matter as counsel for DFEH in objecting to the consent agreement. EEOC is reaching too far, though. Even if DFEH had separate, outside counsel at the time of the intervention, that separate, outside counsel would still be entitled to ask about DFEH's own investigation into Activision.
Overall, my impression is that EEOC is sandbagging DFEH, but these DFEH attorneys made a mistake."

Audi A3 Price,Audi TDI vs Jetta TDI help me choose,https://www.reddit.com/r/Audi/comments/mygsx0/audi_tdi_vs_jetta_tdi_help_me_choose/,"Speaking from having all three VWs:
Interior-wise, I‚Äôd stay away from mk6 Jetta‚Äôs (2011-2018 I think). They are the bargain bin cheap, especially the door panels. Hard plastic everywhere. Rattles, tail light problems constantly. There was a slight refresh or two, but at that point I think they stopped making TDIs. They also never got HIDs, stuck with halogens. And I don‚Äôt think keyless but I had a 2011.
Golf 6 TDIs are a step up, however the interior only came in one option in US, and the windowpanes are thinner to me. They also were optioned very sparingly with HIDs, but came manual and DSG. Any one with HIDs is like a unicorn. Even more so the manual. They also could be optioned with Dynaudio, range topping sound system, recommended. Also got Keyless. The manual trans is fun to row the gears, but is almost impossible to start from 2nd gear, constantly stalled for me. Remember reading there was a rpm cutoff and it‚Äôd just stall. DSG for TDI is the best option for city driving, it‚Äôs decently quick 0-50 around town.
Passat is a nicer interior, but I had issues with the emissions fix software wise. The car never felt as quick and hit a wall when accelerating, compared to the Jetta/Golf having the same fix. The only negative on them were slightly reduce MPG (~2mpg). Got rid of the Passat quick.
The Audi looks to have the nicest interior,  but only DSG AFAIK. Also saw ones with S line packages. Never owned one, so dunno mechanically. I‚Äôd get the Golf or A3 personally.","Depending on the model year, the Passat came with what‚Äôs commonly referred to as the gen. 2 TDI engine the Jetta came with the gen. 1 TDI engine which, at least in my experience has slightly fewer issues.
One of the most annoying things that tends to happen with the Passat is plugging of the heater core, which from a technician stand point is a bit of a pain to repair. I‚Äôve also seen charge air coolers leak coolant internally which causes ‚Äúphantom‚Äù coolant loss. Fuel injectors can also fail, which can cause anything from rough running/lack of power to a noise during cold start that sounds like a rod knock.
The Jettas and Golfs with the gen 1 engine tend to have particulate filter and NOx catalyst issues especially after the software update as part of the dieselgate fix. Turbocharger failure is not extremely common, but does happen, as does failure of the turbo waste gate solenoid which can mimic the symptoms of a failed turbo.
As far as comparing the two models, the Passat has much nicer interior that‚Äôs made of much higher quality materials. The Jetta uses lots of plastic and feels just a little cheap and I‚Äôm not a fan of the ergonomics of the seats or the interior as much as the Passat.
A good bet is finding one with a CPO warranty of better yet, one that‚Äôs still covered under the TDI warranty extension, which can be made to cover almost anything powertrain, or even drivetrain related of the dealer is cool and slick enough with their wording to VW.
Hope this helps some.",Yeah that was very informatively. Thank you. Does the Audi A3 have that same engine?,,

the a4 and 330i is just such a considerable step down in sportiness from an m340i, 340i, and s3 that it‚Äôs hard for me to suggest if you want those cars. of course a b9 s4 maybe could be snagged as well.","I have a very similar list of cars I'm looking at but at a little higher budget (S5, 440i, C43, Stinger, G70, CT4-V).

All of these things are only true to the Audi A3 and Q3 and the rest of the Audi lineup of vehicles are more unique.

Audi A3 Price,Looking to replace my old beat up 2010 Volkswagen Jetta with either a 2017 Subaru Impreza 2.0i Sport or a 2015 Audi A5 Premium Plus. Asking for advice regarding financial responsibility.,https://www.reddit.com/r/subaru/comments/mo1eoc/looking_to_replace_my_old_beat_up_2010_volkswagen/,Both the cars seem pretty similar. What you need to do is find out how much each is going to cost you to insure it. That's going to be your biggest difference between them.,"Maintenance will be a lot different too. I've never owned an Audi, but I know people who do, and the maintenance costs are apparently ridiculous. Subaru is much better in that sense. Plus, between the two you're looking at, the Subaru is newer and lower miles? Seems like a no-brainer to me.","With the Audi, the maintenance and repair costs are going to eat you alive as a college student. They're nice cars, but once out of warranty and starting to age at 6 years old... and financing it at that age.... bad financial decisions.
The Impreza is the more rational choice with better resale value in a few years, that won't eat you alive on maintenance costs. Seems a bit high on the price. I mean, hell, my dad picked up a base Forester brand new in the $24k range in 2018. The Impreza is 3-4 years old now and is only ~$3k less.
If it's me and in college like I once was, I'd look cheaper and look to not finance it if at all possible. You're doing absolutely great otherwise financially making $25k/year at that age and not taking out student loans. But that also doesn't mean to take out a loan on a depreciating asset.
Think of it this way, even the Jetta isn't going to cost you $20k in repairs even over the long run, but buying and financing a new car at $20k+ maintenance. You might think you're saving money by buying a newer car, but you won't be. But I also get you that the Jetta is probably a pain in the ass at this point.
I'd look a bit older in the 2013-2016 range for Imprezas. Maybe more mileage, but don't be scared of it - Subaru tend to take mileage better than VWs.",,

If you are asking a question please make sure to include any relevant info along with the following:
Redditors that have been verified will have a green background and an icon in their flair.","Did it resolve the original issue? From your post it seems like it did. With that said - a turbo like this is going to make a loud whistle/whine sound when the bearing starts to fail. It will need to be replaced.
It seems like they charged you 140 for the turbo - but didn‚Äôt actually replace it? Is that right? Shady mechanics sometimes anchor a lower price by ‚Äúdiscounting‚Äù a higher one - he made you a deal by lowering the price!
Did you see the air filter before he changed it? This is a really common tactic to pad the bill.
He itemized a seized nut? Did he show it to you?
IMO 50 for the hose and 40 for the gasket is too much. Make sure the hose is actually new.
Did you ask for the additive? What was it?
It seems like you got taken for a ride a little bit with the info you shared. At the least it seems like they didn‚Äôt actually fix the issue and you‚Äôll be back soon for the turbo replacement - which means another hose and gasket also!
I had a mechanic do this to me when I was 19 and didn‚Äôt know any better. Make sure it just happens once.
Before they repair anything - google it! Check the price of the parts. Watch the YouTube video of how it‚Äôs fixed. Call around to other mechanics and ask what they charge. Familiarize yourself with whatever needs to be done before they do it. Just being involved will save you money and headaches.
Also - put your initials and the date on your air filter. That way you will know 100% it‚Äôs actually yours. Google what a dirty filter actually looks like. They all seem dirty.
Good luck","Spot on here. Doesn‚Äôt sound like it was too bad but you were definitely overcharged for the hose and gasket. Also a lot of padding the bill going on. The air filter is a classic and I fully second 
 ‚Äòs suggestion of marking yours somehow. It‚Äôs not an uncommon practice for shady mechanics to keep an especially dirty filter laying around so that they can show you how dirty ‚Äúyour‚Äù filter is and that it needs changed right away (friend of mine had this happen to her and fortunately she knew enough to know that it wasn‚Äôt even the right shape to be her filter).
A seized nut would be another easy ‚Äúscam‚Äù way to pad the bill. I‚Äôm sure a shady mechanic could do that all day and never have anyone ask to see the seized bolt they had to pull off",,"I‚Äôm actually going to disagree with the other people on this post. Idk about labor rates where you‚Äôre from but they don‚Äôt seem unreasonable.
Onto the parts 50 for the hose, at first glance this seems kinda high right, but if you‚Äôre mechanic was tying to do a good job and used an oe hose this really isn‚Äôt that bad. Idk about where you are but here in the states oe hoses for things like audis and bmws run well over $60 depending on what they are for.
The 100 for the full service I can‚Äôt comment on because I‚Äôm not sure what was done there, and if it included labor.
Now onto the 40 for the gasket fuel purge and others. I‚Äôm going to assume from what you said that this includes, an exhaust manifold gasket an intake manifold gasket and a couple of turbo gaskets, which again for bmws and audis here in the states can run well over $10 each.
Now where I‚Äôm concerned is why the mechanic didn‚Äôt replace the hose then test to see if the whistle was still there before pulling it apart and getting it tested. Could be the mileage was right for it to go but if I knew there was a leak in a hose that could make the sound I‚Äôm hearing I would definitely replace that first.
TLDR when you break it down it doesn‚Äôt seem too bad, but my question is why didn‚Äôt they replace the hose before sending the turbo off to get tested?"

Regarding which car...well...that is really a personal preference.  They all have their known issues, so some good research will alleviate ""fault"" concerns.  Gold R's tend to hold their value better from what I've seen if that is a consideration.  The RS sounds the best IMHO.  The S3 looks the best.

For a country with such high tax and comparatively decent population with such advancement in tech across all sectors it's pathetic.,"I had to google it but apparently stealing steering wheels and airbags out of luxury cars is a thing now (seems it started in the UK?). Here's some advice I found:
If you are worried about this recent spate of crime involving air bag theft our advice is to utilise an old style steering lock which passes across the centre of the steering wheel or covers it completely. You could also consider marking the rear of the wheel (somewhere where you don't touch it regularly) with a UV Pen and the Registration mark of the vehicle to which the unit belongs."""

the manual would be sweet but it wouldnt be practical in the winter. winter tires help a ton but once you start lowering a car you kind of lose the ability to go 
 snow. the 2 times i've been stuck in my stock height GTI were because i lacked ground clearance on my stock height GTI. and all those mods will make it a rather rough daily driver or winter driver. And it sounds like it has a performance clutch if it felt heavy to you because i find the stock clutch pretty light. its going to have stiff suspension, loud exhaust, lots of vibrations from the engine mounts, a heavy clutch","Yeah, I'm thinking the same.  I'd prefer the nogaro wheels with the leather interior, but I kind of doubt the dealer would swap the wheels on their two cars.
Just kills me to pass on the modded one when I'll probably end up doing an ECU/TCU tune and then something so that I can at least hear the engine and turbo on one of the DSGs.  I actually didn't mind the Billy Boat exhaust, it wasn't excessively loud unless you revved all the way up and there was no drone cruising at highway speed.

Generally if the residual is low and you can pay for it outright without financing it would be beneficial for you to atleast drive the car until powertrain warranty expires and subsequently hope that by then this whole shortage is over. If the residual is low but you'd have to finance it that's when things get a little tricky as used car finance rates are usually higher than new car lease/finance rates so in that case it might be worth it to take your dealers offer and get into a new car. Remember that used cars are valuable right now and to do some research on trade-in prices and maybe get another dealership to appraise the vehicle as well so you know the offer is fair. And finally if the residual is high then it's probably best to take the dealerships offer and just see what's the best deal they can offer.,Thank you this is very helpful advice!!,"Please review our most

If so, stick with the Polo. There is no point having anything nice, especially anything diesel.
There will likely be a ban there in the next 5 years, you barely move there anyway, and anything will get dented and battered.
If you live outside London, keep the Polo for a daily, and buy a Cayman S, or something like that.","I do live in London, yeah

Looks like there are some in your price range though maybe not near you.  Maybe one is worth the trip if you like the idea.  Might be the only AWD plug-in option for your needs.
Kia Niro is similar but just FWD and more fuel efficient when not on pure electric.  You can use fuel on the highways and focus the electric on the most stop and go and low speed parts of your commute for the best overall efficiency.

You could even consider the electric version.  Might have to go to a charger if you plan to make an extra stop during your commute though.
I guess mid-size sedan isn't what you're looking for so that would rule out the Kia Optima PHEV, and the Ford Fusion Energi/Plug-in Hybrid.
2019-2020 Hyundai Kona Electric Range on these would cover the commute and then some.  Looks like a few are in the price range

Audi A3 Price,Kia Seltos vs Used Audi A3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brunei/comments/lpy35a/kia_seltos_vs_used_audi_a3/,"Not really the same type of car. Seltos is a SUV while A3 is a sedan. I think you think about what you'll be using your vehicle for first and then find the vehicle that fits your needs, not just what fits your targeted budget. If you can find something cheaper that fits your needs the best, even better.","If its ur first and only car. I would recommend you to go home with a new car and worry free on its maintenance. In terms of parts wise its cheaper to sourced kia parts and labor
If you happen to owned a reliable and spare daily to go around with then you can get the used A3 incase one day that audi will encounter major repair so you will have a spare car to ride.
From my verdict. I will definetly go for seltos interms of size, 0 mileage, warranty covered and fresh components.","For your daily drive, always go for reliable cars because you probably only have this car for your daily commute. Generally, you should go for the new and the Japanese/Korean cars.
For your first drive, always go for the cheaper/value-for-money cars, because you do not want to be paying a lot of interest/'costs' on the loan and have this loan drag on for years. Generally, you should go for compact/saloon types and avoid the luxury/SUV types because car companies put higher margins on the latter two types. Additionally, you do not want to pay for the shipping costs from Europe to Brunei, when you only need to pay for shipping costs from S. E. Asia or E. Asia to Brunei. Finally, note that Brunei car tax is 15% for cars of < 1.7 litre engine size and 25% for the rest.
Considering repair costs and waiting time for parts, you should avoid anything non-Japanese. Prices and waiting times for European car parts are very long and I would say the same is true for American car parts. Korean car parts are only slightly better though. Furthermore, you have fewer mechanics here able to work on non-Japanese cars which means their boss will charge more. There are horror stories of car owners that were held hostage by non - Japanese car dealerships, metaphorically-speaking, because the cars take forever to fix and there's no money left to buy food afterwards, metaphorically-speaking.
No! God!... No! God! Please no! No! No! Nooo! #TheOfficeUS. Why the heck would you want to buy an Audi, and a lower class type A3 at that?!! Audis are not as good as BMWs or Mercs. They are owned by Volkswagon, and hence share some design and parts, particularly those of the lower classes of Audis. Volkswagon cars are only middling and they are known here for their non-manual and non-automatic (can't remember the name) transmission that fails after a few years and are super expensive to fix.
I know of a friend who once owned an A3 that gave this person quite a lot of frustration after a few years of ownership. This person eventually sold it and then went ahead and bought another exotic car and then another one. Some people never learn to avoid exotics, I guess, but that person never bought an Audi again! Considering the costs of the multiple repairs, particularly by local mechanics who don't understand the more complex parts, I guess that person did learnt something.",,

In short (comparing a CX-30 Turbo Premium Plus vs Turbo Carbon CX-5):
Definitely the CX-30 Turbo Premium Plus. The fact that you are even considering the two means the extra practicality of the CX-5 is not a necessity/priority. Next, CX-30 pros: .360¬∞ camera (makes parking dead easy, in every situation) .Heads up display showing you critical information like current speed, speed limit and cruise control information .LED DRLs instead of nasty halogens in the CX-5 .Matrix LED headlights (in US it will change the angle if the headlight based on steering input for better visibility on curves and turns, for Australians reading this, top spec Astina models get another Matrix LED cluster, that will automatically blank out parts of the high beam depending on traffic ahead of you, we unfortunately do not get the turning lights). You get heated mirrors, auto dimming mirrors and a heated steering wheel. Sure, the CX-30 has a torsion beam rear suspension so it won't be as comfortable as the CX-5, but due to it's lower weight and smaller wheelbase it's faster and uses less fuel than the CX-5. ‚Äã The only reason to go for the CX-5 is for the slightly more SUV-ness of the car (although if you really wanted to go off-road, you wouldn't be looking at a CX-5 anyway), the extra legroom for rear passengers, the extra boot space for carrying stuff. But that begs the question, what about a Mazda3 hatch/sedan? If a SUV is not needed, and space is not a priority, is there any reason to get the CX-30 over a normal Mazda3 Turbo Premium Plus? You're paying more just to sit a little higher."

If you could look at and afford a used RS3 that would be an upgrade, or maybe the higher larger sedans that Audi sells but that's getting into another price segment pretty quickly
. Also just a new GTI four-door, with the digital cockpit on the upper trim if you don't have that already would be an upgrade. The golf R is there too but I'm not sure that the new ones are over here in the US yet, but apparently the new one is basically perfect. Reviewers are blown away.
Either way with 37 K mileage, You must not have had that GTI long, So the fact that you're looking for something different but looking at something that's so similar I would be afraid that in another 30 40 50,000 mi You would say the same thing about the A3 because It's going to feel the same.

Where do you live (broadly, not asking for home address ;) ) as for example prices vary massively, specs vary, climate varies and so on.

Volvo XC60 exists with AWD and manual both in the previous generation (D4, 220ps) and the current (D4, 190ps). Goes to 100 in 8.1/8.8s and tops at 205.

Audi A3 Price,Was this a fairy tale lease?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/ogr121/was_this_a_fairy_tale_lease/,"My local dealer ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù price for A4 premium is $395/mo with $2500 down 12/36. So I think you got a decent deal, but also consider in 2019 their could have been better incentives on the A4 compared to today. Def contact your previous salesperson If You were happy with their service.
Edit: I finally had a chance to crunch the numbers using local pricing, and with $2500 off MSRP that is exactly a $325 a month lease. Looks like Audi has a handful of incentives on the A4 right now . It also looks like there‚Äôs a healthy inventory on the A4 so you can probably count on more bargaining power if they have a ‚Äúmarket adjustment‚Äù .
The best thing about using the same sales person is that it will save you a lot of time and energy - at a minimum you know you‚Äôre happy with the current situation and you didn‚Äôt get ripped off.

Audi A3 Price,Are all A3s slow?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Audi/comments/os7p7k/are_all_a3s_slow/,Newer cars are vastly superior in terms of quickness/speed/handling etc. I used to have a 2007 Volvo S60 inline 5 twin turbo AWD with numerous modifications. I‚Äôm fairly positive My newer Q3 with the 2.0T Quattro would beat my old Volvo  in a 1/4 mile race even tho the Volvo has way more performance parts and a bigger engine. If you drive a newer A3 they are really quick it‚Äôs probably just the fact that your comparing a 2011 to a 2019.,"I hear ya.  But the A3 felt especially doggy. I've had all kinds of cars and have pretty reasonable expectations when it comes to performance.
2011 is not 
 old to not have much pull from a turbo 4 cylinder.   My old 2006 3 series at least felt like you were going somewhere when you stepped on it.  The A3 was going nowhere with the accelerator on the floor.
Maybe I just drove a bad one??",,"The newer A3s are quick, quicker than some of the higher-numbered models.   There was a total  redesign for 2015.  My 2015 A3 2.0T is pretty quick and does 0-60 in about 5.5 seconds.  The top speed of the A3 is less than the higher-numbered badges though, limited at 130 mph I believe.
From a quick search it looks like if you have the 2.0 gas engine you have max 200 Hp @ 5100 rpm and and 207 lb- ft of torque @ 1800 rpm with a curb weight of 3300 lbs.
My 2015 only weighs 70 lbs more but has 220 hp @ 4500 rpm and 258 lb-ft of torque @ 1600 rpm, and also gets better fuel economy.
You just can‚Äôt compare a 2011 to a 2019.  The 2019 A3 is certainly faster than the 2019 Jetta.","I understand what you are saying. But regardless of age, HP is HP.  Power delivery may have improved 
 over 8 years but definitely not a ton.
Our Jetta has less than 150HP vs the A3s 200HP in a slightly heavier car.  I think at worst they would perform similarly.  But realistically the Audi should outperform the VW.
I've never once floored the VW and expected more.  The A3 on the other hand left a lot to be desired in terms of performance."

I've already seen the value of my current car plummet due to being a non ulez compliant diesel so selling and buying now would be losing at both ends.",What car do you want if you don't mind me asking? You don't think that car will hold its value a bit?,"The issue is supply, not demand for new cars.
I can only explain it like this, even though the new cars dont exist yet, there still is a market for them because people are ordering and waiting. So its still a supply and demand situation sort of.
But here is where it gets different, because people still need a car, whether its a stop gap, or just another used car from the market and all of a sudden it appears the demand has shifted to here, bingo the price goes up.
But in reality, only the used car actually exists, so the demand is really only existing here too in a sense, if you get what i mean although it actually isnt...
As for price, no i dont think we will get a return on our investment. Ultimately the used car will age, depreciate and become worth less over time. Unless of course its something special, but again its another situation.","Of course, we'll always lose on depreciation, just wondering if the loss will be larger because of the current inflated prices.

In my experience, the discounts comes in auxiliary things. Full tank of fuel, if it doesn't have a 12 month MOT see if they'll slap a new MOT on it, service before it's sold, etc.
You could go even more and start inspecting wiper blades and ask for that amount knocked off, have done that myself. Might get told to fuckoff trying to knock off ¬£25 from a ¬£16,000 car though.","I don't think discounts are very common at all unless you go for one of their finance deals which are generally terrible and will cost many times more than the discount in the long-run.
You're more likely to get (and should insist on) things like a good-length warranty, servicing/MOTs thrown in as a sweetener for paying full price. If they refuse go elsewhere."

You can write.",You're too kind!  But yes.  I mean - I read a lot but haven't written before.  Thanks for the comment.  Appreciate it.,"This was intriguing. And well written. I like the honesty.
You mentioned withdrawal, so I'm assuming your MC is using for maintenance rather than for the high. Codeine has a shorter shelf life when ingested in this way, so the impact only lasts about 3 hours instead of 4. This is because once it has been extracted it metabolizes very quickly. In pill form, it takes around 30-40 minutes to feel the codeine. If he's waiting for the jitters, though, he'd be using every 4 hours or so. He would need a baseline of 25-30 mg of codeine to prevent the jitters, especially because CWE is only about 75-80% effective at extraction. Since he can only get 8 mg pills, then he's going to need about 4 pills every 4 hours to maintain comfort. In other words, 24 pills would last him about a day. If he's taking pills at night. If not, he might be able to stretch it.
If he's a long-term user, don't forget to address the issue of constipation. It's something nobody talks about but it's something every codeine-addict knows intimately.
Anyway... just a little bit of info. Don't know whether it's useful or not.",Very helpful. Thanks. Appreciate it.,Really good. Depicts addiction quite well.

With 2 people going car camping, with a cooler and folding chairs and all the other stuff, the thing becomes absolutely packed to the gills with the rear seats folded flat. An Outback would provide some nice ground clearance for dirt roads (which are sometimes rutted) as well an extra couple feet of trunk space.
If you have 2 dogs and all that gear though, not to mention a kid planned, you are almost certainly going to need something bigger than that...likely something with 3 rows (the rearmost of which you can fold flat) or you'll need to look at putting a cargo box on the roof -- which is always an option on all of the above."

They've gone from 35.5k to 31.9k which is an 11% drop in price I imagine they are pretty much at rock bottom.
Ask yourself is saving another $300-$500 (MAYBE) worth possibly losing this car? If it is...keep trying if they are stonewalling you its not cause they want too but have too.","as other people have pointed out, how much cheaper would it have to go for you to jump on it right now.  $500? $1000, are you willing to risk (with high probability) not buying that car at all. are you trying to wait for it to hit $28k because thats not going to happen.  Your only negotiation space is in what they can add on to the vehicle (oil changes, service, warranty, etc...) and even then I think you are pushing your luck.",Or wait a year and get it for 28k when the 2017s come out,
Audi A3 Price,2018 Audi A3: Am I getting a good price?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askcarsales/comments/9fa9e3/2018_audi_a3_am_i_getting_a_good_price/,"I got my A3, which was the Summer of Audi Premium like the one you are looking at, for about $31,500 after taxes. I went through AFS and they paid for my first month's payment and everything and I also got a decent interest rate for it being the first car I bought so going through AFS is the way to go. So the deal definitely sounds good!
Located in Texas BTW.","Do you know how much your car was before tax? Also, what options did your car have? Your deal sounds even better",,I don't know what manufacturer rebates you're getting or what ones are contingent on financing thru AFS.  But if it's finance contingent then just follow up with the customer service team a few days after purchase and pay it off in full if you want. Or pay extra to principal... there aren't penalties for that and the rebates to you aren't contingent on it.,Yup it is contingent on using AFS. I'll probably put down ~30% and pay off within a year!

Audi A3 Price,Which is the best option amongst these?,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/dugree/which_is_the_best_option_amongst_these/,"Skip the Cherokee, the early ones had a few bugs, particularly with the transmissions.
The CLA is surprisingly not terrible to maintain considering what it is, but IMO it feels a bit cheap compared to other Mercedes models and the rear seat headroom is a joke. If you really like it though, more power to you.
Audi A3 is a decent enough car in 2.0T Quattro trim. If it‚Äôs a 1.8T FWD you may as well be driving a Jetta a gluing an Audi badge on it. Turbocharger failure is not uncommon, though also not inevitable if you do oil changes early.
BMW 328‚Äôs from 2012-2014 had issues with their timing chain guides wearing prematurely, requiring super expensive repairs if you don‚Äôt catch it in time and you‚Äôre out of warranty. Can be done preventatively but still not that cheap. 2015+ build dates are supposedly much better. If you get a well maintained ‚Äò15+ and find a good independent BMW mechanic it shouldn‚Äôt be too horrible to maintain. Dealer service and maintenance out of warranty is ludicrously expensive.","I'd honestly stay away from all of those if reliability and maintainance are a concern for you.
If you want a reliable used luxury car, it's hard to beet Acura and Lexus for their reliability.","Hmm thanks for your advice! By reliability I meant it should be safe to drive 200-300 miles journeys without breaking down. And by maintenance, a maintenance cost of under 1k (that's what I see on KBB, but I know it can be much more if soemthing goes wrong). should be okay with me. If I really wanted any of these brands which model do you think I should look for? I see a lot of 2013-2015 bmw 328is are they any good? Why are Audis so cheap too? Just wondering haha :)","I would say yes, bad idea. One of my bosses bought a 2015 Audi last winter and it quit less than a month later. Turbo went out $6k repair. Luckily he paid for the extended warranty (which also wasn‚Äôt cheap) so he wasn‚Äôt out that money. He‚Äôs constantly saying he wishes he still had his 2005 Altima that he traded in.",

I suspect the 1.8 with 170 HP and FWD isn't the best driver, but comparably equipped you can get a A3 2.0 Quattro (which I drove) for roughly the same price as a CLA.
I was shocked to find how much better the A3 was.  Everything about it was better. The backseat was much more use-able, Interior Materials were much higher, it drove a lot better too. Seemed quicker, much better grip, transmission seemed more refined and quicker, and you never noticed it was down a gear on the CLA.
I wasn't expecting it, but after the A3 the Mercedes just seemed cheap and of poor quality.
I suspect it will sell well, but will cannibalize A4 Sales.","I find it interesting that Audi is including the panoramic sunroof, xenon headlights and leather seats as standard.  I was waiting on the GTI, but I may go take a look at the A3 for shits and giggles.
Although, I went on the audiusa to configure and there were no options for manual transmission :(",,,

Part of this is irrational, but I like relatively unique things.

I just wanted to add that in addition to weak external rotation within the shoulder socket, the mid & low traps are oftentimes weak as well (especially if you spend a lot of time working at a desk/phone).
A good quality pull-up will work all of that (as well as the exercise 
 linked) It's why the cue for pinching your shoulder blades together at the top is so important.
When you see someone doing a pull-up and their shoulders are shrugged up, it means they're trying to do most of the pulling with their arms. However, another option to do a pull-up is to tap into your lats, which are much bigger muscles than your biceps. Think of your arms & shoulders as the connector between the pull-up bar and your lats. This means that you should make sure that your arms & shoulders are solidly secured to your lats so that the lats have a more stable anchor to pull on. If your shoulders are shrugged up, that means that your shoulders are pulled away from the rest of your torso including your lats, which of course means you're not as connected to your lats.
There is definitely an upfront investment in working on this form, but ultimately you have more potential this way.
This link is from the RR but here it is again, timestamped:
Other cues to play with: keep your shoulders down away from your ears as much as you can, keep your chest broad, pull your elbows behind you.

Ibanez Series S,[QUESTION] What are some mid range(budget-wise) really thin guitars with floyd rose? I'm talking Ibanez S series thin.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/hxrozu/question_what_are_some_mid_rangebudgetwise_really/,There‚Äôs really nothing else like an S-series. Very unique guitars. The Prestige models do have a binding.,"So the Ibanez s models are some of the thinnest guitars I‚Äôve seen. There are other thin guitars out there but nothing with quite the same shape except really niche stuff.
Also, I would avoid cheap guitars with a Floyd, they are just a nightmare to keep in tune and properly setup. There are a lot of corners cut on the guitar when a quarter of the cost is the floating trem.
There are S models with fixed bridges, but you could always get a cheap Ibanez with trem and then block the trem or install a tremol-no, that way if it sucks you can always turn it into a normal guitar anyway.
As for specific recommendations throughout the gamut:
 (would trem lock or tremol-no this one)
 (probably the highest end S model short of the made in Japan $2k range, has a trem lock system which makes tuning more stable and alleviates typical trem issues)
 not affordable but this guitar is amazing, I‚Äôve got a green version of this and got it used for 1.5k. Phenomenal stuff.
 not even a recommendation just some dream material right here.","You got me there with the first one. (And I liked the blue one better ahaha).

I just went on a deep dive into the history of the L5-S and it's funny to me how all the same love and hate applies. The tone is beautiful, dark but rich sounding. The weight is ridiculously heavy and is better suited to studio recording I think. The neck is wonderful to play. I wonder how much the Ibanez versions sold for in the 70's?

They are magnificent instruments.  Extremely light, durable and the blend between piezo and mags makes them versatile.

I'd check out Godin, they have many fantastic offerings that weigh under 8 lbs and are priced a lot better than those that you mentioned, while still maintaining good quality.","Get a strandberg. They are 2.5kg (5 lbs). If that doesn't tickle your pickle, look for any other chambered guitar body.
Parker Fly might be a good option, the only thing that'd make me nervous with them is the frets are epoxied on. If you need them replacing you'd previously contact Parker. But years ago washburn bought them then sunsetted the brand so that might be hard.",

Definitely out of consideration then. Thank you for your input!,"OK first some questions:
Do you need a floating bridge?
This to me seems like a really important point since floating bridges make some maintenance things a bit more convoluted and if you're a beginner you should take it into consideration.
If you don't need a floating bridge you can get a S521 new that's in your budget or a used S771 which used ranges from USD$400 to USD$500.
Are you willing to buy used?
You can get and S670QM for under USD$400 throught GC's used section in great condition  and the S771 the I mentioned earlier.
Personally I have a S670QM, it doesn't go great with me at the moment but I bought it because when I was a teenager I was into metal and a lot of friends had RG's and SA's and always wanted. To me, it's the most comfortable guitar ever, the lacquered neck is super smooth, the neck is nice and thin and the light body makes the guitar easy on the shoulders.
The cons, the pickups aren't that great and you should check what's comfortable for your picking position, the middle pickup in the HSH configuration gets in the way for some people.
Overall, I think they're really good guitars just because of how comfortable they are albeit they might need some changes along the way.",Which model would you recommend if I wanted to buy brand new and with tremolo? I reckon S520? Ofc used will still be an option that I'll consider. EDIT: Forgot to thank you for the response :),Love my Ibanez S540fm it is such a solid and sweet feeling guitar solid and well made. I have a Gibson SG with a thick neck and I like the Ibanez a little better although neck size doesn't matter to me much. If I had to keep one I would keep the Ibanez also I rarely play anything heavier than AC/DC and never bought into the this guitar is for this kind of music and no other crap. It's all about the feel and falling in love with the guitar.

Ibanez Series S,Is Ibanez SR300EB the right bass for me ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bass/comments/phh2wy/is_ibanez_sr300eb_the_right_bass_for_me/,"Yes, the pickups in combination with the powertap switch will give you jazz voicings (split), something like a P in humbucker mode, and really thick in powertap. Ibanez have done really well in making something crazy flexible.
My main bass is an old PJ style Washburn, it's much modded but I like the neck. I've never got on with the P/J arrangement, it just doesn't do the jazz sweet spot thing and it's noisy with both pickups where a jazz is almost silent with both pickups as similar levels. When I build basses it's always pairs of matching pickups.
Incidentally the older Ibanez DX4 and DX5 soapbars are staggered coils and magnets inside like a P and the neck DX4 and 5 are voiced crazy close to to a P. The set suffers though through not being able to get the brighter jazz tones, I think the powertap design is trying to cover MM and Jazz tones with some smart switching.","I have this one. Based on your needs I recommend it.
It's light and very comfortable. The electronics allow for a bunch of different sounds. Your fears of the EQ not changing much are not justified - I sometimes think it changed too much, in fact.
The distorted sounds are not a problem, as the pedals will matter more that the bass itself. For clean tones, you can get closer to J, P etc by fiddling with EQ, pickup blend, power tap switch (learn to use them and experiment a lot) and of course, where you pluck the strings.
There are only few sounds I couldn't get out of it. My main complaint is that I can't get much of that ""growl"" that J basses have. New strings help a bit; pedals such as overdrives might help too, but I didn't spend much time on it.
I recommend getting the bass and a cheap multi effect pedals (Zoom B1Four is pretty cheap and good enough for figuring out what you like) for maximum versatility.","Thanks. This was the kind of answer I was looking for. The amp I'm most likely going to buy is Fender Rumble 40 with built in overdrive. And in the later future I want to buy a multieffects pedal both for my guitar and bass. Something like boss gt 100 or line6 pod go. I was asking If I put the effects, would the bass allow me to get the sound I want",,"Apart from the clean tone your amp or distortion pedals will play a bigger role in achieving the tones you want, Newstead & Lemmy both use heavily distorted tones.

Ibanez Series S,Help Getting a New Bass,https://www.reddit.com/r/BassGuitar/comments/pynp64/help_getting_a_new_bass/,"I played a V7 mark I for a number of years, so I can't speak to the Mark II. It did a really fantastic job getting that super funky fusion jazz sound. However, it lacked a lot of versatility in my experience for other styles such as rock type genres.
The neck is great. It plays super well. I loved playing but found it lacking for any of my Rock projects so I eventually sold it as it was never getting played. Tonally it was very Hi fi sounding and the passive mode was lacking strong jazz p/u tones. So if thats your jam, its a great bass. I believe the Mark II was supposed to have better p/u's and a better overall tone.
Maybe someone else can speak to that. Unless I wanted a hi-fi tone, I would buy go with a Fender or derivative jazz.
Cheers mate.","As another owner of a Mk1 V7 and an American Jazz, I pretty much agree with this. I would say the V7's bare tone is quite a mid scoopy (surprise surprise, a very 'Marcus Miller') sound, but the onboard preamp goes a long way in improving it's versatility, you can boost some mids back in for a more pokey growl. The Mk2 seems to be an all round improvement too so I would be very surprised it if doesn't do the job very well
Another potential contender? If you just want that classic passive J tonal range like the Fender would give, the Sire V5 Mk2 is similar to the V7 but no preamp, instead they get a roasted maple satin finish neck. The V7 has a glossy neck which is not bad in any way, but personally I much prefer the feel of a Satin finish and would love to try the V5 for that reason.
The Fenders can be great basic instruments but there is a premium for the name on the headstock, with the Sire that money goes into the instrument instead.",,Thanks for the input man,Id buy the Fender even though it isn‚Äôt an American.

better components (tuners, pickups, bridge, frets)
Does the quality keep increasing consistently through the whole lineup or are there hardware ""softcaps"" between models? Poorly phrased question, I know, but all I'm saying is - what's the price difference between a SR500E and a SR600E due to?
afaik all pickups are passive (with active electronics/EQ)
That should be correct, I think, that's probably why they caught my attention. The ""-E"" in the name should stand for EQ.
Probably all time consuming procedures are done more thoroughly on the more expensive models.
Yep, that's likely the case.",,"I pretty much exclusively play Ibanez SR basses and have played and or owned most models. Here is my subjective experience-
Little difference between 300, 370, and 400 series besides finish. All the current models have the powerspan pickups which aren't bad, not particularly good either. But solid. Also I find the neck stability on these can vary greatly. I have a fretless SR375 (older version with CAP pickups) that's neck is rock solid. But I had a SR405 that needed adjustments a couple times a month. I've heard similar stories from others.
500 series are better build quality and the new ones have the Bartolini BH2 pickups which I think are a step up from the MK1 in the older versions. Really great bass for the money.
600 series- haven't tried the new ones but I'm huge fan of the 650 series these are replacing. Nordstrand pickups are stellar. Build quality is the same as 500 but finish options are nicer.
I'd say go with the 500 or 600 series. Just a difference in preference between the Bartolini or Nordstrand sound.
Really though I always recommend just finding a used premium. Everything about them is better. You can find good deals if you're patient. I paid about 700 USD for my SR1405e. That's a rarer deal but I think 800-900 is reasonable if you shop around.
My main bass is a prestige SR5005 but the premium series are pretty darn close in quality to the prestige.
Hope my small essay is helpful!","Heck yeah dude, this is the best answer I could've possibly asked for, hahah!

Till now we only have 2 proper full backs available (Vi√±a and Karsdorp) Spina is injured for 5-6 months. Calafiori and Reynolds are still light imo. We also lack dark arts and experience which is important for a winning team, players like(Bonucci,Chiellini,Vidal,Zlatan) with Dzeko departure we dont have that experience player anymore.",Zaniolo wasnt a flop. Rick and Vi√±a were,"For the match overall, i think yes. Basing on his performance on the pitch, he wasn't. Vi√±a wasn't a flop, this was his first european game, he tried to do his job seriously."
Ibanez Series S,Looking to buy a new guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ibanez/comments/pp9je2/looking_to_buy_a_new_guitar/,"I have the RGD4327 and I love it but the string tension is pretty tight for bending so I end up using the tremolo more. If you are gonna play metal riffs and chugging, the Dimarzio Fusion Edge would not beat the Fluence Modern which I have on my RG 6 strings. The Fusion Edge surprisingly sounds good for overdriven lead tones instead, I prefer the Fusion Edge than the Fluence Modern in this matter because the Fluence sounds less life-ly.","So which one is it? Baritone or tremolo system? Because those are two completly oposite directions imo. I just bought an rgd71alms-bam, and since (like all rgds) its a longer scale it does a great job in low tunings. But how many people playing in drop f want a tremolo? Rgds and similar long scale guitars are Modern metal machines, but if youre not into the djenty stuff, i would say a baritone is absolutly not neccecary if  you dont plan on using 8-string tunings like drop f# or lower, and id even tell you to think twice about it...",,,

Ibanez Series S,[QUESTION] Pre-ordering a guitar from Sweetwater in Canada,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/oxc0j6/question_preordering_a_guitar_from_sweetwater_in/,"Honestly, with Sweetwater, I‚Äôm willing to wager that if there is a major problem with the guitar that they will take care of it. They truly are a great company. I think you should be fine, just wait 24hrs to open the box when you get it so the guitar can acclimate if it‚Äôs cold or humid.
Also, depending on where you are in Canada, you‚Äôre probably closer to their shipping warehouse than the thousands of Californians who order from them all the time.
Both Ibanez and Sweetwater have good QC, you should get exactly what you ordered. Your guitar will almost definitely need a new setup, but that‚Äôs relatively easy with a couple YouTube vids","Thank you for the box opening tip I had no idea.
Yeah they really sound quite good from everything i've seen about them. My only local options are a couple hours drive each way to their stores. I've only ever had used so i've never interacted with warranties before.
I will take a look at some setup videos!","or support from the manufacturer.
To my knowledge this shouldn't be true. Generally if you have a proof of purchase and register the instrument, then the manufacturer won't GAF where you bought the guitar from. That said there might be some exceptions if Ibanez specifically doesn't serve Canada or have warranty repair centers there, but I'd be very surprised if that was true.
That said - is there another Canadian-specific retailer you could order from instead? Save yourself the import fees and MAP price is MAP price. Sweetwater is great but if someone local can offer the same price, then why not order from them?","Yeah I asked them about international warranty on guitars and they sent me their international sales terms which I may be misinterpreting:
2) You will not be eligible for support from the manufacturer, or any local dealer/distributor, however you will have access to Sweetwater's own expert support team.
The list also included:
3) The gear we carry is meant for the United States marketplace. .... We would also ask that you not register the gear we send you with the manufacturers.  Since the only warranty would be through us, there would be no benefit to registering with them.
L&M and musicredone seem to be my canadian options. Their stores are a couple hours drive each way which is when I started also considering sweetwater mostly because of the reviews.
I've only had used guitars so when it came to sweetwater I just wasn't sure about the importance of warranty on a brand new one.",

Playing into a digital interface like that is cool and cuts down on clutter, but I really enjoy the analog effects processing you can get from a pedal board.

Ibanez Series S,PRS SE Custom 24 or Ibanez S series,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/21q6s9/prs_se_custom_24_or_ibanez_s_series/,"Two great choices.
The PRS is more of a traditional guitar, the S will be a more modern shredding machine - most of the S's come with a Floyd Rose.
The S's are very light with their super contoured body, the PRS are a bit more balanced and have the feel of a traditional electric guitar.","The PRS stock tremolo is great, IMO. The only problem is that the tuners don't hold tuning well if you (ab)use the tremolo a lot. But you can always change out the tuners to some locking tuners. The Ibanez S has a floyd rose, which IMO is a major hassle. However, it holds tuning very well. The Ibanez will have a slimmer neck and is probably better for shredding. Not saying that the PRS isn't great but that's more of a traditional guitar. Try them both and see which one is more comfortable/feels right for you.","Have you tried both? If not... try them. And pick the one that suits you best.
People here are going to make their opinion based on their personal preferences, and other people's personal preferences shouldn't really matter to you.
I have a PRS SE one and fucking love it. I personally don't like the Ibanez' S line. But... thats me, and no one should really give a fuck about my personal preferences but me.","They're pretty different, but the biggest difference is traditional 6 screw trem vs. double locking Floyd.
The ZR on the S series is my favorite trem in terms of feel, plus virtually all my guitars have Floyds and I love how light the S series is. So I'm biased.","Definitely the PRS. Higher quality, classier, will hold resale value better and more versatile. The SE necks are pretty slim and comfortable as well, so if you're used to ""shredder"" necks, it's not going to be a major discomfort like a Les Paul would."

Ibanez Series S,Questions on Standard Bodens,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strandberg/comments/og4si2/questions_on_standard_bodens/,"So I only have an original and I have never had my hands on a standard, but a couple thoughts for you.
First, my finish on my original is very meh.  The whole point and purpose of Strandberg is function and tone over looks, they even say on their site that the roasted maple necks come in a wide range of colors because they rost to the right moisture content for tone, not appearance.  My Ibanez Presteige finish absolutely knocks the boden out of the park, no contest.
I have the strandberg trem and in terms of stability I think it's similar to a floyd (never had an edge), however it does feel different, not different bad, but enough that it takes some getting used to.
I have loved the gig bag and I didn't think I would.  The guitar is so light that the bag is plenty to protect it unless you are trying to break it.  I LOVE how quick and easy it is to pack up, throw on my back, and walk out the door.
Overall, it is absolutley my favorite guitar I have ever owned, and I have had Prestieges, artist series Paul Reed Smiths, an arm load of USA gibsons, and many others to compare to.  I'm not sure if the standard holds up, but I wanted to put in my two cents about the guitar.
I will say there have been some little quirks to deal with that I don't have to deal with other top teir brands.  There was an issue where my bridge was part of a batch that was sent out defective, they have a video on how to fix it, took 15 min and a dot of glue and it worked, but at 2400 you don't expect to do that.  I had some sticky spots on the first fret when I would bend that I had to fix with a nail file, again easy fix, but 2400.  The bridge can be a little tricky to tune by design, you get used to it though.  Mine happened to show up damaged from GC (good sized chuck of wood missing near then input jack, maybe the size of the tip of my thumb), they gave me back 400 dollars and I kept it because despite all the issues I was falling in love with the guitar.  It is my #1 player and I have never been overall happier with a guitar, but it is a new brand, small company, many bugs still being ironed out.  So my point is, do you want an extremely well engineered, great sounding, fantastic playing, super light guitar that falls short is a few categories that can be dealt with, or for the same or lesser cost, do you want a guitar that is as close to perfect as you can get, but is just like a million other guitars out there.
Again, I don't have a standard, but based on your post I wanted to chime in to give you a good idea of what you do and don't get with strandberg.  They are not for everyone, but I love mine so fucking much I want to buy more of them lol.",Thanks for such a detailed answer! Really appreciated!,If the finish is a deal breaker find a different guitar. Everything else is high quality in my experience.,"-As a guitar tech that inspects dozens of different brands I think as long as you like satin polyurethane then contemporary Boden Standards have nice finishes
-You're good to go on for most strings (including D'Addario). Its when you get into 8 string territory that you have to worry about what strings you get.
-The trems are as stable as a strat trem (not too great with dive bombs) but an everloving nightmare to set up
-I just got back from a 5 state trip that i took my Boden along with on the whole time and didnt have any issues. Mind you this was in a trunk with luggage rolling around","The gig bag is fantastic. Absolutely perfect for the instrument, travel, etc."

A lot of mediocre players just stick to the bridge pickup, dial in a bunch of treble and go for making your ears bleed. But if you can go to the incredible effort of flipping a single switch and fiddling with a single tone knob the guitar has a nice tonal range. A 
 can make the telecaster rip your ears off or warm the cockles of your heart (see the middle section of the instrumental).
However
I think if you're after a different range of sound then my advice would be to try one of the Gibson range (Les Paul, Les Paul Jr, ES-335, SG, &c.) and just go with whichever guitar you enjoy playing the most.",Nothing quite like middle position on a tele with the tone rolled back a little bit,,As a former Esquire owner I am insulted by this!

Ibanez Series S,[QUESTION] Question re: Floyd Rose-equipped Jacksons,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/p5ttxb/question_question_re_floyd_roseequipped_jacksons/,Tune it. Lock down the nut. Adjust the fine tuning on the Floyd Rose Bridge.,"Jackson traditionally don't have string retainer. You just learn to work with it (tune it slightly flat so it evens out when you screw in the nut, then use the fine tuners).","That seems to be the easiest option. A retainer would be ideal, but I'm not installing one, lol.","You should have enough range on the fine tuners to compensate. You can tune slightly flat in anticipation, or install a retainer yourself.","I've always heard stories of tuning going sharp when locking down the nut clamps on some guitars, but never had the issue on my Ibanez. I'm doing a bit of setup on the new guitar and changed string gauge and noticed I had this issue. I watched a video on Youtube that explained what the cause is; the lack of a string retainer bar on Floyd-equipped causes the string to only make contact at the front of the nut. I read a bit on it and most Jackson owners claim the headstock angle alleviates this, but I have this happening.
That is definitely the issue that you've got here.  I'm surprised they don't have a retainer bar.  The only thing I can think of for you to do is to put in more windings in your strings so that it brings the string break angle down further, but I'm not sure if that would bring it down enough to flatten across the nut."

Most likely from the artwood vintage series. I couldn't find any photos exactly like that tho. it's probably from late 90's to early 00's. Pricewise it's hard to say how much one is worth, but it's made in japan so I guess quite high-end one. Cleaned up that would probably sell at somewhere around 500-1000. That's just my guess though.
Edit: Apparently the artwood series was introduced in around 2014 or so. I guess it just looks older because it has some wear and tear. If it is from the artwood series then it's probably worth like 200-300. If it's actually vintage it might be worth alot more but it doesn't look like one.
Edit 2: Found it! It's an Ibanez V-390 from late 70's to early 80's. I saw couple reverb listings at 400, 600 and 1100 Euros. Convert those to your currency. That's a really good find.

Ibanez Series S,"[NEWBIE] Looking for a first electric guitar/amp that can ""do it all""",https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/nq4no7/newbie_looking_for_a_first_electric_guitaramp/,"Sounds like you've already done your research. Personally I feel the Yamaha THR10 is the better sounding and more practical beginner amp but the Boss Katana can work in a band. I will always recommend Yamaha's guitars regardless of their price range.
Dual humbucker vs H/S/S is personal preference. Dual humbuckers with coil split can be very versatile but so is H/S/S.
If your budget can stretches to it, you could also consider the Yamaha Pacifica 311 with a bridge humbucker and neck P90. P90s are basically a fatter sounding single coil that is kind of humbuckerish but brighter.
There's no right or wrong here and all of them will do a variety of styles just fine.","Thanks. I like the THR10 too but feel like it doesn't quite offer what boss does with the brown sound. But other than that it's fantastic. Eventually I'd like to practise and maybe even play small venues with a band, would the katana be more suitable for that than the THR10 or both will work fine?",,"Yamaha Pacifica (either one will do, choose what you prefer) and Boss Katana amp.","I own both a Pacifica 112j and an Ibanez RG421 and they're both awesome guitars.  Personally, I think the RG plays a little better and the stock pickups are versatile enough you can do just about anything with them.  However the Yamaha HH with the coil tap will definitely get you a better and truer single coil tone, especially if you're worried about the bridge pickup tone being single coil.  Just some food for thought on that one.
Between the amps I thought the Yamaha sounded a little better than the Katana but since it was more expensive and had less features I thought the Katana was a better value so I bought that instead and don't regret it.
Honestly more than telling you what I think you should buy I'd be giving you advice on how to figure out what you think you should buy.  Look up a ton of youtube videos and reviews, maybe download user manual pdfs and read those.  However, it sounds like you're already doing alot of that, so all I can say is just understand the limitations of your budget and you're not going to get something to cover every possible tone, so figure out which configuration can handle the genres you most want to play."

Ibanez Series S,Suggestions for a Floyd / Floating trem guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/guitars/comments/p9vy11/suggestions_for_a_floyd_floating_trem_guitar/,"From what I've heard the cheaper floyds and Specials are a bit ""weak"" so they wear quickly, so I've been looking at the Floyd Rose 1000 series.
I wouldn't say that Specials wear quickly (as long as you take care of them), but they will generally be worn out before a 1000 or OFR. Otherwise they perform pretty much the same in terms of performance and tuning stability and are relatively cheap to replace in the future, so I wouldn't rule them out completely if you find a guitar that is otherwise perfect.
Licensed Floyds are a whole other thing and can be as good or better than an OFR, or they can be pretty much totally useless pieces of aluminum foil garbage.
But your budget is well within FR1000 territory, and even OFR in some cases, so I would definitely go that route.
I love Kramers, but the 84 is a single pickup instrument. If you're into that, that's cool, but it's pretty limiting IMO.
Those Charvels are supposed to be really awesome. I haven't had a chance to play one, but I would be comfortable buying one without trying it if I were in the market for one, if that means anything.
I do own the SE Custom 24 Floyd. It is an awesome instrument and I would recommend it without hesitation.
Also check out Schecter's offerings. Their guitars can look a little like decorative toilet seats at times, but they are built well, play well, and they have their own exclusive Floyd Rose 1500. It's essentially a FR1000 with a few upgrades like a push-in arm and stainless screws. Plus, they have lots of offerings with Sustainiacs, which are awesome.","I love Kramers, but the 84 is a single pickup instrument. If you're into that, that's cool, but it's pretty limiting IMO.
Thanks for the reply and all the info!
I've got a friend in Canada who's got that Charvel and he swears by it. From what I've seen online it all supports their praise as well. I'm pretty set on it, as it seems very versatile as well, especially for essentially being a superstrat.
As for the PRS, that's also really high up on the list. I really like what I've HEARD about PRS guitars, though I've never tried one.
Right now it's mainly between that and the Charvel, but I'm still looking for options before I pick one out.
I've checked with almost every dealer within a 350 mile radius and noone has these PRS guitars (Though I can order online)
How is the trem on these? I know it's an FR1000, so I'm guessing it's quite stable and doesn't have issues returning to 0? (Properly set up that is)
I have looked at some Schecters actually, the Sun Valley Super Shredders seem quite decent. Do you know how the neck is on those?
I know the best way to figure this out is by trying the guitar at a store, but there isn't many big stores in Norway that carries PRS / Schecter / Charvel, and those who do is kind of too far away (10hr drive one way) or doesn't have many models..",,I've got two Peavey Vandenbergs with Kahler Spyders...

I'm from the US.  I've ordered several. And any issues have been extremely minor.  Needing a set up, maybe smoothing out some fret ends, or oiling up the fretboard.  This is all extremely fixable, at very very minimal cost.
These guitars have always exceeded my expectations.   I dont think you will find anything in that price range that's better if I'm being completely honest.  I certainly wouldn't take any Squier over a Harley Benton.  Maybe the Classic Vibe series, but you're talking a guitar that's more than double the price, and not much better at all, if any.  If you're talking squier bullet/affinity guitars, absolutely not.","I think the ""problems"" are people playing much more expensive guitars buying them and then comparing their ‚Ç¨800 with the ‚Ç¨159 Hb. It's a ‚Ç¨159 guitar so that's what you get, but the Hbs Ive seem are all fine and will blow what you have out of the water.","My ST-62 Sunburst is great.  Had no sharp ends, plays well, pickups are decent for cheap ones.    I polished the frets, oiled the fretboard and put some Elixirs on it not too long ago.  Plays great and stays in tune.  I think I paid $127 for it a year ago.","Playing for 20 years and have one in my collection. Bought it in 2018. For the price it is an excellent guitar, sounds nice and had no sharp edges or other problems. I had to straighten the neck a little bit and adjust the action, but nothing to bad. The fretwork is very good for the price, I was able to lower the action to <2mm on the low E and <1,5mm on the high E and no fretbuzz at all. Of course, the tuners aren't the best and the bridge is kinda cheap, but I had worse in guitars that cost double or more.
The only negative thing was that the tremarm got stuck like 1 year after I got it but Thomann fixed it with no charge, they even paid the shipping.
The neck is a vintage C so its kinda chunky. When I got it I wasn't sure if it's the right fit for me, I normally play thinner necks, but I got used to it quite quickly and really enjoy playing the thing. It feels good in the hand and most importantly, it makes me play a little bit different but in a positive way. So I wouldn't worry too much about it. Normally thomann offers a 30 Day Money back guarantee (at least in Central Europe where I'm from) so just try it, if you don't like it send it back.
In my opinion a bang for the money, perfekt for a beginner and if you like to learn to service or mod your guitar yourself an excellent Plattform.",

Ibanez Series S,[QUESTION] Acoustic player newto electric,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/pflb99/question_acoustic_player_newto_electric/,"You could look at a high end Epiphone 
Make sure you understand the difference between single coil and double coil (aka humbucker) pickups.  And avoid a Floyd Rose bridge unless you have researched it and know that is what you want.
For an amp, you might look at a digital modeling amp like a Katana MK2 or Fender Mustang LT or GTX model.  These amps have a huge variety of built in effects.  You would be able to dial in whatever tone you wanted without the need for additional effect pedals.","I back the amp choices would add check out the spark amp.
For guitars I‚Äôd decide first on fixed bridge or a trem style bridge. Decide on humbuckers or single coils or a combination like hsh or hss (I‚Äôd do one of these so you get the best of both worlds). Ibanez in the $500+ range is going to be amazing. Schecter has some good ones but I find a lot feel geared towards metal, but not all of their guitars. Epiphone or for $1000 you might be able to find used PRS SE or used Fender telecaster - you said you didn‚Äôt like strat :(
In any case research different guitars and pickup configurations. And maybe look into some of your favorite players and see what they used",Agreed on the Floyd Rose... or just floating bridges in general. We want to practice playing the guitar more than practicing tuning the guitar.,"For those genres, a high-end Epiphone SG or Les Paul, or a PRS SE (lets you have both humbucker and single coil sounds) into a Supro Delta King 10 (5 watt) is an awesome not too pricey setup. What about the strat neck didn't work for you?
The Blackstar HT5R combo is another great ""budget"" tube amp. Both of these have a built in reverb so you wouldn't need that pedal. Of course there's the Boss Katana, which is really great for what it does, but solid state amps just don't do it for me. I own both. You may love the Katana.
Getting a tube amp with an overdrive channel that you enjoy might mean not having to get an overdrive pedal(s) at the get go. Make sure you understand the difference between amps that have a master volume and overdrive channel, and amps that only have gain and/or volume.
The basic, main flavors of pedals are: boost, overdrive, distortion, fuzz, wah wah, delay, chorus, phaser, and reverb. I'd say a good overdive/distortion pedal and a reverb are the best to start with.
If you want to experiment of modulation/time pedals like delays and reverbs, like the Strymon Big Sky, make sure your amp has an ""Effects Loop."" That Supro does not, but the Blackstar does. Those types of effects generally sound better placed after the amp's preamp distortion, which is what the effects loop does.","Definitely go with a digital amp if you aren‚Äôt playing gigs or anything, they come loaded with any tone you could want which is great for practicing (especially switching genres around).
As for guitars, I would recommend going to your local guitar store and trying a couple out. Hard to go wrong with a strat especially for what your playing. You can get a used American made one for around your budget"

I like the  Fender scale length, and find it weird going back and forth between a shorter and the longer on my electric.","I love that DRJ. They look awesome. Glad you're not having tuner issues. I definitely am, but it's not the biggest thing in the world.
Definitely check out some Breedloves. You get a ton of value and they sound amazing.","I'm driving to Washington from Vegas in a clue weeks. Gonna take the longer route through Bend, OR and see the Breedlove shop. I'm sure I won't leave empty handed.","My personal thoughts on these 2 as I‚Äôve tried both and owned a Martin road series, the Martin just plays nicer overall (with a set up and different strings) , it‚Äôs smooth, bright and comfortable‚Ä¶the BL was nice but seemed to lack something, maybe it was the one I had the chance to play‚Ä¶ I took a serious look at one before I bought my recording king rd328 as the guy at the store tried to sell me on it.  Maybe it was the neck feel or tone but it really just lacked.","Awesome. Thank you for the thoughts. What strings do you find work well with the Martin?
I‚Äôd like to make what I have work for me.

If you are interested in an 8 string, dont go with an RG8.  Yes, they are decent guitars, but you can get a much better guitar within your budget, such as:
 Schecter Damien Platinum 8

Back in the day, all I wanted were the hottest pickups I could find. Overwound, biggest magnet like Alnico 5 or field magnets or whatever.
Then one day, I picked up a Les Paul with alnico 2 and 3 magnets, low wind, like 7.2 output on both pickups. The dynamic range and ability to go from whisper to rock in a single passage was amazing. The harmonics and detail and clarity you could hear was something I'd never heard. It was like I could finally hear my guitar breathing when I finally updated.
I'm still on the hunt for the best low wind, unpotted pickups that aren't Throwbaks.","When I was a teenager, one of the first things I did was swap the single coils in my strat with rails. It was an answer to most of my gain problems.

Ibanez Series S,About AX series guitars...,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ibanez/comments/q4ihy4/about_ax_series_guitars/,"I collect AX series guitars. What exactly would you like to know? The 
 has good breakdowns of all the models, btw. Edit: I just noticed you already linked to this, lol. Sorry:(
The Gio line: Cheaper woods like bass wood or agathis, and cheaper hardware. Probably have the Powersound pickups. Old GAX models are actually surprisingly good. I have a GAX30, GAX70, and a GAX75. All good players. The new AX series that I've tried have kind of sucked. Buy used.
The non-Gio AX are usually mahogany bodies and the big differences in the models are the hardware selections. Most have decent tuners, basic but functional bridges and Axis humbuckers, which I really don't care for but that's a personal thing. ""Regular"" AX models also have a slightly different headstock from from the Gio models.
The AXS 32 and 42 are set neck versions. The AXS32 has string though and the AXS42 has a stop tailpiece. I don't think there is anything else different about them. (I guess the 42 has block inlays while the 32 has no inlays except at the 12th fret.)
The D-Tuner actually works pretty well if you get it set up right, which isn't hard, but you don't have to use it and you can either string it up and ignore it, string it to the bridge like the other strings, or do that and actually remove the D-tuner. The bridge used in that case is a wrap around and the 6th string isn't machined any differently. The bridge works fine on its own without the D-tuner. I have the D-tuner on a GAX75 and an AX125. If all you can find is a model with the D-tuner, you can ignore it, don't buy based on it being there or not unless you really want it.
There were a lot of one-off models, especially in Japan, but in the states, your big choices for used models will be:
 (with replacement pickups)
 (with replacement pickups)
 (same thing as the GAX70 with D-tuner)
 (with replacement pickups)
 (same thing as the AX120 with D-tuner)
 (same thing as the AX120 with a maple veneer)
 (7 string - There's also the Japanese 7521 but it's rarer here)
 (set neck version - this one has Railhammer pickups in it)
There are others but these are what you find in large enough numbers to consider.
If you are looking at a new one, look on the higher end like the 230 (not sure if that is still being made, though). The new 120s have some serious issues with fret finishing and other finish details. Loose pots, crappy hardware, etc. Not sure why, but the old ones are good and the new ones really are not.","Thank you for writing this.
Mainly I just want personal experiences and opinions of these. If you compare AX and GAX models, is there big difference in how they feel and play, or weight? I'm not big fan of open humbucker so if I get a guitar with those, I might toss in 1 or 2 closed humbs. Tuners I won't touch, as long as they keep my strings in order. What about that D-tuner... is there some piece I can just snip off of do I have to change the whole tuner ? Not sure if I explained that right...   I don't ask for much, I just want my guitar to be able to play those punk power chords well in my hands and handle few bends without neck snapping and shooting scross the room.  I've been using Epiphone LP for 20 years and that's very good guitar to me. It's mine and I like it. Just wondering if these (G)AX guitars will be huge downgrade in playing feel...
I got response from my Ibanez dealer. According to him , 
 is the only model available anymore. Even Reverb doesn't have much of these... especially black ones seem to be super rare. By the way, I live in Europe.",,"GAX30 (with replacement pickups)

From who have you heard that? I strongly disagree. A sr 500 will drown in the mix. (well unless you seek that korn tone, that stands out).
Bass just being subby on the background is something you often see in metal that is very guitar oriented. And that can be achieved with a ibanez sr 500 nicely but that can be done with most basses anyway. But that sound is often chosen to leave more room for the other instruments and not really a great tone bass players like to choose in metal. I think the ibanez sr 500 fits soul, r&b and singer songwriter.
The newer sr models have nordstrand pickups, they're much punchier.
Would I be missing out on the beefy, metal tone I desperately crave?
What sound do you crave? Got any examples?","ESP LTD F-204 BLKS

If I'm totally off the mark here, please correct me.",I'd get one if they threw in a hockey jersey and an alien text-to-speech foot controller.,"It's honestly one of the best-sounding 8 string guitars I've ever played. The scale length takes some getting used to but it also allows you to use lighter gauge strings towards the heavier side which in turn helps it sound more like a guitar and less like a bass. As one can imagine, this is SUPER useful when going hella low in terms of tuning.",I was thinking about getting a 7-string guitar but then I realized I am only barely decent at a 6-string.,"Own one, and several other 8-strings to compare it to.
It truly is it‚Äôs own, awesome thing. The scale length takes some getting used to, and it also make string bends nearly impossible on higher pitched strings.
PRO: It sounds incredible. It hold tuning like a monster. Intonation is stellar. One of the best instruments I own for tapping. Price point is truly reasonable for what you get. Lighter weight than you‚Äôd ever think for a 29.4‚Äù scale. Feels like you‚Äôre playing a cosmic weapon born within a black hole. The neck is STUPID thin.
CON: High pitch string bends, as I said, are work or outright not happening. Second, but important: I have carpal tunnel and tendinitis, so playing the M80M for long stretches of time is out of the question. The scale length wreaks havoc on my arms when playing technical items between frets 1 and 5. Your mileage may vary ‚Äî my limbs are borked.
Alternative options: Strandberg 8 (any of them - Endurneck saved my arms), ESP LTD JR-608.

I like to change my strings alot... I have toxic hand goo... and doing a string-swap with a Floyd is a pain in the ass. It requires more time, more tools, more stretching, the works. Also, the techniques one can pull with a locking trem are, to my ears, kind of goofy. I'm talking about the Dimebag dive bombs and Vai-esque glisses into notes.
Then again, I've been playing fixed-bridge for fifteen years or more. Maybe they've become better than the ball-cutting, allen-wrench-required days of my youth.","When I used to play a guitar with a floyd, I usually just strung it up with the ball ends at the tuners and then cut off the free ends. Finally quit using them since a broken string meant i was done until the end of the song.","My sister owns an S470DXQM, and its a pretty decent guitar.  Personally, I'd take the RG over the S series just by personal preference.
Main difference from the RG is the mahogany body, which will favor your low end tons over your mids and highs.  Stock pickups are decent (better than RG stocks) but you're still better off replacing them, and the ZR bridge is a novelty, but it really doesn't give a notable advantage over the edge trems.  As for the D tuna, you could possibly use the fine tuners to drop the low E string a full step.  That usually works best, when you don't want to retune the entire guitar.
Personally, I'm a fan for the RG's because of the 24 frets and the sharper tone, but you can't go wrong with mahogany.  It's really up to your personal preference, but I'll tell you, you won't be disappointed if you go RG or S-series.","I love playing Ibanez guitars, period.  One problem though... If you are a touring musician, THEY WILL BREAK.
Bells n whistles are nice, but do you really need them?
Oh, and if you're buying a guitar, please play it first.  I will never purchase a guitar without holding it, smelling it, tasting it and most importantly playing it.","My first guitar was an el-cheapo Ib (GRG), and it is still going like a Boeing (although I don't play it much these days). However, I have heard that the past few years Indonesian locking trems do occasionally give trouble - something (can't remember precisely what I was told) breaks on the bridge. But that was hearsay.
That being said, I know a guy who has had an S series fixed bridge model, and I have never heard him complain. Body shape takes some getting used to, but I quite enjoyed the couple of times I played the instrument."

I usually want to recommend a fixed bridge instead of a floating bridge for beginners, as string changes and setup is easier on a fixed. still, I wouldnt pass that up, even if its got a floating bridge.
Ibanez is a really good guitar company. metal heads like to shred, they need a guitar that plays fast, easy, and accurate, with good feel and action...but all those things benefit every genre! its just the shredders play style demands it.
is the S series a good guitar?
I fucking love mine. the body is incredibly thin and comfortable. H-S-H pickup configuration makes it really versatile. the stock pickup arent amazing, but thats basically true of any guitar in any brand. still, you can get some good tones out of them, and the output is not bad at all. locking tuners are also a really nice high quality feature you dont usually find on a guitar for $200.
ok, im no amazing player...but since you like blues, and I recorded a short little blues practice the other night, Ill share it with you. gonna send it in a PM, cause my soundcloud has my name on it.","i have an s470, it was my first guitar, paid about $700 for it about 15 years ago. i would definitely recommend it. the bridge and neck pickups are whatever,  but the middle pickup sounds great. playability wise, it plays really well. the zr tremelo, imo, is just as good if not better than a floyd rose. neck is a 3 or 5 piece, incredibly stable. its deceptively heavy if you get the mahogany one. fwiw, its my workhorse, and usually what i gig with.
edit: i see you play rnb, funk and blues. i do as well, and have selected my pickups to suit this (seymour Duncan 59 on neck, stock middle pickup sunk down low to get clean tones while the other two are hot, seymour duncan invader, cause i like my highs pretty sharp, but it only goes ""heavy"" if i push it on the amp.)"

Ibanez Series S,Most Versatile Guitar: Fender HSS or Ibanez S Series S621QM?,https://www.reddit.com/r/guitars/comments/9oysnh/most_versatile_guitar_fender_hss_or_ibanez_s/,Personally i like ibanez i feel like you‚Äôll get a little more for your money although it is sided more towards metal and not blues but i bet it would be fine at blues.,"You should really play them if you can, or at least have an idea of what kind of neck you like. Ibanez have very thin flat necks, while the Fender will be a C shape with a moderate radius.
I did not like the player Strat when I tried one, to my surprise. Something about the fretboard felt unfinished, like the didn't round the edges enough compared to my 09 MIM. This is just, like, my opinion man.
As far as sound, pick your sacrifice. The Fender will have a more vintage flavored tone with the sweetest of clean and crunch tones, the Ibanez will be voiced for more overdriven tones I bet. I have also head a lot of people poop on the stock Ibanez pups, take that for what it's worth.","Brand names aside, I don't know how anyone could think HH is more versatile than HSS.
I have both. Last weekend I went to a friend's place to jam and wanted to do more and carry less, so I grabbed my HSS Strat and left my HH Ibanez at home. My drummer loooooves the sound of the Ibanez, it has SD 59s,  but it's not a Swiss army knife like the HSS. I even have a phase toggle on the Ibanez and it's still not the cover-everything road guitar.","I think the Fender overall will cover the most ground, but it depends on the sound you're going for. The Ibanez is still very versatile as well, and it cleans up well due to the 5-way switch it has. Its just a different type of sound you get out of humbuckers vs single coil. In the front or neck position, the Strat will sound more bright and the Ibanez will be more warm/smooth sounding when clean. Same goes for overdrive/distortion tones, the dynamics are just different and neither is necessarily flat out better. Both will sound 'bigger' in the rear/bridge pickup since they have humbuckers.
Personally if I'm going for a Strat I much prefer the SSS configuration. I think it gives you the best range of tones, I find jumping from single coils to a humbucker is just too much of a leap in sound and dynamics when playing so I never really liked the HSS Strat configuration. This is totally a preference thing though, so it will really depend on the sound you're after.
Not sure if this helps much, I'd try out both and see what sounds you prefer.",

The 521 is a fine instrument with easy access all over the neck and it has a comfortable body shape. I would worry more about the pickups (humbuckers are fine, but the stock pups on guitar of this price range can easily be replaced for aftermarket stuff without spending a boatload of money) and the signal chain (different music styles have different textures and, thus, require different types of pedals). I don't know how long you've been playing guitar, but a 521 with a cheap multi effects unit (Boss GT1 kind of thing) will get you quite far and let you experiment with different styles and textures without breaking the bank.","I like the Ibanez S series a lot, very versatile in my opinion and can cover those genres.  I own a JS though","Those RG and S guitars are very versatile. For math-rock, you shouldn‚Äôt have any issues.

The necks on S guitars are pretty flat and thin - I don‚Äôt find it too comfortable for playing chords but each to their own. Something to consider

I haven't played either them for a while but i seem to remember the RG being a lot heavier (in terms of weight) than the S series - I preferred the RG for that reason but if you're moving from a light guitar like a strat to Ibanez you might prefer the lighter weight of the S","I have owned both, and both are are solid, the S series are just way thinner with more flat body while the RG series have the classic super strat look. In terms of tone and playability both are pretty damn close but IIRC the S models with the same components are slightly more expensive.
In all I would say if one of the two styles isn't specifically calling to you, try to get to your local Ibanez dealer (even if its Guitar Center) and play around with both and decide from there. The lighter, thinner profile of  the S series might be a bonus if you are lugging it around, gigging, or play standing up for long periods but it's not a massive difference.
As for the tele, like others are saying if you don't have a humbucker in the bridge it probably won't be ideal for the heavier, beefy tones.",,

Ibanez Series S,[NEWBIE] [QUESTION] Ibanez RG or S series for Math Rock?,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/mwplnj/newbie_question_ibanez_rg_or_s_series_for_math/,"The S series is much thinner and lighter. The same pick-ups will sound the same on both models and usually have the same switching, which includes coil split or parallel humbuckers. The RG line has more models and will offer more variation.","It all depends on your preferences! You'll be able to get the same sound out of the S and RG line!
But I can't play on any guitar from the S line! The body is too slim/light for me!
The guys from CHON used to play on HH RGs before they got their signature AZs!",I've got an s series and it's body is much thinner and makes playing standing up more comfortable in my opinion. I don't play sitting down at all but I think it may not be as comfortable to play sitting down compared to the RG which is thicker.,Body style is purely an aesthetic/comfort preference. RG and S series use the same range of necks and pickups and with the same configuration will produce the same sounds.,"Neither. Yes they all play Ibanez, but they‚Äôre actually closer to a Fender Strat or Tele than a typical RG or Sabre (ichika actually just straight up plays a strat in several videos, and Yvette started on a telecaster and still uses Telecaster pickups on some guitars).  There‚Äôs no equivalent ‚Äòcheap‚Äô version of the Ibanez AZ or Talman. Check for uses Mexican Stratocasters, or get a Classic Vibe and put new pickups in and locking tuners.
You want an SSH setup for max versatility, and that‚Äôs what they all use besides Yvette.  Most importantly, buy a good compressor pedal: keeley, deep six or Warden are good options."

There‚Äôs nothing with exactly the same body style. I love them. The fixed bridge versions are like three fiddy, totally worth it. Might want to polish the frets but otherwise it‚Äôs great, no sharp tangs and it sounds like an Ibanez.","Nothing tapers like a saber. Which sucks, cuz I‚Äôd like a saber-thin guitar, but with colder pickups and a more traditionally radiused board.","It's arguably my favorite body type.

I would say to install all the hardware and see how much room you have for removing material. Best to also have an S series on hand to see how they were able to make it work.
EDIT: here's an S series body blank to get some ideas from: ","Useful, thank you!","You might have issues with the control cavity depth if you're adapting an existing body
Be aware the 17mm thick super wizard necks are laminated and scarf jointed for a reason.

All are Standard models. The S was introduced in 1987 and I don't know if it ""peaked"". I doubt there are reasons to think this.
That said, you'll get them a lot cheaper used because for some reason, Ibanez owners are not of the worshipping kind who think they buy some magic thing worth sacrificing to.",I own two S Prestiges and love them both. I'd say go for it as long as you like the neck shape and don't mind the price. They're fantastic guitars.,"Just buy it. It doesn't seem like the S line will get much love from Ibanez in the Prestige and JCustom lineup. If you see one and love it, get it.","People say the same thing about RG guitars from the 80s and 90s. I‚Äôve never played an RG from that era - mine are from the late 2000s to mid 2010s.
I think you will be fine in getting a more modern MIJ one. I believe some of them were made in Korea - since I haven‚Äôt played one of those, I can‚Äôt speak for the quality of them.","I have a made in korea S presige.

JS22 is an entry level lowest tier Jackson, S621 is a budget level middle tier Ibanez, and LTD EC1000 is a top tier LTD. what's the point of your comparison?
if you want a durable guitar, get the new LTD 1000 series with stainless steel frets and fixed bridge.","EC 1000 is an attractive, showy guitar with some beefy tone from the EMGs. It's a solid value for sure. I had one for a few years.
Ibanez S series is quite a nice instrument too.  I have one still.

If you are not picky about tuner branding, Fender Schaller locking tuners are a direct drop-in fit for these. They are a really great upgrade to the cheap stock tuners.","The machine heads should be a standard Ibanez die cast. Pretty sure there won't be any holes drilled in the headstock for them so you will have to take a drill to your guitar. Usually they are fine and most tuning problems result from poorly set up and bad nut.
If you do find the machine heads to be a problem the no brainer standard Ibanez upgrade would be Gotoh SG381-07.",,,

Not knowing anything about what you are playing through I may still be able to help. You need to lose the ground on one component of your rig. Check the amp first for a ground lift switch.

(Eastman memo p. 1-2)  This doesn't in any way logically connect to the idea that the Trump electors who met in those states had any valid legal basis for casting valid electoral votes.  No analysis is done of those states elector certification process, or any other reasoning put forward why those electors are valid.  Looking [at Michigan law for example](
) the electors are clearly determined by the certification of the Governor upon receipt of the results from the State Board of Canvassers.  Under Michigan law, the Trump electors 
If the idea of the Eastman memo is that state law is totally sacrosanct in elector selection, then it is doomed on its own terms, because the legal process of each state contested in the memo clearly selected the Biden electors.
The point in time to challenge that was in state court prior to certification.  Such challenges were brought, and uniformly failed, 
The Eastman memo attempts to claim the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional, however, Congress has broad power to make laws in areas under its jurisdiction, as established in the seminal case of 
  The analysis here is very brief in the Eastman memo, but I think pretty unpersuasive.  
 goes over the history of the 12th amendment and why the claim that the ECA is unconstitutional doesn't hold water.
Eastman proposes three plans by which Pence steals the election.
First, he proposes that 38 EVs worth of  states' legislatures could post-hoc change their votes to be for Trump.  This despite the clear instruction in 
 that ""The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.""  And the fact that 
  Of course, that didn't happen at all, so moving to door number two
Second, he proposes that Pence unilaterally declare the states Trump contested have failed to choose electors, essentially nullifying all votes cast in those states, and decreeing that Trump won once you only count the votes he didn't throw out.  This would completely upend the right of states to choose electors by letting one man just throw them out by fiat.  As elaborated in the Muller piece linked above, this is emphatically 
 what the practice the 12th amendment sought to codify was, and would be a blatant coup d'etat.
Third, he proposes that Pence do the plan from point 2, but instead toss the Presidential election to the House of Representatives under the 12th amendment contingent election process, counting on Republicans holding more states under the insane ""one state one vote"" rule for contingent elections.
Beyond the blatant problems with the document and its obvious support for a coup d'etat, the practical consequences of the Eastman memo being 
 are as scary as it being wrong.  Blatantly throwing out election results like this is the sort of thing which would, justifiably, shake the US Constitution to its core.  If Eastman were right, then the US Constitution is one which allows a blatant dictatorship where all one has to do to keep power is tell the right lies at the right moment.
If Pence stood in the well of the House and attempted to throw out the election results and declare Trump re-elected, it would by far be the greatest constitutional crisis the US has ever faced.  This is the sort of thing that starts civil wars.",I have to say that I felt be it terribly disheartening to see a professor of constitutional law arguing that Pence should help Trump commit a coup simply because partisanship trumps the Constitution,"The Eastman memo attempts to claim the Electoral Count Act is unconstitutional
It's also worth noting that the constitutionality of the ECA may be a moot point, as 
:
Federal law currently requires that the newly elected House and Senate convene in a joint session to count the electoral votes for president on January 6th at 1:00 p.m., although Congress can set a different time and date through law. The two chambers generally enter into this joint session through the passage of a concurrent resolution by both chambers. Importantly, in recent years, this concurrent resolution has often incorporated federal laws relating to the counting of electoral votes by reference. Each has also paraphrased key language on how the joint session should operate from the 1887 Electoral Count Act, the federal law that regulates the process for counting electoral votes.
The language in these concurrent resolutions is important because it may help address a major criticism of the Electoral Count Act: that one Congress cannot constitutionally restrict how future Congresses chooses to handle the electoral vote counting process. According to this view, the conduct of the joint session of Congress at which the count takes place is the product of the procedural rules adopted by Congress, and Article I of the Constitution empowers each chamber to ‚Äúdetermine the rules of its proceedings[.]‚Äù Allowing a past Congress to dictate the rules for future congresses would run contrary to this authority. For this reason, many view the Electoral Count Act as effectively non-binding. Yet by incorporating these rules into the concurrent resolution initiating the joint session, each Congress effectively re-affirms the Electoral Count Act‚Äôs rules as their own and ensures their continued relevance. Of course, if those who view the Electoral Count Act as non-binding are correct, then each new Congress could choose to adopt rules that depart from its requirements. To do so, however, Congress would need to reflect the change in the concurrent resolution or some other instrument. Moreover, for purposes of at least the joint session, this would require majority support in both chambers.","Regarding the electors changing their vote.
This was the only legal way he could've been elected President. Realistically it was also a dream. Those were all Democrats that were selected as electors.
This actually happened in his first election where he gained more electors than Hillary did. I think it was something like 6, so having 38 democrats all changing their votes would not be realistic.
It would be constitutional though. That was actually one of the arguments /for/ the Electoral College."
Presidential Election,"If Republicans use Congress to steal the 2024 Presidential Election, what should Liberals do next?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/q1j8um/if_republicans_use_congress_to_steal_the_2024/,"The following is a copy of the original post to record the post as it was originally written.
Imagine this hypothetical: The date is January 6, 2024. The Democratic presidential candidate has won the popular vote, and the Electoral College by eking out a narrow victory in one or two swing states. Republicans, who control the House and Senate after winning in 2022, have spent the preceding months casting baseless accusations of fraud on the Democratic candidate. When the Senate convenes, despite objections from VP Harris, Republican Senators vote to refuse to recognize electors from the states that gave the Democrat their victory, leading to either the Republican being declared the winner, or the election being thrown to the House where Republicans declare their candidate the winner. When Democrats go to the Supreme Court, the Justices declare the matter outside of their jurisdiction.
Obviously, this is a possibility we should try to avoid happening at any cost. That said, if it does happen, what should liberals and democrats do about it? What would be the proper, proportionate response? What would you do on a personal level if this happened?","That would be a coup.  That cannot be allowed to stand.  We must mobilize in the streets following that: shutdown as many cities as we can. I guess the term ""general strike"" is what we would use.
Democratic and Republican governors and legislatures that accept the rule of law should refuse to work with the sham administration. The legitimate president, as selected by the people, should simply ignore the coup and proceed to take whatever power they actually can as they were dutifully elected to do.  The military should back the democratically elected leader.
If all of that fails, then democracy is dead in the US.  That's an apocalyptic scenario, and I don't know what my response would be.  I sure as shit would not just turn up at work the following Monday and pretend things were normal.","That would be a coup.  That cannot be allowed to stand.  We must mobilize in the streets following that: shutdown as many cities as we can. I guess the term ""general strike"" is what we would use.
I agree that this would lead to ""days of rage"" style protests nationwide",,"If they tried to avoid certifying the Election results and then tried to force a Republican candidate into the Presidency despite both the Popular AND Electoral Vote proclaiming the Democrat candidate the duly elected President, then I suspect that the Armed Forces would fulfill their oath to defend the Constitution and forcibly remove and arrest the recalcitrant Representatives."

Ichika Nito,Ichika Nito plays a digital guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/lyh7qr/ichika_nito_plays_a_digital_guitar/,He's a good player.  I'm more interested in the mechanics. Can he bend a note? Is there pinch harmonic? Any difference in tone between players?  The sounds he made can be made on a normal guitar with pedals.  Can he hit a button to change tunings so he can have multiple tunings in one song?  That thing has potential!,This is a nice review,,"You can bend notes on midi guitars. Natural bends, huge crazy wild ones, or even disable note bending. Pinch harmonics will just register as a higher pitch and trigger a higher synth note (if it even registers). There are pedals for regular guitars that generate synth sounds, but it's different than controlling a synth with a midi guitar. Synth pedals might be better because you wouldn't get false or stuck notes, but you wouldn't have access to the huge library of midi sounds either.
I have a midi guitar setup and kind of regret buying it. There's a reason they're not that common. False notes, notes being stuck on, hard to play clean all the time, novelty wears off. I still find it fun for laying down some blended midi/guitar solo sounds, or to add rhythm keyboard parts to jams... but usually involves a lot of cleaning up and editing bad notes out. And just finding playable sounds out of all the keyboard sounds out there is a pain. A lot of synth sounds just aren't fun to play on guitar. Some work really good.
This short video of a guy testing his midi guitars is similar to my experience, maybe not as bad as mine. ",Pretty cool! Didn't even know this was a thing!

Take that feeling and put it under a microscope.
The trick is you work to develop a light, responsive touch over a period of time. It's playing in that small space between enough pressure to fret the note but not feel heavy; I always think of it as ice skating on the strings. Step 2 is you add a serious amount of compression to your guitar tone, Nito especially.
Playing some of that stuff myself, Mateus Asato too, it probably took me a solid 3-4 months of working on it to where I felt 100% consistent.",Shine the light!,"Also replace your strings

Strat-like single coils Reverb AND A LOOOOOT OF COMPRESSION",I would bet some modelling thing like AxeFX,"Ibanez TM1730M-VWH
The AHM model is an ash body with a white blonde finish. The vintage white model is the one he uses in the video and has an alder body. Can confirm because I own it.
Don't need this guitar to achieve that tone though. He just uses clean tones and I've seen him use a Yamaha THR10 in the past. It does cleans 
 as well as having awesome reverb like you hear in the video. Also can confirm because I own one of these as well.
The pickups in the guitar are the Seymour Duncan Five-Two's, which are probably some of my favorite pickups ever. They'll go in any Stratocaster style guitar, and will sound the same no matter what hunk of wood they're in.
Hope this helps.",

Ichika Nito,Ichika Nito playing a digital guitar,https://www.reddit.com/r/jazzguitar/comments/lxitpf/ichika_nito_playing_a_digital_guitar/,I wonder what the latency is like,"Latency on the Casio DG-20 was really great. The problem with it was everything else.
For starters, it isn't a guitar, it just looks (kind of) like one. Most guitar synthesizers work by converting audio (vibrating strings) to electronic control messages. However detecting pitch takes time, and that leads to latency.
The DG-20 got around that by not bothering with audio. The fretboard is really just a rubber keyboard. It doesn't care that you're pressing down the string, just that you're pressing down something on the fretboard. They strings are switches‚Äîwhen you hit one, it starts playing whatever note you're pressing down on the 
 keyboard. Basically it's a keytar with a really bad triggering mechanism.
And it was really bad. Lots of false notes, lots of missed notes, no velocity sensitivity, polyphony that would drop out at weird times. It's so different from playing a regular guitar that you're better off just learning to play the keyboard.
Of course the sounds are awful but endearing. Fortunately it has MIDI out, so you don't have to sound like a Famicon all the time.
Overall it's tremendously fun but most definitely useless.",,"This is very impressive and I'm not trying to hate, but I don't think it really qualifies as jazz guitar...",hes so hot... boom

Ichika Nito,[Discussion] Fan of Ichika Nito but I‚Äôve always wondered if some his videos are sped up and his latest video only seems to confirm my suspicion. Just wondering on yalls thoughts.,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/lzhwop/discussion_fan_of_ichika_nito_but_ive_always/,"It should be noted that he's also playing a Casio DG-20 there. They aren't played like a normal guitar. The strings are barely under tension. You fret where you want the pitch to be and you just lightly hit the string to trigger the sound. So it very well may be easier for him to play based on that.
But overall, he's a ridiculous player when it comes to extremely quick instagram length videos. He can do as many takes as he wants and practice as long as he wants on the one short video he'll be doing at that time. So I definitely don't think he'd be one to speed the videos up.","Felt like you were gonna get a lot more hate for this... don't think I've ever seen a negative comment about this guy, lol think it's like sacrilege to most people. I don't believe he speeds anything up, he's a very talented and technically proficient player... BUT to me, once you've seen one of his videos, you've basically heard his whole discography imo... not a whole lot of variation in his playing. All sounds the same to me. But again, I'm sure this is sacrilege.","ichika just uploaded a new video, which made me google search ""ichika alwasys sounds the same""  and i saw a comment linking a video, and its the exact same video he just uploaded today but with a difference of 2 years, and yet no one has even noticed its the same song","I agree. He's an amazing player but I couldn't sit through a whole concert of those particular tones and arrangements. With every new video he posts, I keep hoping that he'll play something more different but he always defaults to fingerstyle, chords above the 12th fret, tapping, and harmonics. On paper, that sounds impressive but it's very repetitive. What I find the most amusing is that he had those series of videos where he would play in bizarre tunings but he still somehow found a way for those to all sound the same.
EDIT: Also, what is it about his guitar tone that makes it so grating on the ears? It sounds like it's compressed to within an inch of it's life.","I do feel like a lot of his songs are similar to ""I miss you"". He posted one recently that the melody kept leading to that riff but then he'd play a different chord instead.
But his skills are undeniable, he is a guitar virtuoso"

Presidential Election,It Shouldn't Be This Easy to Overthrow the American Republic | CNN got hold of a Trump lawyer's memo that describes a precise six-point plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/psq0hb/it_shouldnt_be_this_easy_to_overthrow_the/,"As a reminder, this subreddit

VP Pence, presiding over the joint session (or Senate Pro Tempore Grassley, if Pence recuses himself), begins to open and count the ballots, starting with Alabama (without conceding that the procedure, specified by the Electoral Count Act, of going through the States alphabetically is required).
When he gets to Arizona, he announces that he has multiple slates of electors, and so is going to defer decision on that until finishing the other States. This would be the first break with the procedure set out in the Act.
At the end, he announces that because of the ongoing disputes in the 7 States, there are no electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those States.  That means the total number of ‚Äúelectors appointed‚Äù ‚Äì the language of the 12th Amendment -- is 454.  This reading of the 12th Amendment has also been advanced by Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe (here).  A ‚Äúmajority of the electors appointed‚Äù would therefore be 228.  There are at this point 232 votes for Trump, 222 votes for Biden.  Pence then gavels President Trump as re-elected.
Howls, of course, from the Democrats, who now claim, contrary to Tribe‚Äôs prior position, that 270 is required.  So Pence says, fine.  Pursuant to the 12th
Amendment, no candidate has achieved the necessary majority.  That sends the matter to the House, where the ‚Äúthe votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote . . . .‚Äù  Republicans currently control 26 of the state delegations, the bare majority needed to win that vote.
President Trump is re-elected there as well.
One last piece.  Assuming the Electoral Count Act process is followed and, upon getting the objections to the Arizona slates, the two houses break into their separate chambers, we should not allow the Electoral Count Act constraint on debate to control.  That would mean that a prior legislature was determining the rules of the present one ‚Äî a constitutional no-no (as Tribe has forcefully argued).  So someone ‚Äì Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, etc. ‚Äì should demand normal rules (which includes the filibuster).  That creates a stalemate that would give the state legislatures more time to weigh in to formally support the alternate slate of electors, if they had not already done so.
The main thing here is that Pence should do this without asking for permission ‚Äì either from a vote of the joint session or from the Court.  Let the other side challenge his actions in court, where Tribe (who in 2001 conceded the President of the Senate might be in charge of counting the votes) and others who would press a lawsuit would have their past position -- that these are non-justiciable political questions ‚Äì thrown back at them, to get the lawsuit dismissed.  The fact is that the Constitution assigns this power to the Vice President as the ultimate arbiter.  We should take all of our actions with that in mind.

 pdf","This strategy is familiar because people were arguing similar tactics on Reddit prior to January 6th. There were posts in 
 before it got banned making similar claims, just with less legal background. They kept asserting that if you could claim electors are disputed, you simply wouldn't count any electors rather than resolve the disputes, which is essentially the first line from point 3 in the memo.",,Seriously what the fuck

If you want to get better at tapping, start tapping. If you want to get better at sweeping, start sweeping. There are a lot of resources on this sort of stuff and I'm sure you can find them.
I think the most important thing about Ichika's playing is that he knows his musical theory front to back. He knows where every single note is on the neck and how to combine and apply them at any time, in advance or on the fly, and can do the same when asked to switch into radically different tunings.
To practice this stuff, look into jazz. Practice finding notes and combining them in weird and interesting ways, how to create and resolve tension, etc. Then do it quicker and quicker until your improvisational skills make you look like a wizard.","Great information man! OP this is the information you need.
The one thing I would add is to always experiment. Ichika‚Äôs style is so singular in how he combines so many different elements of guitar technique. He would not sound like ‚ÄúIchika‚Äù unless he experimented with the instrument itself, which is honestly the hardest part. You can train yourself to tap, to sweep, to play fast. But having your own style is a very hard thing to do that only practice and experimentation will yield.",Sorry for a bit of a delayed response but thanks so much for this. Really helpful!,,"I think another thing with him is that he writes.  It‚Äôs possible that writing gives him an advantage over someone who just learns others‚Äô work.
What I like to do is take a bite-sized piece, like doing right hand tap whole tone ascending slides, and apply that to a small original piece.  I‚Äôll also try to apply the technique around the neck and in all keys.  I‚Äôm no Ichika (yet) but I find that these approaches give me good results."

Der fake Fisch ist aus Reis, Weizen und H√ºlsenfr√ºchten. Als Allergen ist Gluten angegeben. Bei den Visch and Chips au√üerdem noch Soja, aber nur, wenn man den Waffelbecher, in dem die So√üe ist, mitisst.
Preislich lag das Baguette bei um die 3‚Ç¨ und die Visch and Chips in der gro√üen Gr√∂√üe bei um die 5‚Ç¨.
Bei der Remoulade bin ich mir nicht ganz sicher, ob sie jetzt vegan oder nur vegetarisch ist. Laut Google gab es wohl bei Nordsee erst keine vegane Remoulade, aber jetzt schon. F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich als Vegetarier war es nicht so wichtig, also hab ich leider nicht extra nachgefragt.
Hab das Essen mit meiner Freundin gegessen, also schreib ich ihre Meinung auch mal mit dazu.
Meine Freundin fand die Fisch Nuggets zwar lecker, aber fand, dass es nicht wirklich wie Fisch schmeckt. Mit Remoulade k√∂nne man aber fast denken, dass es wirklich Fisch sei, aber immer noch weniger fischig als die SoFish Burger. Sie meinte die Textur w√§re gut.
Sie w√ºrde die wieder kaufen.
Ich fand die Fisch Nuggets auch lecker. Ohne Remoulade nicht super fischig, aber die Remoulade macht echt einen gro√üen Unterschied. Mit Remoulade fand ich es sehr lecker. Fischig, aber nicht zu stark. Die Textur mag ich auch. Passt gut zu den Pommes.
Die Visch and Chips w√ºrde ich mir auch wieder kaufen.
4/5 mit Remoulade, 3/5 ohne Remoulade
Meine Freundin fand, dass die Sorte Brot nicht gut zum Backvisch passt, es war so ein Roggenbrot und etwas zu s√§uerlich, was den Visch etwas overpowered habe. Mit Salat sei es besser, aber da war nur auf der H√§lfte des Baguettes so ein traurig welkes Salatblatt und kaum So√üe (wir haben uns das Baguette geteilt, und ich hab den ganzen Salat erwischt und sie die Remoulade).
Mit extra Remoulade drauf fand sie es okay, aber immer noch etwas schwammig. Die Textur des Backvisch fand sie hier n√§her an Reis als bei den Nuggets.
Ich mochte die Textur vom Fisch hier nicht so gerne. Sehr wie panierter Reis! Ich wei√ü nicht, ob der Backvisch tats√§chlich anders ist, als der Visch von den Visch and Chips oder nur weniger lange frittiert wurde oder so, aber irgendwie war er deutlich weniger √ºberzeugend und die Textur war deutlich schlechter.
Mit Remoulade auch hier okay, aber w√ºrde es mir nicht nochmal kaufen.
3/5 mit Remoulade, 2/5 ohne Remoulade
Habt ihr die Nordsee Plantbased ""Visch"" Sachen probiert? Wenn ja, wie hat es euch geschmeckt?","Bin letztens in der Stadt zuf√§llig am Nordsee vorbeigelaufen und habe dann direkt erst mal das Baguette probiert. Ich teile da deine Meinung. Textur fand ich in Ordnung, insgesamt aber eher trocken. Mehr Remoulade h√§tte nicht schaden k√∂nnen. Auch das obligatorische welke Salatblatt half da nicht viel. Trotzdem fand ich es insgesamt ganz okay, allerdings nichts f√ºr den gro√üen Hunger. War etwas von der √ºberschaubaren Gr√∂√üe √ºberrascht. Toll finde ich aber generell, dass auch Fisch-Ersatzprodukte langsam ein Ding werden.",,"""4/5 mit Remoulade, 3/5 ohne Remoulade. "" - Ich, bei jedem Essen",

Thanks for your input!,"I‚Äôll give my spin on this, it‚Äôs not accepted by everyone, but it makes the most sense to me. ‚ÄúPlant based‚Äù refers to a diet that abstains from food products made by and from animals. ‚ÄúVeganism‚Äù refers to a social movement that opposes the human practice of using sentient non-human animals as resources, and seeks to develop a future where humans can prosper without using other animals as resources at all. So a vegan is, first and foremost, someone who desires the success of veganism, and who contributes towards its success (ideally in organized coordination with an ever-growing group of others).",Very cool spin. Thanks for sharing! Enjoyed reading that.,"Here's how I explain it to people: Vegan means avoiding products derived from (or tested on) animals for the sake of the animals. Animals include land animals, birds, fish, and insects (bees). Veganism goes beyond food, and includes clothing, cosmetics, medications etc. Veganism will involve not buying shoes, cosmetics, pills etc that have animal products like leather or gelatin, or are tested on animals. Some vegans will also avoid products such as palm oil that are associated with habitat destruction or harm to specific animal species.
Plant-based means that you base your diet on food coming from plants. This might be done for a range of motivations - animal welfare, the environment, personal health are common ones. So all vegans eat a plant-based diet, but a vegan lifestyle includes more. Lots of vegans will object calling yourself vegan when you don't follow the full lifestyle and do it for the animals.  They'll say you don't get the ethics of it.
In practice, the two diets will both be plant-based, unless the ""plant-based"" person decides that ""plant-based"" means ""mostly plants"" rather than ""made from plants""."

If you want efficient markets we have to solve this problem.  We have to engineer solutions out of billionaire shareholders.
edit: to preempt the below comment:
I'm not talking about Efficient Market Theory as it relates the share price discovery, I'm talking about the nearly religious notion that Capitalism produces efficient allocation of resources and that if we want efficient allocation of resources we should solve a massive inefficiency in the system","I think this is one of those ones which people everywhere get confused.
When economists talk about markets being efficient, it basically just means that in an efficient market, the price of a good will reflect available information about the value of the assets. Changes in that information will result in an instant change in the valuation and consequently the price of stuff like food or stocks or what have you.
You can argue all day about being not being perfect agents and information not being perfectly disseminated, but that's irrelevant to how many people try and misuse the term.
Market efficiency is very specifically not about the efficiency of a market as a means for distribution of goods. It's information efficiency, not material efficiency.
People trying to push for capitalism/market economies will claim that markets are an efficient way to distribute goods, which is, at best, a misunderstanding of the system, at worse, blatant misrepresentation of economics.
Whether or not they are good at distribution of goods is irrelevant to market efficiency, and as you note, we can see real world examples where you could improve on the reality of a market.",,Hmm. Are you trying to say something like this‚Ä¶? Overly concentrated wealth is a distribution problem,

Chip Shortage,Tesla & Chip Shortage,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semiconductors/comments/q1xtv2/tesla_chip_shortage/,"Automotive-grade semiconductors have to be very reliable and durable, have higher temperature tolerance, etc. If you do your own, hopefully you control well the switching process but the overhead of having good quality devices takes a lot of money, time and experience. Depending on the company, it can take something like at least 12 months until you have an actual product.
You also mention ""a company with the right software skills"", semiconductors require proper chip design engineering to begin with, only then a specialised embedded software team of engineers, testers, etc.","Typically you'd be able to go to a single chip manufacturer, test a microcontroller and order a shit ton of them.
Here Tesla, is probably scrambling to get a bunch of different microcontrollers from different manufacturers just because no one supplier is going to have the fab capacity negotiated and operational to supply the full order.
This means that Tesla now need to test 19 different chips for a high-standard of reliability in high temperature environments. They also need to ensure that their firmware code works across all of these chips.
Typically Automotive companies are much more risk adverse to new technologies than consumer electronics companies. Example: Toyota might still be using 130nm CMOS technology while the rest of the world is working on 10nm, simply for reliability reasons. Also, Power electronics ususally need high drive capacities, so they tend to not benifit as much from technology scaling.","Interesting, thanks for that. So the MCs Tesla is buying could either be 1) so specific to the car that they are automotive grade anyway (like, who would produce an airbag restraint module that's not autograde) or 2) non auto-specific and more general purpose. In case of 1) the chips would still have to be programmed in a way that it doesn't matter if a car has a MC from supplier A or supplier B. If 2) an additional problem could be that the chip isn't durable enough to last >10 years.","The major issue here is reliability. There are insane requirements to qualify a new part for automotive use. Check out IATF to learn more. Simply qualifying a new semiconductor fab to manufacture chips for the auto sector can take 1-2 years not including the actual R&D to design the part, and actually getting to mature yields in the factory.
There are a lot of people going all-in on this process right now. Whoever gets there first wins huge money because once an auto manufacturer commits to a primary supplier their own qualification process for a new supplier is a nightmare too.",Yep this what I do too- qualify new devices.

They sold off recently along with MU because they also supply DRAM equipment and there is suspicion in the industry DRAM cycle peaked.

If auto makers use less steel then CLF could make MORE money as they could sell steel at higher prices on the spot market
Auto makers could also continue to buy the contracted steel and then just store it anyway? They‚Äôve negotiated contracts lower than the current spot price so it may be better to take delivery of their steel and store it, rather than risk paying more at a later date","Thats limited. JIT has created stampers and the like and you can't have 100,000 doors sitting around. Thats when damage happens. Its also dangerous because who knows what will be reopened and what stays closed.

But this won't last forever. If overall steel demand goes lower AND automakers can't get enough chips, then it might hurt CLF as they possibly won't be able to offload their entire production in the spot market.

Solar Energy,Saskatoon sees bright future in solar energy,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/ox7f39/saskatoon_sees_bright_future_in_solar_energy/,Net metering means they own %30 of what you produce and you're still paying base fees of $300yr. So now future housing will be have to bear the cost of maintaining their own solar system while still paying the full cost of maintaining the grid? The incentive isn't there today so let's just make it mandatory I guess..,"Any excess power you use and provide back onto the power grid is priced at 7.5 cents per kWh. That‚Äôs the average cost that SaskPower pays for its power.Keep in mind that when you‚Äôre using the power your system produces, you‚Äôre using it at your standard retail rate (what we typically charge customers for power -- e.g. for residential customers it would be around 14 cents). It‚Äôs only when you‚Äôre generating extra power beyond what you can use that it‚Äôs priced at 7.5 cents.You can carry forward any unused credits on your bill until you move or close your account. Please note: the credits are non-refundable and will not be paid out.
Major public utility providers are not creating an inviting climate for net metering due to the monopoly they hold.  It does not make sense for them to incentivize this.  It's greed and oversight, for instance any excess power generated could be sold to other utility providers in times of crisis (think Texas this past winter).  There have been many cyberattacks on industrial infrastructure recently as well.  Between climate disaster and hacking, there will be plenty of future opportunities to sell power at premium, it will be a total facepalm by Canadian public utility providers who have a robust grid, if they are not prepared.
In B.C. where I live, BC Hydro touts over 90% of sources already comes from renewable energy and do not incentivize solar at all.  It seems like a great place to start with the remaining 10% incentivized to install (private) renewable power infrastructure with reserves for a power generation crisis from nearby distribution grids.

Based upon our experiences, on average, Antminer S9s actually draw about 1,500 watts.

Now, on the energy providing side:

Assuming you'll have about 4 hours of peak sun hours, that means you'll get 425 W * 4 h = 1700 Wh, or 1.7 kWh per solar panel per day.

Regarding the quotes within the article itself, these too are fabricated and did not come from Charlie Lee, the creator of Litecoin and Managing Director of the Litecoin Foundation.
Several media outlets, including Reuters, did cover the story first, and in response one of our social media team members was a little too eager and shared the story from the Litecoin Twitter account. This was quickly deleted and we have take steps to correct future issues. Our marketing team has been responding to inquiries that this is indeed false.",As if LTC needed a nail in the coffin. Poor Litecoin was at one point considered the silver to BTC's gold but is now not even bronze,,"LTC gets a black eye because some scammer tried to rig the system to boost their profits.  That's a shame, actually.  I dont have any LTC, but that doesn't mean that I don't hate to see them have to go on damage control.  It doesn't help that people who aren't involved in crypto might be gullible enough to believe that this is how our community works.  I'd like to hope that this incident is a rare exception.  Really hope.",They should ask Charlie about the wash trading he did with Litecoin as an employee of Coinbase. Apparently he accounted for almost all of the early litecoin volume on the exchange while he worked there. After pumping the price and selling ‚ÄúHodl Litecoin‚Äù shirts he dumped his entire bag on his followers. Helluva guy.

!","First off, I recommend the UW course on Calling Bullshit (free syllabus & reading material) and the Crash Course on Media Literacy.
UW:
CC:
In a nutshell, here's what I do
First off, is it in a paper of record? Those are generally highly accurate and fact-based, and include the LA Times, New York Times, WSJ, and Washington Post.
Does it sound too good to be true? If so, it probably is.
Is only one outlet reporting it? Have you ever heard of them before? (Example: the Washington Examiner is a highly biased & low fact outlet that might be mistaken for the Washington Post, a paper of record.)
What are other major news outlets saying about the same story?
Who is the author? This is especially relevant for Op-Eds, which typically don't require fact-checking and will have a variety of motives for their authors. Esp. look at authors who may have financial or political motivations (probably most of them.)
Does the article use loaded language or appeal to emotion? This would include dog-whistle signals.

Does the story or argument use logical fallacies?
How does the source compare with others on bias and fact-orientation? Use a tool like this:
 Try to stay toward the center & top. If you use sources that are towards the outsides, be aware of their bias and how they might spin the story. Avoid completely those sources that are fact avoidant. Infowars & Epoch Times come to mind here.
How does the story align with what you already know of the topic? (esp. if you have studied the topic) We tend to trust sources more if we don't know anything about the topic, even though they may be even more biased or fact-elusive, because we might not catch it.)
If the story is science related, are there peer reviewed articles that back it up? Key examples here would be like the discredited study linking vaccines to autism, or the the vast majority of climate scientists signing on to the IPCC reports.
Hope this helps.

Chip Shortage,Chip shortage: Toyota to cut global production by 40%,https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/p7jc63/chip_shortage_toyota_to_cut_global_production_by/,Taliban in shambles,"So the supply of semiconductors is low because the demand is so high, so when/how will the supply increase to meet demand?",,,"The supply chain for semiconductor is very wide and very deep. There are hundreds of companies, big and small, that make machines, chemicals, substrates, pellicles, light sources, masks, test equipment, etc. Most of those require huge capital investment to produce, so suppliers want to ensure consistent order volume to achieve high utilization of their capital investment to keep costs down. This means large orders, long lead times, and restrictive purchase agreements so suppliers can shuffle orders around to keep the queue full. There's not a lot of wiggle room to increase (or, often, decrease) production.
Second, many of the important components aren't interchangeable. There is a DRAM and NAND commodity market, but for many other components the buyers are limited. Anybody buying large quantities has a purchase agreement so they're not participating in the market to the same extent.
So supply is inflexible and demand is inflexible and the whole industry is built around stabilizing production. The big buyers have prices locked in, or the sales guys don't want to burn the relationship by asking for too much. The distributors that sell to smaller buyers don't have a good idea what the demand will be for a specific part, and they don't have the infrastructure for dynamic pricing or real-time markets. There are some scalpers (unauthorized distributors) that take a bigger risk and do more work to try to make a bigger profit selling fewer parts. The big distributors are just happy to have the volume.
So the prices go up a little, and lead times go out to 60 weeks, and there's not much that can be done about it."

As long as I‚Äôm w healthy, primarily Whole Foods, i look at eating out as splurging.
With that being said, I think you made great suggestions.
My first idea is savory sweet muffins. I can eat those any time of day!!! Or a fruit baked oatmeal","Deep-frying, for example, is a no-no, but baking eggplant without oil is hardly feasible and leads to unconvincing results.
Frankly I have to agree. I mean, I bake my aubergine/eggplant without oil and it's perfectly fine for a homemade dinner. But is it a meal I would pay for in a restaurant? Maybe not.
I guess it depends on what kind of place it is. For a place where I grab lunch most days, I prioritise health over flavour. But in a restaurant where I go once a month or whatever as a treat..... I still wouldn't want to eat completely unhealthy crap, but I am happy to make some compromises if it enhances the flavour. Because in that case I don't just go to feed myself (like for lunch) but I go to have a great time and taste food that's better than what I make at home.
And honestly, that restaurant already sounds like a great place that uses whole foods and only uses just as much oil as is needed to enhance the flavour to a level where it's restaurant worthy.
Suggesting to make dressings oil free (or at least offer one or two oil free options) is a good idea though because often it doesn't even make much of a difference to flavour but it just never occurs to lots of people, even chefs.
And depending on what they use the chocolate spread for, maybe a fruit compote might be a viable alternative that could be suggested. Or something based on dates.",,"Do you think they weren't genuine? Their meals seem relatively healthy and with good ingredients. So it doesnt seem too far-fetched to me that they would like to offer healthy/healthier products but they also want to appeal to the widest possible audience and not just super health-conscious people like WFPB eaters like us.

I'm not saying docs are omniscients but if there really was something awfully wrong they should've noticed.","I'm not 'worried', I am a bit surprised if it came off that way - I'm really just curious as to what effect this has (and if I was alone with it).
I do eat rather varied and consume maybe a bit too many almonds, so I think I'm good on the nuts.
I'm also not saying I'm seeing undigested food every single time (although fairly often), but certain foods (or at least part of them) will always come out undigested.","Six times a day is very much, I go like 2 or sometimes 3 times a day. I never see any indigested parts. I'm not a doctor or anything but I've heard that often people don't chew very well. Maybe you could try it for a day to chew your food more and see what happens. It can make it easier for your stomach to break down smaller pieces.","I think you're right some of it has to do with chewing - I mean some of the chunks are so big they obviously haven't been chewed.
I'm curious as to how much chewing is 'normal', or 'well'. I haven't really thought of how I chew.
Edit: I go 3-6 times on a normal day, there are days where I only go once, or 9 times - and they're not THAT rare. I think it very much has to do with diet or chewing.","I shit at least 4 times a day, and have also noticed that food goes through a lot faster, and stuff like blueberry skins are often undigested. I have IBS, so YMMV. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly an issue, and agree that it‚Äôs probably from large amounts of fiber."

Plantbased,does somebody have any experience with healing from hyperhidrosis because of a plantbased diet?,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/hbmzg8/does_somebody_have_any_experience_with_healing/,"I have neither been medically diagnosed nor looked into any scientific explanation to confirm my experience. I can say though that for over a decade I have experienced the symptoms and tried multiple otc anti-perspirants with Certain Dri being the most effective. For me it was always my armpits. Didn't matter the weather, I would look like I had just finished a hard run after a few hours. Undershirts, extra clothes in the trunk, bathroom trips to blot, and burns from over application of the antiperspirants were a daily experience. Hoodie season couldn't come soon enough just so I could hide the pit sweat and stains.
April of 2019 I began eating wfpb and sometime around that fall I just began noticing I wasn't sweating as much any longer. I stopped using my antiperspirants and wasn't needing to change shirts throughout the day. It's been over a year now and I still don't have any of the chronic sweat.
I occasionally do fall off the wagon for a meal or two  and notice that it quickly begins to creep back. Dairy seems to be my trigger based on my own observations but it goes away again in a day or two. I know I'm only one anecdote but I wish you the best. Among the myriad other health benefits that wfpb can bring this has been the most impactful to my quality of life.","I have hyperhidrosis on my hands and feet. I went to the dermatologist ready to get Botox shots, but they recommended I try Robinul first. It's a pill that you can take orally and it has solved all of my sweaty problems. I highly, highly recommend it. It has really improved my quality of life and I never, ever miss a dose it's that important to me.","I don't have hyperhidrosis diagnosed but I sweat like crazy and everywhere except on my hands. To be honest, I have been vegan for 8 years now and it never changed. In humid summers I sometimes have to shower three times a day. Even when I work out I still sweat profusely - looking like I washed my hair and slipping in my own sweat. So sorry actually not. But please tell me if you find something.","really sad to hear that :( must be a real struggle.. i am trying to cut out bread and granulated sugar now. it is maybe a long process, but i hope for the best! i heard that gluten are vegan, but not the healthiest food. and its worth trying.. good luck!!!",
Plantbased,Tips for plantbased cheese,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/gp9fl3/tips_for_plantbased_cheese/,"I also find plant based ‚Äúcheese‚Äù to be yucky. I just steer away from the concept of cheese.  Frex, I make my pizza with sauce and veggie topping, no pretension of cheese.  My kid is making tomato-tuna melts for dinner, I‚Äôll have a bruschetta with tomato and probably mashed chickpeas.
Usually what I want from the cheese is the salt. So for me it‚Äôs better to just salt the beans or add salty pickled banana peppers than cheese substitute. Olives on my pizza provide the saltiness that used to come from cheese.  So much good whole plant food to focus on instead.
Ymmv.","Yeah, I get that! And often that would probably work for me as well.

Plantbased,Vegan/Plantbased?,https://www.reddit.com/r/75HARD/comments/hzlayq/veganplantbased/,"I also followed the Daily Dozen when I went vegan and base quite a bit of my nutritional choices around Dr. Greger's advice, website, and book. I have been plant based for almost 3 years now and while I have not completed this challenge I can say that I never have a lack out of energy and I am in my 40s (M). There are days where I even add a workout at night just to burn some energy. (I could barely get through one workout at a high effort before going vegan).
My workouts consist of a fasted outside jog or bike ride in the mornings before work. I try to get out of my neighborhood when I can to do these and hit a trail. Watching the sunrise every morning really helps too.
For weight training I currently run a Push/Pull/Legs 6 day split with as heavy weights as I can lift. On the 7th day, and sometimes instead of jogging/biking in the mornings, I will do yoga, tai chi, or foam roller stretches/exercises just to change it up and not burn out. Plus, I am older and my body needs the lighter work load days.
Cheers on going on vegan and pushing yourself harder with this challenge!","Thank you for the fantastic advice. I am also doing a  fasted morning workout and a 6 day split at night. My only hope is that i can maintain my routine once I get back into dance classes and rehearsals, since it will be the most I‚Äôve used my body since going vegan. I have loads of energy right now so I‚Äôm glad to know it‚Äôs as sustainable as it feels right now!","There are studies done that athletes (cycling , power lifters, runners, football players) can all eat a vegan diet and still have enough strength and energy if not more to do what they do at a high level. My advice is to pick out workouts that you enjoy and that challenge you a little bit . ( game changers on Netflix is üí£)","Just make sure you get enough protein, honestly. I‚Äôm plant-based (vegan like 50% of the time), and when I upped my exercise, I just added a vegan protein shake and that nipped any energy issues in the bud. Make sure to sleep also! As long as your diet is clean and you‚Äôre eating enough protein, you should be just fine. For myself, my exercise is a shit ton of walking and also HIIT 5 times a week. I regularly do yoga as well, especially on rest days. My husband eats the same as me, is 49M, and eats a bigger protein shake and a few hundred more calories to fuel his weight lifting (Strong Lifts 5x5), and runs 3-5 miles 3 times per week in the AM. Good luck!","I made it 26 days and hurt my back at work, and had to pause per doctor recommendation. But I am vegan, and did those 26 days super clean and plant based. I avoided oil and processed vegan things like the meats. Most days I barely made it to 1500 calories without feeling super full. Protein shake with oat milk and berries for breakfast. Usually a large salad for lunch with chickpeas or tofu and a ton of veggies. And a curry or bean and rice dish for dinner. I had a ton of energy and slept like a baby. Usually i rode my bike in the AM and lifted weights in the afternoon. If I worked ( I do 3-12 hr shifts a week) I lifted in the AM and usually walked in the evening. When my body felt like it needed a break, I did yoga or some stretching videos as a workout. I use Cronometer to track macros and micronutrients and have since going vegan. Good luck!"

Are you seeing any real savings?",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ppc4fd/people_of_reddit_who_switched_your_home_to_solar/,"I haven't done this but have looked into it before. The savings and being worth it is a long term thing. Converting to solar isn't a cheap thing to do. The money you save on your energy bill at the beginning pretty much all goes to paying the system off. The only real ways that this gets offset sooner is if your state gives incentives for converting to solar (which I think a lot do) or if you are collecting more energy than you actually use and can sell it back to the electric companies. Which is always an option but usually takes installing bigger systems than you even need. So it's like a double edged sword.
There's also the fact that unless you install converters you'll need to buy appliances that are compatible with the type of current (DC) that solar produce. These appliances can be more expensive though I think with the movements like tiny homes and off grid living there are companies making more affordable appliances that are compatible with this type of electrical current.
If you are thinking about doing this absolutely do your research first. Don't let it scare you away if you really want to do it. I still love the idea of it but it's definitely not something I expect to be able to do soon. But then again I'm still renting so I wouldn't even be able to do it until I bought a house anyways lol",I really really appreciate your input. You have brought up some good points.

Though this is less because he wasn't shown the sun and more because the military clearly didn't give him too many meals to put on a considerable amount of fat nor develop any muscle. I'm not sure he was really malnourished or had a stunted develop + an exaggerated head.
Otherwise, in a normal environment he'd develop like a normal human would if say he was raised under a red son. He might still be physically fitter on earth due to the lower gravity and less harsh conditions(not that Krypton by his time was still as harsh but genetically his body is still built for it).",,I‚Äôd argue that was more due to red light. The question stipulates him being in a room with no light.

Squid Game,"IMHO The ""Worst"" Part of Squid Game",https://www.reddit.com/r/squidgame/comments/q19iva/imho_the_worst_part_of_squid_game/,"The glass game can somewhat be considered a game of hopscotch, I guess. But I agree that it would've been nice if it was actually based on a real game
There are a couple games I can think of where the earlier you go, the better your chances are
I think the rules were clear. Just step on the glass to make it through. At this point I feel like the players are smart enough to know that if hey 'cheat' by walking on the support beams they'll be shot
Well only one guy left bc he was horny. The others watching from afar with their binoculars looked similar to the wealthy attending an opera
Yeah, I'm curious what would've happened if nobody made it across. Maybe the guards would start shooting the front runners who are purposely holding up the game?
I originally thought Jang Deok-su (The douchey gangster) was gonna make it to the finale. But I guess the buildup of him as the big bad was just a misdirect, since the show wanted to end the games on Gi-hun and Sang-woo's
I agree that Sae-Byeok's injury was really unfair. But I don't necessarily think it's from poor design. I feel like it was intentional for some of the survivors to potentially get wounded","Hmm. I'm having trouble understanding what game(s) you're thinking of in Point 2. Almost all of them are simultaneous starts, except for tug-of-war. (And midnight stabby time)
On Point 5: Sure, they have a good reason to guess that they'd be shot. But Mr. Math teacher knew that shenanigans were his only hope, just like Korean Bernie Madhoff did in Round 4.

Squid Game,"Squid Game subtitles 'change meaning' of Netflix show - 'Squid Game's ""botched"" subtitles have changed the show's meaning for English-speaking viewers, some Korean-speaking fans say.'",https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/q16hd7/squid_game_subtitles_change_meaning_of_netflix/,"The article clears this up in the final paragraphs, but I wish they'd open with it instead because the explanation is easy to miss‚Ä¶
The ""bad translations"" mentioned in the article (and picked apart in the original TikTok) are from the ""English CC"" (Closed Captions) subtitle option. The English Closed Captions are essentially a transcription of the English dub + audio cues such as [playful music], [grunts], etc. They're meant to be used with the English dub, for viewers who prefer the English dub but can't hear too well or have auditory processing issues.
The dub translation is a much looser translation because the actors have to match audio duration and lip movements (syllables) when dubbing -- this is a necessary compromise, or you'll end up with unnatural voice acting such as ""heyhow'sitgoinghaven't (pause) seenyouin (pause) ages"" and ""Oh (long pause) yeahit's (pause) beentoolong. How (pause) haveyoubeen?"" That, and seeing lips continue to move when the line has ended, or spooky disembodied voices when the actors have clearly stopped talking, can really take you out of a show.
To put it simply, this ""the Squid Game subtitles are bad / don't match the audio"" controversy happened because viewers watching with the original Korean audio are getting the Closed Captions meant for the English dub by default, while viewers watching the English dub are getting the subtitles meant for the Korean audio. It's a subtitle-pairing bug that appears to have affected most (but not all) of the viewers watching Squid Game. Instead of ""Squid Game subtitles 'change meaning' of Netflix show,"" a much more honest headline would be ""Netflix subtitle-pairing error leads to much confusion over Squid Game subtitles"" -- but I guess that isn't really news worthy‚Ä¶",This is why when the Frontman was speaking English they melt leaving out the sirs.,,"Okay so my question-- how do you select the closed caption track, rather than the subtitles?
AFAIK Netflix doesn't usually seem to have options for this...",

Squid Game,God bless Squid Game üòá,https://www.reddit.com/r/squidgame/comments/pwjyum/god_bless_squid_game/,"If not already, you should definitely watch other Korean shows/movies, especially horror!
Here's the list I've been sharing to others. Mostly horror/thrill with some sweet and artistic:
 - Intense series about monsters and humans trying to survive. Warning: Excessive amount of blood and a lot of gore, but I promise you'll get attached to the characters like for Squid Game.
 - Zombies set in old Korean era.
 - Dark side of Korean military and how it affects the mental health of Korean men.
 - This is a slow, deep drama, no thrill & no horror. About a moody, loner girl (who‚Äôs like Sae Byeok) who comes from nothing and later bonds with a manager she works for.
 - Episodic show featuring the same actress as My Mister. Plot for each episode is fantasy like, simple and artistic.
--------
 - The ultimate film about the rich and poor done extremely tastefully.
 - Father boards the train with his daughter only to fight for their lives due to zombies.
 - Two swindlers enter a rich heiress home to seduce her and steal her wealth. Only for their plan to not go as planned. Very artistic and unique story.
 - Man is kidnapped and kept in a single room for years and he finally gets released only to go on a rage trying to find his captor.
 - A beautiful woman in prison makes friends with everyone until she's released from jail and we find out all of her true intentions.
 - Tragic story of a father who tries to find his daughter's killer and a poor couple who tries to find donor for the boyfriend's dying sister.
 - A girl lives with her nice, loving family only to come across intruders who completely upend her life.
 - A tough girl (like SaeByeok) is raised and lives with loan sharks.
 - An intense, nonstop thriller. A cop commits murder and goes through all lengths to hide it. But someone knows and someone is out to get him and is messing with his head.
 - Zombies amongst political chaos during dynasty era.
 - Movie prequel to Kingdom series. Anshin, a girl, is faced with difficulties as unknown monster start ravaging the lands.
 - A young man is found stuck in his apartment as zombies take over.
 - A Catholic priest becomes a vampire and gets involved with a complicated family.
 - Fun and thrilling comedy of a group of cops who try to stop the almighty and ruthless rich guy.
 - Set in the dynasty era A poor man who can predict personalities and futures by examining peoples faces is ordered by the King's right hand man to use his skills to weed out his enemies.
 - Set in dynasty era. A king hires a jester that looks exactly like him to be in his place due to his fear of poisoning and betrayal.
 - Set in dynasty era. A strict, filial king has difficulty with his artistic and loose son. Based on true story.
 -This is a sweet, cute film. A man wakes up to be a different person every single day and he tries to find love despite this difficulty.
 - A foolish, small drug dealer gets involved with the big dogs only to become an unstoppable drug king.
 - A girl picks up the phone only to discover another girl her age living from another time. But the friendship is not what it seems.
 - A classic horror story in the countryside. A cop visits a small, rural town to investigate the mysterious killings and illnesses.
 - Featuring Squid Game's Front Man! A cop hunts down and messes with his wife's serial killer and continues a wild ride of catch and release.
 - More of a silly film for children/family setting, but it has a beautiful, deep lesson to be learned. A girl and her grandpa in the countryside is assigned to raise a genetically modified pig which they name Okja.","Sweet Home is the GOAT omg, Parasite was amazing but slightly overhyped in my opinion. I watched Kingdom season 1 and like the first episode of season 2 but that‚Äôs about it, is it worth finishing do you think? Also Park Chan Wooks vengeance trilogy is peak fiction, Oldboy being one of my favourite films",,"Not going to lie, Korea has been killing it in horro/suspense movies on netflix.","Plus the rest of Bong Joon Ho‚Äôs films.

Plantbased,I wanted to share my video about my plantbased journey. Best decision I ever made. Can you still be spiritual and eat meat? What are your thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/k9n33y/i_wanted_to_share_my_video_about_my_plantbased/,"Well according to the book Oashpe you strive to be light which requires a vegan life style in order to actually be able to fully immerse your soul in the next stages of your journey after death. Only book I‚Äôve come across to say that... the Bible mentions nothing of our oneness with the universe including the animals and plants that live in it too
Edit: Also just a thought if a chicken can make an egg without procreating would an egg technically be vegetarian? No harm to the chicken. Everything on this earth has been wonderfully created to work together in some form or fashion","Personally I believe you can still eat meat and be spiritual as long as you are mindful of what you eat and how you eat it. The way society consumes meat and meat-based products are not mindful in the way they are processed and consumed. They see animals as a resource and less as a part of this world. They do not take into account their consciousness (anyone who wants to try to use the argument they are not conscious or we can't prove their consciousness go ahead with that arrogant thinking. It's what got us here in the first place. Looking at anyone wanting to use the scientific argument I always hear. Hopefully less likely to hear that in this sub). Also the amount we as a society consume is way more than is needed. The goal is to live in harmony with the planet. We are certainly not doing that in the way we consume meat products. If you were to go out and hunt your own game (like in the case of deer where they are overpopulated and can actually cause harm to the ecosystem and, like the native americans, use as much if not all of the animal to your advantage) you could consider yourself to be living in harmony with nature. I think as a species on this planet going plant-based with our diets is more about going back to being mindful of the way we eat and realizing that the way we consume our food matters in the grand scheme of things. We need to realize we do not NEED meat to survive like we've been led to believe by the meat industry but that if done correctly can still be spiritual. Give thanks to the being that provided the sustenance and be mindful of how much and what kinds of meat you consume. A food source living in cruelty or fear will pass that energy to you. A happy and/or natural food source will pass on more positive energy when consumed.","Nothing matters for the enlightened.
But as you have just started, plant based diet will do wonders. Stick with it.
Much love and peace to you","Absolutely, you can be spiritual and eat meat. Evolution has evolved you as a predator and it‚Äôs in your flesh‚Äôs nature and purpose to do it. The idea is to be respectful of your food, it‚Äôs earned with honesty and it does not offset the balance of nature (for example, one could avoid eating a kind of fish that is collapsing a food chain in the seas on the other side of the world).","I like to think that diet is very individual and depends solely on the person's physiological make up which then determines what kind of fuel works best for that individual.  After all, food is fuel for our physical body.  So if plant-based food works for you, then that's the diet that allows you to work efficiently on your spiritual growth.  However, meat is also a diet and can fuel the body as well.  What's unique about meat and why a lot of people crave for meat is due to its heavy density which corresponds the current heavy dense energy of Earth.  It's heavy and dense and for some people who are either spiritual or non-spiritual, this is a more preferable diet because it helps ground them on this Earth.
There is a general trend to blame food for the cause of our spiritual suffering and or lack of spiritual growth, but I think this is an incomplete understanding of why we suffer.  We suffer because we are holding on to our egos longer than we should and it is our egos that are causing the suffering of life and the willingness for us to keep experiencing suffering that our egos want us to be in.  Sometimes, our egos can convince us that eating the right kind of food or drinking the right kind of drink are the true salvation to our suffering.
That does not mean that eating plant-based food isn't the goal we should strive for.  As we get more spiritually mature and are able to ground ourselves easily to Earth, then we naturally rely less on heavy dense food like meat and desire more plant-based food.  But that is a gradually shift on the diet for some spiritual people.  However, the majority of people out there will need to eat meat until they have progressed to higher stages of consciousness where they become lighter and rely less on dense foods to keep them grounded.  So the answer to your question is that you can be spiritual and eat meat.  In fact, Gautama Buddha died at the age of 80 supposedly by eating spoiled meat and Jesus Christ ate fish.  And we know what both of them had contributed to the spiritual movement, so eating meat does not deter anyone and even Buddha/Jesus to achieve spiritual growth."

; remember to be kind and assume good faith :)","I recently received the Morocco clay mask in a Yesstyle haul and received some samples from Perfect Image. I decided to put the two clay masks to the test and see which would be better. Before trying both of these I have been using the Aria Star mud mask which is found on amazon... it works alright, but I don‚Äôt feel like my pores get cleaned out so well.
My skin type is oily/combo... I used to be greasy af when I was younger, but now I‚Äôm not so bad but it can still get oily if I skip niacinamide or it‚Äôs just too hot lol. I cleansed my face before using each of these masks. I took a pic right after rinsing, before applying any other skincare.
I tried the Morocco clay mask first on May 2nd... I only used a thin layer as the consistency of this mask is a bit gritty compared to other clay masks. It didn‚Äôt really have a scent (disclaimer: my sense of smell cannot be trusted). Aside from the gritty texture, it applied just fine. It says to leave in for 5-10 minutes, but I left it on for around 15. Once it dried my face felt tight and I rinsed it off with lukewarm water. My face felt very refreshed, cleansed, and nourished. I really enjoyed it.
I tried the Mega MUD on May 10th... I definitely used a thicker, but still thin, layer of this mask compared to the morroco clay. Instructions say to leave it on for only 2-3 minutes and increase to 5-15 minutes ‚Äúwith tolerance‚Äù, but I left it on for 40+ minutes because I wanted it to dry up completely and if I wanted the peptides to do anything... I figured the longer it was on the more effective it could be since washing it off right away wouldn‚Äôt allow for the mask to even dry completely, let alone absorb the nutrients from the clay into the skin and pull out oil and debris from my pores. Despite me letting it dry til patches of the mud started to turn white, the results were nice! I‚Äôll admit, it didn‚Äôt leave my face feeling as cleaned out compared to the Morocco clay mask, but I think the peptides and other ingredients had an effect. So, this is like an anti aging treatment with multiple benefits... and a little less emphasis on the skin detoxing part.
All in all, I liked them both. Do we have a winner? It depends on your skin needs. I am personally going to repurchase the Morocco clay because I have plenty of anti-aging stuff that it might be overkill and the main purpose I got the clay mask was for detoxing my pores. If you want a slightly more luxurious treat for your skin, then the mega mud is a great option as its price range isn‚Äôt quite at the luxury level, yet it isn‚Äôt cheap either ($30/2oz). The Moroccan clay mask runs at ~$15/100ml which gives you more product for less than half the price.
I hope this helped someone that may have been on the fence about these products or someone looking for a facial detox option!","""It says 2-3 minutes so I left it on for 40""
why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave
Seriously though thanks for the reviews they're great!",,This is fantastic info - thanks!

The global chip shortage will become less severe in the second half of 2022, AMD CEO Lisa Su said on Monday.
""We've always gone through cycles of ups and downs, where demand has exceeded supply, or vice versa,"" Su said at the Code Conference in Beverly Hills, California. ""This time, it's different.""
Manufacturing plants that were planned last year will likely start producing chips in the coming months, helping to alleviate shortages for PC parts and other microchips, Su said.",It's likely to end for AMD chips at least. AMD get even more 7nm capacity for mid and low end with 7/6nm still being superior to Intel's 10nm++ on top of 5nm capacity for everything high end that is going to get back the node advantage for another 1-2 years at least. There's rumors that even the PS5 and Xbox are moving to 6nm because of the increase density which leads to more chips per wafer.,to say this that means they are able to get more wafer capacity...,"They have always said they will be getting more and more capacity.  It makes sense as well as smartphones are usually the first to use a node due to small die size and efficiency being a bigger factor.  More and more Apple chips are moving to 5nm (Xr has been discontinued once the iPhone 13 was released so you only have SE and 11 using 7nm, iPad mini also went to 5nm) as well as Qualcomm for their smartphone chips.  Plus 7nm/6nm (as well as 5nm) fab capacity are still being added by TSMC a each month.","LISA SU at CODE conference:

I‚Äôm at 35N but for convenience I set my panels at 50¬∞ permanently to optimize for short winter days and to shed snow better. In summer the efficiency loss is negligible with the longer and generally brighter days.
I am also about 3x overpanelled with 1/3rd pointing SE, 1/3rd S and 1/3rd SW, this gives me solid production regardless of when the sun finally comes out. When it‚Äôs overcast it doesn‚Äôt much matter because atmospheric scattering lights them up pretty much the same regardless of which way they‚Äôre pointed.
I find this a good compromise for my situation, 2100 watts solar array and about 1.5kw delivered by the controller per day which fully recharges the batteries and includes all of my use.","It used to be that one had to decide between expensive tracking mounts and expensive static PV panels, but with PV so cheap these days, what you are doing makes perfect sense.
Oddly enough, my interest in the delivered solar energy per day was more to do with greenhouse heating than solar panels, but it still applies to simple equator-facing arrays, which many are, and sadly most are just flat upon the roof slope with no concern for optimal angles.
That book I pulled the image from has some good math on solar energy acquisition, worth a scan.","Optimizing for winter is really a smart idea; the summer is easy to take care of. And having panels aimed in different directions can be really useful. Depending on where people are, another idea is to put a rain gutter under them and use the rain catchment. I live in the high desert where water is gold; my panels equal about ~600 gallons of water a year in catchment area. No small thing, if water is precious. If you're in a wet climate, no big deal I guess.","I thought this was interesting because it shows the accumulated radiation received per day while taking into account the angle of the sun throughout the day against a fixed surface facing the equator.
I suppose it's a direct measurement for thermal panels (assuming 90%+ efficiency when used for heating), and for PV with the panel efficiency multiplier and conversion to kWh from MJ.",

Most affordable and scaleable would be ground mount systems, depending on your property and available space. Your initial hurdles will be system sizing and approvals. Starting small and scaling with production will help keep initial costs lower and hopefully allow you flexibility in your spending for future upgrades, additional miners, facility upgrades or more power production. HVAC costs can be a major factor as well depending on your facility type and location. Liquid immersion looks very promising, but currently it appears to be feasible for larger farms running 200+ rigs.  Your tax liabilities and potential for offsets as well as any available energy credits in your area could also greatly offset your system net cost. Purchasing as a business would also open open accelerated depreciation on the solar assets providing an additional tax incentive.  Battery banks are EXPENSIVE and the capital would be better spent on more miners/ performance improvements imho.

Firstly we need to think about the money because although he has a lot of ""money"", it mostly isn't in liquid. Most of his ""value"" is in assets. I'm sure he can afford to use some of his assets but he needs to pay everyone and everything that this will need. That is a large cost. Next let's talk about his shipping network. Yes he does have the logistics all figured out but, going back to money, if the food is taking up spots on the plane that would normally be packages, he is losing profit on Amazon because instead making money on that, he is spending even more money attempting to ship food. Next let's talk about the infrastructure of the places that need food. Most of the united states may be able to support getting the food their by truck and stuff but in other countries, they might not be able to support it all yet, especially with these ""refrigerated"" containers which are heavy.

However there is a lot more to it. The US made it policy to privatize its near earth space program. NASA no longer operates a spacecraft capable of taking astronauts to or from the space station - we have been paying Russia to ferry American astronauts. I personally find that embarrassing due the country that put a man on the moon.
The thought was that privatizing it would lead to innovation and reduction in costs - both of which had actually happened. Private companies are looking at tourist travel, manufacturing in orbit and a host of other applications.
And if you are trying to convince the public that space travel for fun is safe - what better way than to have a well publicized ride with your founder on the ship.",Spacex is now the one ferrying American astronauts. No longer using the Soyuz instead we use the dragon capsule on a falcon 9,,"Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin have very little to do with NASA (aside from BO's role in the National Team for the HLS contract, which they lost but might win second place again because politics).
Both are essentially just tourist agencies, and while BO has big plans for New Glenn and the BE-4, they're still not interacting much with NASA.
There is SpaceX, who's won NASA's heart (mostly because they've done an incredible job), but they have virtually no Tourism capacity right now. They will be doing a tourist mission soon (Inspiration 4) but Elon won't be flying on it.
Cost reductions and such did happen, but VG and BO don't have anything to do with it - in this sense, the whole ""Billionaire v Billionaire"" contest is just their two companies showing off what they can do to try and sell tickets. If they had launched months or even years apart the first to start operating would have a huge advantage. Both have realistically had the ability to start a lot sooner, but between safety and reliability, both have been waiting.
Ultimately VG's Spaceship and BO's New Shepard are just demos for the rich, with more affordable options coming down the road
. VG has more clear cut plans of what that'll look like with their starship 3, but BO is really secretive and hasn't let the public in on their future tourism plans. My bet is that they'll take a break from tourism development and fly NS for a few years until they run out of customers, then stop worrying about tourism until they develop something much larger and different like a space station or lunar base - both of which would be decades and decades out at this rate.",

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs super jealous of SpaceX,‚Äù one industry official, who spoke anonymously to discuss private matters, said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really worried about them. That is very clear.‚Äù
I wonder how true this is.  If Bezos is so jealous of SpaceX, why isn't he doing something to transform BO into a fast-moving innovator like SpaceX?
The whole reason why SpaceX is so successful is because they move fast, embrace failure to learn quickly in order to iterate effectively, and deliver results for its customers.  Bezos will never mimic SpaceX's success for which he is supposedly so jealous if his company moves even slower than a tortoise (more like a stunned snail on tranquilizers).","He brought in outside consultants a few years ago to compare and contrast how the two companies operate, so BO could learn what they needed to change to pick up their pace.

Join the OOTL Discord for further discussion: ","Answer: The user has a hypothesis that Jeff Bezos and his company Amazon are colluding with financial groups to devalue and eliminate brick and mortor competitors in domains that Amazon wants to expand into.
They also posit that this has happened in the past, with examples such as Toys R Us and other toy companies, or Blockbuster and other movie companies, two domains that Amazon has grown into and no longer has any major competition.
The final point is that Gamestop was meant to be the latest victim of this scheme before it blew up like it did, and it is also known that Amazon has been trying to get into gaming lately, with little success.
While this hypothesis seems plausible and perhaps even likely, this specific idea isn't supported by any ""smoking gun"" and is more based on speculation issued from various individual pieces that may or may not actually fit together. Now that more redditors have their eyes on it, more evidence might come out for or against it",Just to add.

Competition is bad, because it pushes the profit down.
The incumbents have two options to deal with competition. Aquire the competitor, or what is far cheaper, team up with a hedge fund, short the competition into bankruptcy while funneling the proceeds into your stock. WIth a bankruptcy, evidence of naked shorting is wiped out and the incumbents can scoop up their competitions assets in a bankruptcy sale if they so choose.
And I think this procedure has been going on for a long time, that's why these motherfuckers took GME to 240% short interest and probably north of 1000% now. When this technique has proven successful for perhaps the entirety of your career at a SHF, why wouldn't it work with GME? I suspect they have naked shorted other companies to bankruptcy numerous times and have the process down to a science.
I'm very curious of what is going to happen to the stock price of the FAANGM once every fund with a short position in GME is inevitably liquidated. Motherfuckers are going to get a first hand lesson in what infinite risk actually means.",,Absolutely.  üíØüíØüíØ,

Jeff Bezos,Jeff Bezos pledges $1 billion to protect 30 percent of the Earth‚Äôs land and sea,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/psh3e1/jeff_bezos_pledges_1_billion_to_protect_30/,"It's funny, in february 2020, he pledged $10 billion to fight climate change.
He, to date, has only donated around $500 million, while liquidating $10 billion in 2020 alone, (his year-over-year liquidation has been around that for a while). The rest mostly just goes to him and buying new houses.
Along with the fact that Amazon didn't pay any taxes in 2018 and 2019, and actually got tax refunds to the tune of $129 million. Amazon then said that they would pay taxes, and proceeded to pay 1.2% income tax rate (that is low even for corporate america and the status quo of wealthy tax evasion. 15% is the average for wealthy companies). That's the equivalent of the average American paying $420 in taxes per year. Literally the only reason amazon is the giant that it has become is tax evasion, exploitation of under-paid employees, and anti-free-market practices such as absorbing loss on the backs of wealthy investors until they drive competition out of business, then jacking up prices or buying out competitors.

Squid Game,Squid Game ending...,https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/pvfaer/squid_game_ending/,"I think it's because people irl aren't all 1D. The guy went through
 life and death situations. It's not that easy to see people (esp your friends) die in front of your eyes and
 you can't do anything to help them because all players (in the 2nd round) chose that path and faith.
What he went through was a traumatic event. And his mother, the person that loved him unconditionally and supported him financially and emotionally his whole life, died and he wasn't by her side. So it's too naive to expect him to still stay happy and bright and continue living his best life as if nothing has happened.
Edit: Also I agree that he was a bad father to his daughter and he had an opportunity to be a good father figure to her but he still turned his back on her. But you can see that his daughter was never a priority in his life. Before, he cared about gambling and money more than he cared about her. He even forgot about her birthday. So Ig some things never change lol. He was always a bad father to her and he still is.
My theory on why he dyed his hair red: Red is really prevalent in the series. When he was playing the envelope flipping game with the guy in the suit (in the subway station), he chose the color blue (over red). And he ended up being a participant in the game and wore a green tracksuit. The soldiers all wore red, and they held power over the players. And in many instances they were the ones who killed the players. So I think he chose red this time because he wants to be a soldier not a player, as in he wants to be in control of his own life.",These are great points! Thank you for sharing. And I love the red-hair analogy.,,"hmm I like your interesting thoughts on the colour red.
Personally I didn't like the ending, being such a deep emotional series, and well planned out, the whole Il Nam reveal to Gi-Hun could have been much better.
There are still lot's of questions but the main one that annoys me is why would such a rich person create the game with the only reason being he and his friends got bored of money? They just wanted to see people compete in kid games but also die in the process? I'm not convinced.
Il Nam would never have intended to participate in the games himself if it was fun for them to see people get killed. He also said he reminisced when he was a child and played so much he lost track of time. This sort of explains him trying to recreate those memories and using socialisation and interaction as a catalyst in the whole equality aspect but kids played because of the social fun aspect, not the killing which made no sense to kill. I was expecting something much more deeper and well developed but it was stupid and didn't make sense.
I think the police officers photos did send and there will be a detective that will help Gi-Hun, we will also learn about the hierarchy system of the soldiers and probably more on the game recruiter and front man.
I will still probably watch season 2 but the whole explanation as to why the games exist needs more convincing.",

However, since there haven't been any public tests with it, they might've jumped the gun and accidentally revealed it early on that Age of Empires trailer.
Microsoft is also planning to add streaming to consoles - that is you will be able stream games from cloud to your console. One use-case for this is that you can test Game Pass games before downloading them.
It might also be possible to stream PC games to console. Granted, these will more than likely be PC games that are available with PC Game Pass (and Game Pass Ultimate) but it still would be pretty nice thing to have. Then you could play games like AoE on your console (mouse and keyboard required of course).
It's also interesting to see what kind of specs they will have for their PC server blades and will they continue with AMD or use Nvidia's hardware. I'm kind of expecting them to go with AMD because AMD can provide both CPUs and GPUs. If they were to choose  Nvidia's GPUs, Microsoft would still need to source CPUs from either Intel or AMD.","Microsoft certainly has the ability to allow more PC style games on Xbox Series X with keyboard and mouse support.

Age of Empires 4,Recommendation for Small Footprint to play Age of Empires 4 and some VR,https://www.reddit.com/r/PcMasterRaceBuilds/comments/ottj1r/recommendation_for_small_footprint_to_play_age_of/,"So your build is going to come down to the displays. WIth the way GPU prices are, you may be looking at some used hardware. Also I'm sure that someone will come in shrieking about the terrible sin of using a TV for a monitor. They have never had to deal with this thing called a budget.
Given your 1 or 2 non VR games are 1) causal, 2) with family, 3) slow paced, 4) you already have the TV, good enough is in fact good enough. Sure the monitor may be a nice to have, but from a more hardware standpoint it makes about as much sense as someone doing 3D rendering work swapping a spread of 4k/60 monitors for a single 1080/360FPS monitor because ""more FPS"". I'm sure that will come in very handy when it comes to watching digital paint dry.
Mixed news for fitting it behind the TV. Yes it is possible (ITX+creative mounting), but ITX tends to cost more and creative mounting solutions is know by NZXT to cause spontaneous case fires (they had PCIe rises that would catch fire due to bad design. Oops). Still mATX and a creatively small case should get you roughly console sized footprint. Something to keep in mind, this is one of the very few use cases for 120mm AIOs
For the VR side of things, some flavor of 1660 is about as low as you want to go in terms of a GPU. Its mostly down to VRAM and 6GB is really pushing the minimum viable, 8GB is a lot more comfortable. At least your not trying to drive an Index. Any current gen card will work, 2060S or better from last gen. 5700(X?) if you go AMD is probably minimum viable. But its going to come down to finding a GPU first and building around that with the rest of the budget.
Just for a rough idea of what your looking for. And thats assuming the prices aren't doing something stupid like last gen CPUs being more than there current gen replacements.",Thank you so much for the explainer and for being so thorough!,Here bro.. this should be much smaller and should fit behind the tv if the tv is not too close to the wall.. many parts are on sale in this list so get them soon,Thank you!

Age of Empires 4,"Indie Game Dev Asks And Answers ""What's Going on with Arrows in Age of Empires 4?""",https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe4/comments/mt2jbe/indie_game_dev_asks_and_answers_whats_going_on/,"I think the entire video is worth watching as he goes into a bit of detail about what exactly about the arrow animation looks bad and some of the reasons why the devs may have made things this way. Of course, his explanations are speculative but I think a good chunk of his explanations were probably touching on the truth.
 he describes what he would like to see be done differently. His conclusion is basically that what's most important for the game is that the player know when the arrows fire and what they hit. The animation should emphasize and clarify these two factors, but everything that happens in between firing and hitting should be de-emphasized.
Edit: I think his recommendations are generally pretty reasonable but I do think it'd be pretty obvious if arrows collide with a wall but pass through. This would be a pretty frequent occurrence when archers inside (not on top) of a wall fire on attackers outside. Perhaps archers shouldn't be able to fire from one side of a wall to the other in some situations? This would make walls provide more defense against archer raids which would affect balance. Could be positive or negative.
Other than the situation of archers firing from one side of a wall to another I think ignoring collision makes a bunch of sense and situations where arrows pass through objects mistakenly wouldn't be noticed much by players.","While the arrows don't look that great as you've pointed out, I actually still don't mind it too much as in the middle of gameplay it won't be something I notice. I know others have addressed this by it still being ""bad"" but to me It's just a personal thing where I don't care much about it.
I think it comes down to preference. Some people might find this really annoying while others don't invest too much into thinking about it like myself. I respect the opinion nonetheless. I'm curious to see how developer views player feedback though.",Style is all about details though,,"That's one hell of a video, actually.  Really well done. Seems like a good dude, too."

Some of the old games using sprites look pretty good even today. Stronghold, AoE2, Civ2, the impression games city builders, etc. And why does it matter that a game looks outdated in a few years when games like civ get a new sequel every few years anyway?
I dunno, taste is subjective and shouldn't be discussed, but I feel like the civilization franchise lost some of it's ""historical epicness"" when it went for the pixar characters and bright colors everywhere.

Age of Empires 4,Some Age of Empires 4 Suggestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe4/comments/njkog2/some_age_of_empires_4_suggestions/,"The pop limit allows for interesting divergences. You could theoretically get an Athens versus Sparta situation where one power is strong on land and the other by sea. Of course, that could only work on a map with a mainland and also lots of islands that have resources for the player depending on naval superiority. The athens-style player would have a smaller army that is made much more mobile by virtue of controlling the water. He would depend on strong fortifications to hold any mainland territories.","Most of these ideas I like but they're probably overtly ambitious. Remember Relic's previous games. Even basic customizable key bindings and chat controls (on/off language filter, user ignoring etc.) aren't given. As always,
 option that's even a little bit subjective in preference, should be left for the player to toggle and adjust even if it ends up buried in Advanced Settings. #3cents","Ships should count towards pop cap, no build limits. They should be limited in other ways - like cost and build time.","but then that would mean loss pop space for land units. think about it, what would you really prefer? a hard 200 unit limit regardless of where you invest, or having naval as an additional theatre of war, without needing to sacrifice your empire size to interact with it.
a build limit would be much less restrictive then a pop limit if you like to control large numbers of units and make naval as important as the land aspect, if not more due to 0 pop economic power.",

Age of Empires 4,"Age of Empires 4 is coming this fall with asymmetric factions, naval combat, and 4 historical campaigns",https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTimeStrategy/comments/mo93zw/age_of_empires_4_is_coming_this_fall_with/,"I think the best bit of news with this (at least to me) was the confirmation that AoE4 will
 be embracing the ""flat chessboard"" terrain popularized by StarCraft. Rolling hills, little creeks, and benefits to using them correctly ... They're all in!","It also looks like it embraces the fundamentals of AoEII (the most popular of the series) while taking the best of what it can from AoEIII and AoM (asymmetrical factions) and being innovative in all respects.
The hunt-and-carry for deer by a scout looks like the kind of change to AoEIV that really makes it
 compared to AoEII. Instead of finnicking with pushing deer, your scout has a new role that helps contribute to your early economy. It is so intuitive and helps smooth out early gameplay that, even though it may ultimately be relatively minor, thrills me to think about how AoEIV has its own place in the franchise.
Meanwhile they had no problem keeping to AoEII's 4 resource and 4 age paradigm. The fact that Mongols can get early Cavalry is just one of the many hints that civilisations will be more ""fully realised"" and characterised compared to one another than in AoEII.
The only concern is how much more difficult asymmetrical factions are to balance. This isn't a difference of three or four units (unique unit, camel, Steppe Lancer, and Eagle Warrior). But the way they phrase the Mongols on AgeOfEmpires.com as a civ that must mobilise to secure resources across the map and this one that relies on its mobility and aggression sounds like such a thematic fit for game balance, I can't help but love the asymmetry.",,"Was going to say the MOST exciting thing is asymmetrical factions.

If you take a look at SC2 there you can a game that's more competitive and has some real dark maps with no complementary colors to try and help the players and this is just one example of games like Dota 2 and Path of Exile are dark aswell, but players are used to it.
So in the end i don't see anything convincing this entire video to argue agianst what the other side is saying and it won't be easy to convince either when we can clearly see from our own eyes what type of style this leans more towards even it wasn't intentional.","Uh, SC2 is super cartoony and exaggerated - have you tried zooming in at those units?

Based on our study, the panels could be located on rooftops and defunct coal mine sites, on agricultural sites, and floating on Indonesia‚Äôs calm equatorial inland sea.
Indonesia has a land area of 1.9 million square kilometres and a maritime area of 6.4 million square kilometres. The area required for all these solar panels in 2050 is 35,000 square kilometres, or 100 square metres per person. This is only

Hopefully the iPad Pro 11‚Äù will still be available and in stock by that point.,,There's always black friday Apple products sales on Amazon.,"Simple answer: Money.
Apple is able and willing to outbid competitors for the chips they need. TSMC is one of the biggest chip manufacturers and who Apple uses. They are able to make a certain amount of chips each day and they sell that capacity to the highest bidder (within the terms of whatever contracts they may already have in place). Apple alone accounts for 20% of TSMCs total revenue. It also has to do with the manufacturing process used for the different chips. The Xbox and PS5 are using TSMCs 7nm process. AMD is also using the same process for their Ryzen CPUs and their Radeon GPUs. While those three are competing with each other for TSMCs 7nm capacity, they aren‚Äôt competing with most of Apple‚Äôs products which are using the 5nm process (A14, A15 and M1). There are also other chips makers like Samsung, which is a completely separate supply that doesn‚Äôt effect Apple."

The company may or may not be legit, but nothing you've shared here inspires confidence. If someone I cared about got these sort of solicitations I would urge caution.
Here are the two big red flags I see
You have to buy in. Legitimate companies rarely require you to buy their product. Name one other company that makes you spend money upfront, and then tell me if you want to work for such a company.
200k a year is crazy money for this. Where does that money come from, even? Sales jobs can make bank, sure, but not for someone new and without training or experience or connections.
This job likely doesn't exist and is just a means for selling to you or her. The trickiest part is proving this.
Ask for referrals, individual and business. Where is their home office located (go visit, does it look they give employees 15k checks a month)? What is their UBI? Their business license info? What does state records show for this business (check DOL for a database of businesses in your state)?
How much do they want you to buy in for? It's probably hundreds at a minimum, and then what? They aren't offering an hourly or salary role, just commissions which isn't worth anything without the structure of a reputable business to back it.
Again, show caution here. I'm sorry but this will likely be a letdown, one way or another. Wishing you and your wife the best.","This about it: Does your wife have a hard sales background? Does she know anything about solar energy and or construction? Does she u der stand real estate?

Jeff Bezos,Overall do you think Jeff Bezos has contributed to society or harmed society?,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/q71tul/overall_do_you_think_jeff_bezos_has_contributed/,"Welcome to
. Remember that this subreddit is aimed at high quality discussion, so please elaborate on your answer as much as you can and avoid off-topic or jokey answers as per
.","The criticism is not so much of Bezos or Amazon, but rather the societal structure that makes it possible for someone to amass such an enormous fortune with little benefit or reward for the workers that made it possible.
The goal of corporations is to deliver returns for shareholders. In many situations, this objective is to the direct detriment of workers, which can lead to issues like stagnant wages and poor working conditions. Because ultimately, less money in the pocket of workers means more money in the pocket of shareholders.
This begs the question, does this corporate structure really benefit society?
The pandemic has shown that we need consumers out there spending money to keep the economy running. But what happens when the workers don‚Äôt have money leftover to spend? This is why wealth inequality is such a big issue. It‚Äôs not just about fairness‚Äîeven wealth distribution is essential for a healthy economy. That‚Äôs why the government hands out stimulus checks when the economy is having a rough time.
In Monopoly, when a player has all the money and everyone else is bankrupt‚Äîthe game is over.
As a society, that‚Äôs where we are heading.
The pandemic has clearly shown that it is the workers who generate the wealth, and shifting this wealth from workers to shareholders is ultimately not sustainable nor does it benefit society.
Much like climate change, the ‚Äútax the rich‚Äù movement is about saving the economy before we reach a tipping point.","In Monopoly, when a player has all the money and everyone else is bankrupt‚Äîthe game is over.
Yeah, wasn't monopoly made to point out this problem?",,"I've always thought of an capitalistic economy like a water turbine or electric motor. Its not how much water or electricity you have that measures how well it works, it's how much

Squid Game,Squid Game Director: ‚ÄúI wanted to write a story that was an allegory about modern capitalist society‚Äù,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/q60hv4/squid_game_director_i_wanted_to_write_a_story/,What is this sub‚Äôs thoughts on the show? Specifically I‚Äôm curious about episode ‚ÄòGganbu‚Äô,"I don't know the episode names, so spoiler for the show in general and the bridge game episode below..
The bridge game I felt was the best at showing the massive disconnect between the stated purpose of the game (everyone being there by choice and participating in a true meritocracy) and the reality (the lower class being exploited for the benefit of the rich).
The whole time they hammer to the players that it is fair, people breaking or bending the rules will be punished, everyone has a chance, etc.
The start of the bridge game destroys this point by essentially having the players participate in a birth lottery. Everyone knows the numbers will have relevance, but no one knows what it is. The main character goes through every possibility he can think of, but there is no way to ""win"" at this point of the game. It's truly random.
Where the illusion of fairness shatters completely is at the end. The players have found a way to beat the game that the game masters missed. The glass is actually perceptibly different to a trained eye. If the game was truly a meritocracy, this discovery and mastery of the game would have been applauded. But the rich demand the game is played according to their desires, and they desire blood. They changed the rules midgame to get their desired result.
To me this illustrated that as much as the rich will claim the game is fair and based on merit, they will change the rules on a whim if they find the lower classes behaving unpredictably or taking advantage of loopholes.
As for the game in general, of course no one was there 100% by choice. The choice was die as a result of your debts or play the game. Very basic exploitation of a vulnerable group of people to the benefit of a ruling class.",,"I'm watching that episode tonight. I'll let you know after I see it. Without spoiling too much, some of the more striking elements from a socialist perspective so far are: the game runner's obsession with the pretense that his game is an egalitarian meritocracy where everyone has an equal chance to get rich and harsh punishment of those who derive an advantage outside his arbitrary set of rules; the game runner's obsession with the pretense that everyone has come to the games by choice despite his active exploitation of the players' medical and other debts, as well as their specific social vulnerabilities, in order to gain their consent; and the main character's flashback to a violent police crackdown on a strike and worker-occupation of an automobile plant.
The main character of the b plot is a rogue cop infiltrating the games to find his missing brother. He hasn't been excessively lionized so far so I wouldn't necessarily categorize it as copaganda but we'll see where his story goes.
edit: ok so that episode expands on the theme of legalism by having a game with very vague rules where deception is condoned. It's also the most we hear from Sae-Byeok, the defector from North Korea, which is still honestly not much and mostly a rehash of what we already know about her. Someone else in the comments was complaining about the depiction but it didn't strike me as particularly propagandistic. A couple thousand people a year really do illegally emigrate from North Korea, sometimes people really do get shot crossing the border, and there really was a famine around the time of the character's childhood. It also shows that people crossing the border often find a whole new set of problems in the South, including homelessness and predation by organized crime. On the other hand, we never hear why her family was trying to leave, which could be interpreted as the story just taking for granted that all North Koreans would want to. Other than those things we hear very little about her (or anyone else but Gi-Hun's) backstory.",

I actually made a ryzen build with pretty similar components for a friend.  Here are some pictures of what this build would look like when completed:
As for the parts
The vetroo v5 is a nice cooler for the price, will provide better cooler performance than the stock cooler and be much quieter.  You can't overclock the 10400f although you could increase beyond the stock 65w power limit.  I'm not sure if it will have as much affect on the 10400f as it does on the 10700/11400 though.
This motherboard has great vrms, especially for the price.  Better quality than the equivalent entry level boards from gigabyte, ASRock, and Asus.  Get the ""wifi"" version of this motherboard if you need wireless wifi or Bluetooth.
For the power supply, I would either get a good one that will work with this build (like the b5 in the list) or get an overkill, high quality, 750w that can be reused in future builds, like this
 or this
 which are both currently on sale for $90.
This case has great airflow with the stock fans.  Also, since it's micro ATX it will look nice with the micro ATX motherboard.  From my experience, it was just as easy to build in as an ATX case.
16gb 3200mhz ram
The a2000 is a good SSD and at $95 it's priced with dramless or qlc entry level SSDs",What do you think of this build? Used your picks along with some from the other poster - ,"That budget isn't great for a build revolving around a 3060 Ti, not in these times with these prices...

From a chat with V....
Hi V, I've been doing DD on (sub $1B steel co). Correct me if wrong but from their last EC they seem to say at these prices and environment they benefit when auto doesn't take delivery. I know you've commented on it before, but with all the auto FUD coming up, I 'm wondering if you would care to clarify in more detail how these contracts work; ie do they pay something for skipping deliveries? do contracts get cancelled or rerated?
1:42 PM
*Contracts clarity not just for me, but for the sub.Uncle_Dad_Bob Snoovatar
Contracts are different with everyone - vendor and customer. As far as auto not taking, they are obligated to take what they have contracted. If not, it‚Äôs up to the manufacturer to hold the contract. They don‚Äôt normally pay for skipping. In an ‚Äúup market‚Äù the manufacturers are hoping they don‚Äôt take. If this was a down market, the rules would be different and they would have their feet held to the fire. Most contracts are being renegotiated now and the manufacturers will use the fact that ‚Äúif they skipped‚Äù deliveries as leverage for higher prices. Mostly all auto manufacturers keep taking and storing the steel. I think Toyota and Ford have both stopped taking about 30% of what they normally do. Which is being sold at spot.vitocorlene Snoovatar
So as long as HRC remains above older contracted prices, skipped deliveries are incredibly bullish both for short term spot sales and longer term higher priced contracts. This is incredibly bullish.
thanks for taking the time to reply.
Do you mind if I wait for 7th layer FUD and post your reply to the group?Uncle_Dad_Bob Snoovatar
You are welcome. Yes it‚Äôs bullish and it‚Äôs also why I believed LG retired the $MT, as he knew what was going on with auto and he would put more to the bottom line this quarter based off spot sales and more next quarter based off spot. Post away.vitocorlene Snoovatar",So in conclusion this is bullish af because manufacturers not taking delivery = higher sales in the spot market. Makes sense for this Q but I wonder how long this could last; how high is demand in the spot market to make up for lost revenue from manufacturers not taking contractual delivery?,,"""New car sales plunged over the last three months""
That is fact, but HRC prices have remained at historically high prices too.  All things being even then, when the chip shortage diminishes, we'll see more auto manufacturer demand for steel. Clf is the largest supplier of steel to the automotive industry in North America.
Then, of course, there is the $1.2 trillion infrastructure which is taking its time getting passed and that is absolutely perfect as we want demand high and constant, not rampant and temporary.
Then there's U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai in Pittsburgh, stating we'll build on prior trade agreements with the EU, essentially holding China's feet to the fire, preventing them from continuing with their dumping practices.
Then, there's inflation which increases the value of resources and CLF as an integrated steel manufacturer is a double resource play.

I do not.
The thing is, Stadia makes a little bit of sense for a budget-conscious or portability-oriented gamer who doesn't mind being limited on the library front, but it doesn't make a lot of sense for someone who has a dedicated battlestation and nowhere to go. At least speaking in terms of gamers in the US, I'm going to be frank and suggest that a whole lot of stimulus money was thrown at graphics cards, PC's and new consoles -- people invested in that since they were stuck inside.
And so you get the current situation -- there are the few of us who have really benefited from the service, and there are the huge masses for whom the service makes almost no sense because of their investments in the medium.
In the meantime, the one thing Stadia could do to immediately improve its station -- server upgrades -- is something they can't easily do because of chip shortages. Neither can they easily expand their offerings to other countries.
What could Google have done better to benefit from the pandemic?

I stopped after it brought up 2 myths: 1 - panels can't be recycled and are landfilled and 2 - panels are expensive.  Felt like a hit piece disguised as a think piece.  Kind of a Marc Antony, ""I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him"", vibe.
If I'm wrong, please downvote to oblivion.","I think you're right.  Every paragraph ends on a ""...and solar fails again"" note.
The actual facts as I see them are:
solar only accounts for a tiny fraction of renewable energy because there is already so much hydroelectric.   There's very little undeveloped hydro capacity.  There just aren't very many places we can build another Hoover Dam, Grand Coulee or Three Gorges.  Solar is the one form of renewable that we can build literally anywhere and that we can still build as much as we could ever need.
New solar is not expensive.  In fact, at the utility scale, it is almost the cheapest energy available.  ...and the price is
 dropping like a stone.
Recycling.  This is an area for improvement however there are three big considerations that mitigate the situation considerably.  First, a PV panel can continue to produce useful energy for a
 long time.  After 20 years, an ""end of life"" solar panel still produces 85% of the original energy.  After 40 years, about 60%.  If someone can find enough space (and did I mention that that space can be
?) solar panels can continue to contribute useful energy for 100 years or more.  Second, when the panels do fail, the majority of the mass is easily recycled glass and aluminum.  Finally, the economics of recycling entirely depend on available mass.  Right now there are only a few tonnes per year of panel being recycled.  Fast forward 40 years to when panels start being replaced in significant numbers, individual sites will be yielding truckloads of consistent materials.  If there's anything at all valuable in those panels, businesses will be competing to buy solar 'waste'.
Does anyone actually care how efficient solar is?  Last I checked, solar energy was not only free but abundant.  It is one of the only resources available to mankind that is invulnerable to the tragedy of the commons.",,What a fucking idiot,

 closer to the Stephen King (as Richard Bachman) book

Every contestant in
 is in desperate financial straits:  a North Korean refugee trying to save her family, a businessman wanted for embezzlement, a gangster who owes other gangsters a lot of money...but those last two are obviously there for spice.

Swiss Chocolate,Where can I find some high-quality gluten and dairy free Swiss Chocolate? ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞,https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/i49dxi/where_can_i_find_some_highquality_gluten_and/,"I don't know.
But here is a recipe for great melts-in-your-mouth dairy-free chocolate: You need cacao butter and a bar of dark chocolate, say 1 unit of cacao butter and 15 units of dark chocolate. Melt the cacao butter + 4/5th of the dark chocolate in the microwave. Put a small cup of water in the microwave with the chocolate or the chocolate will burn. Stir every 30 seconds even if the chocolate isn't melting yet. Once it is fully melted, stir the remaining  dark chocolate through the liquid chocolate.* Keep stirring until that chocolate is melted.
If you want, add nuts, raisins, biscuit crumps, dried fruit etc. As long as it is a dry thing you can add it. Don't add wet things - whether it's a damp spoon for stirring or fresh fruit or plain water. It'll make the chocolate seize (it'll harden immediately and become ugly, though it'll keep it's taste).
Pour into a silicone mold or pour on baking paper. Let set. This can take a while. Don't put it in the refrigerator. Enjoy your dark chocolate with the ""meltiness"" of milk chocolate!
*This process is called tempering and if you don't temper your chocolate, the wrong cacao structure will form, which basically means that it doesn't fully harden and will melt immediately when you pick it up - it's still edible (tastes the same, the structure is different though) but your hands will get chocolaty when you pick it up.",Switzerland,,,

To make the hazelnut praline, heat up 1/4 cup sugar water with 1 tbsp. water on medium heat until it starts to turn an amber color, then pour over around 1/2 cup roasted hazelnuts. Let cool and then grind up in a food processor (make sure to not grind it too much, as that will create a paste and not small crunchy praline bits).
To make the filling, heat up the heavy cream on medium heat, then take off the heat add in the chocolate. Stir until combined. Add in the butter, stirring until melted and then add the hazelnut praline. Let cool until set before filling.",,Chocolate hazelnut is one of my favorite dessert flavors :),those feet are incredible!

 the whistle, and never fought. Had zero fights on his NHL fight card (but still tried to play pest, post-whistle). Even Haulass fought a guy once.
From what I saw of the Carolina games I could catch going back a ways, you guys are getting a really sick center back, and some more youth at the center position. Will probably plug in well with at least one and probably 2 of your 4 or 5 high-end wingers. Like, Victor Rask is not gonna be a no-name, the kid was a 21-goal/nearly 50 point center not too long ago. I think the change of scenery trade will work out well for both teams, better wings like the Wild's should help lift the kid up, and now Nino's got a few new centers to try being on a new line with too.

Instructions Put the almond flour, sugar, chocolate, cinnamon and cloves in a food processor and process until you are left with a fine powder.
Add the egg white and pulse until everything combines. Bring the dough together into a ball. At this point, you can wrap and chill the dough if you prefer to make it a bit easier to work with.
Place a piece of parchment on your worktop. Sprinkle it with sweetener or almond flour if needed, flatten the dough slightly and cover with another piece of parchment then roll out. I have rolled to around 1/4 inch (3mm) but you can make these a little thicker.
Cut out shapes and transfer the cut cookies to a lined baking sheet/tray. Repeat with leftover dough scraps and start the process again until you are left with just enough dough to cut out one last cookie. Leave to air dry for at least 3 hours.

2 pieces of feedback:
I understand this was likely done on twitch, but if you know you are casting a youtube video, you should turn off the camera. It takes up way too much screen real-estate and adds absolutely nothing to the user experience.
The way you move the camera when you are playing is different from the way you do it for spectators. Watching someone else play an rts is jarring, it is no different here. Go check out any of the starcraft 2 vods and you'll see how they auto follow units with the camera, slowly pan at the sides, use the map to move the camera large distances instead of the edge of the screen, circle on screen stats with the mouse to highlight them to viewers, etc.",".

Age of Empires 4,Finding the Age of Empires 4 Beta Date - By Looking Into the Past,https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe4/comments/pn3wt9/finding_the_age_of_empires_4_beta_date_by_looking/,"Someone on the official forum also pointed out
 from Aussie on Youtube which ends with the sentence ""More content coming soon, and be sure to keep an eye out on Red Bull Wololo 5 ;)"". I'm not an AoE3 player so I don't really follow Aussie but it seems a bit strange for an AoE3 content creator to by hyping an AoE2 tournament in a post discussing a new rig he just built for AoE4. Hmmm. Red Bull Wololo does seem like a very natural place to show off Age 4 competitive gameplay as other have pointed out. And Aussie seems to play AoE4 at a relatively high level (he posted lots of good content on the closed forum), has experience casting high level AoE3 matches, and is a major AoE3 content creator so it seems like it'd be pretty natural to have him play in or cast an AoE4 show match.
There's also one campaign trailer (Mongols) they haven't released yet which could make an appearance. This would obviously be less exciting and would be a slightly odd choice for showing at a high level tournament and wouldn't explain Aussie's apparent involvement. I think a Mongol campaign trailer is possible but would likely be shown in addition to high level gameplay if it does make an appearance.
And of course the OP provides some reasonable historical evidence that there could be an open beta that begins late September which might plausibly be announced at the event.
If they do end up doing an AoE4 show match or even just show a Mongols trailer they'll almost certainly announce it or at least hint at it ahead of time. I'm gonna do my best to keep my hype in check until they do.","Yeah I don't know how much I trust that. I feel like a lot of people are assuming something will be shown at Red Bull Wololo V. I would love that to be the case but I think all the disappointing announcements and lack of showcases has made me very skeptical.
I am going to watch anyway because I love watching aoe2, but I am not expecting to see or hear anything about AOE4. I would recommend others not to expect it either or they'll disappoint themselves like we all did at Gamescom and E3 and various other dates haha.",,"I concur with you and would like to add something: when they announced the release date (10/28), in Game Pass the game was marked to be launched in 9/29. In that time I was thinking that it could be the open beta date, for, in my opinion, it would be a good way to build hype.","Ah it was you who posted the thread I linked yesterday. Clearly it was weird to see that date and is a real possibility now considering the timeline. People back then all hoped for a very long beta and that it would be open so was hard to believe the date could be right...

Along with the weird videos they keep putting out, I think they hired the wrong marketing team for the release!
UI doesn't necessarily 'meld' into the overall aesthetic, and the resource location can definitely be improved, but this is something that can be fixed later.",Video got take down. Was there blood as an optional setting?,,"I saw a leaked video yesterday on youtube when it got recommended to me, it had a few hundred views, don't know if it was the same one as this as the link is gone by now.
Anyways, the aesthetic seemed very pleasing to me and the gameplay felt very immersive with amazing sound design. The UI was slick and while most of the gameplay was zoomed out on a wide resolution, it looked good when zoomed in, albeit for a moment.
I say this again, most of the criticism is coming from people who aren't even going to touch this game and want to shit on the ""shitty"" AOE2 remake by the company that ""wronged"" them.
Not a single AOE youtuber I watch plays on the highest graphical fidelity, nobody stops to look at the awkward collisions. All the constructive criticism the game had received so far has received fixes gracefully and NO, shitting on the entire work of the dev team by stating that they are amateurs developing a shitty mobile game does not count as constructive criticism.
Someone compared the AOE4 to Anno yesterday, as if Anno has to be optimized for multiplayer and support a range of hardware to allow its the majority of its audience to enjoy the experience.
If they went for higher minimum recommended specs, they would've be shat upon the second the news hit the Internet. A loud minority that doesn't ever stop bitching.",

Even if it doesn't get ported to tablets (and I have no idea how that would work even remotely well for a RTS like this), it seems like they want it to be able to run on any PC.

That discovery period is really great when you find and see all the little things possible in the game. There was already micro tricks posted and I'm sure a lot more will be found out later on like the muta trick from SC2 you added to the video. I have already seen posts here about how there is zero micro possible in AOE4 and you just a-move... The game might not be the most micro/tricks oriented game ever but great players will always find tricks and ways to optimize their units/army/attacks. No way you'll be top player without that.
Personally hyped for everything but mostly watching the competitive scene. It's something that I really like about SC2 (streams, videos, big tourneys) but wasn't possible in the old AOM/AOE3 days when the games came out. Now AOE4 is finally here and everything is possible, it will be a lot fun to follow experts and hopefully many big tourneys.","Me, already hyped af, watching.

So yes, this all sounds awesome, but they're not saying anything concretely on when or how this is going to make it in the game. Just that a system like this would be ""chefs kiss"".
The most important time to have new player aides in a game is at launch. And the way this article is phrased I don't think we should expect a system like this on launch unfortunately.",The dynamic tooltips and Art of War tutorials will both be in the game at launch. This should provide a smoother introduction to competitive play than most other RTS. The longer-term features they mentioned would be pretty ground-breaking and the game can be great at launch even without them.,,"Nobody could over-promise like Peter Molyneux, he really developed it into an art","And it would be transformative outside of just the pure RTS genre, too. Imagine playing a MOBA where the game didn‚Äôt just offer recommended, preset builds, but the item shop could also make singular dynamic suggestions about particular items based on hundreds of thousands of games featuring the same heroes you‚Äôre facing right now. It‚Äôd help players bridge that gap from buying the right ‚Äúkinds‚Äù of items to understanding why they‚Äôre buying the items in the first place.
Dota already do this. It uses machine learning to suggest builds like items and skills to the player based on matches played.

They also have to keep paying their worker salaries, so what liquid assets they do have, get gobbled up immediately unless they have cash coming in from production and sales.  They can only store enough supply for a week or so.  So when demand went down, they had no choice but to cancel their orders.
Mazda on the other hand is pretty tiny.  It's much easier to store half a million excess chips.  A small corner of your factory could probably store them until you have demand again.

Suppliers says no to OEMs all the time either due to factory capacity or raw materials shortages.  This is why auto-makers often source from 2-3 suppliers (by purchasing policy) for every component.

I would guess there is enough if Apple is willing to pay a certain price for the chips.
Apple knows that consumers only buy so many iPhones and they want to make a certain profit off of each one.  So when supplier tells Apple that the chips are going to cost 20% more right now, Apple calculates how many iPhones they can sell at a price that compensates for the increased chip price.  They then make that many phones and raise the price to ensure they get their desired profit per unit.  They then blame the supplier to justify the price increase and give the appearance of true scarcity.  This delays some consumers in purchasing the iPhone.  In the future, if chip prices go down, they can either lower the price calling it a sale to increase demand OR keep the price the same and increase their profits per unit sold.  As long as Apple sells out of their manufactured products at the price they wanted they win.  The only way Apple loses is if they underestimate how many consumer will balk at the new prices and they end up with unsold phones at the time they release the next iPhone or if people switch to Android because of the price increase."

 in the Tesla thread on it, but this is less about Tesla avoiding it and more about them unintentionally putting themselves in a position to delay it, then extending that delay further through their agility to adapt to replacement chips. They will unquestionably be feeling it soon, either through the features in the cars (Example: passenger-side Lumbar Support controls in M3) or through production rates of their upcoming products. While the principal reason for Cybertruck and Semis delayed production appears to be the pending completion of Giga Texas, the chip shortage will likely impact them further in production numbers.

Solar Energy,Australian Solar Energy company doesn't know what a photon is,https://www.reddit.com/r/badscience/comments/psc1ar/australian_solar_energy_company_doesnt_know_what/,"From the site:
Solar panels depend on raw sunlight to produce electricity and raw sunlight contains a number of various particles. The most important particle for solar energy is the ‚Äòphoton‚Äô. When photons from the sun are exposed to solar panels, the electrons inside the panel charge and create a usable energy current. When the sun goes down, the electrons are no longer exposed to sunlight and therefore will not charge to create any electricity.
The moon does not generate its own light like the sun does and the reason why the moon lights up is because the sun‚Äôs light energy reflects off the moon‚Äôs surface area, thus creating the moon to shine. The moon produces no photons and none of its own light so unfortunately, it is not able to charge solar panels.
If you were to put a solar panel on the moon itself, it would generate electricity from the sun‚Äôs light but only during Earth‚Äôs night time hours, because the sun lights up the moon when the sun has gone down. So in theory, the only way for a solar panel to generate electricity at night time, would be to stick it on the moon!
However, all is not lost. So we‚Äôve established that the moon cannot charge solar panels, but what about the other light in the sky? That‚Äôs right- the stars. Like the sun has solar energy, stars have stellar energy. Stellar energy is the internal energy radiated by a star. If a material that is sensitive to stellar energy (the same way silicon is sensitive to solar energy) is used to create a ‚Äòstellar panel‚Äô then we might be able to combine the material with solar cells to generate energy from the light of the stars. Unfortunately this is yet to be made practicable but who‚Äôs to say it isn‚Äôt possible? Solar energy has come a long way as a result of research, so anything is possible.
e: I am told to explain why this is bad science.
Photons can bounce. That doesn't mean they are not photons. All photons are photons.","It doesn't know anything about astronomy either. Not even at the level a 10-year-old should understand.

""Earth's night time hours"" is not even a thing! Half of Earth receives sunlight at any time. Same for the Moon, but independently. A solar panel on the Moon would receive sunlight for two weeks at a time before having a two week night.",,"I can't read past ""when photons from the sun are exposed to solar panels"", it's too powerful. Literally can't read past the word ""panels"" in that sentence.","It's debatable if photons bounce or if they are destroyed, and a new photon is emitted, but it's kind of immaterial to what you're saying.
Also, it's possibly unknowable which one is correct, given the current understanding of physics."

This is perhaps one of the most cited concerns of clients. Let me be clear: A leaky roof is independent of whether it‚Äôs a green roof or a traditional roof. It has to do with the installation and design specification of the structure. All roofs must have a proper waterproofing membrane, green roofs included.
There is no evidence to suggest that green roofs are more susceptible to leaking.

Anyone want to dig up that chart that shows how ridiculously off predictions about solar installation have been?,,"Almost all the new power added to the grid was renewable last year, most of that being solar.
Something important to keep in mind when looking at ""45% from solar"" is that
 in the US;
 after accounting for capacity factor.
So when you feel that 45% solar is not enough, keep in mind that it's likely to be paired with a similar amount of wind, resulting in the two combined providing an overwhelming majority of electricity generation.
Solar is coming down by about 15%/year, so there's no reason to think almost all the power added going forward will be solar/wind. So why would it take 30 years to get 45% solar?
45% solar probably means ~3/4 of today's electricity generation capacity has been replaced with solar+wind+battery.  I agree with you that that's where we're headed - since, as you note, almost all added capacity (in the US and world-wide) is solar+wind+battery - but that's quite a lot of construction to accomplish in the next 9 years, so I think 2030 is overly ambitious.
You're probably right that 2050 is overly conservative just based on economics alone; however, I would argue that setting a target for ""lots of solar"" will speed up achieving that goal by helping adjust the mindset and focus of reluctant industrial or political stakeholders.",

Sorry for the all caps I just wanted to make sure the folks in the back heard it loud and clear.
Excellent post","I think that if Entergy were ACTUALLY losing money in a way that threatened them, the net metering policy would be suspended or limited. It's not actually in the city's best interest for Entergy to collapse. Someone has to have the responsibility of maintaining the grid. Obviously Entergy is doing a piss-poor job of that, and I might support a transition to a public utility, but given the state of our local government, I don't know if a public electric company would be any more competent or any less corrupt.
My real frustration is that net metering
 a real financial threat to Entergy. Net metering is the law of the land in more than thirty states, and those utilities are doing just fine. Obviously it wasn't stopping Entergy from making money before its repeal last year. And yet Entergy is throwing its full force against solar energy, despite the fact that more widespread distributed generation could make us better able to withstand natural disasters and decrease our reliance on fossil fuels. Over some market share loss (something that every other business has to accept and work around, by the way). We're on the front fucking lines of climate change here. We've eaten some of the worst weather events of the nation in the past two decades and it's getting worse all the time. Is it too much to ask that our welfare be the priority?",,"They also won‚Äôt allow you to disconnect from the grid AND they won‚Äôt allow you to install a system that generates more power than your home used in the last year.
Entergy has one driving goal and one goal only - maximizing shareholder return. They will do whatever is necessary, legal or otherwise, to protect their margins. They‚Äôre like bringing a wolf into your house and pretending it‚Äôs a dog - you can pretend but that motherfucker will eat your face if it wants to. Entergy is actively blocking the installation of solar power in the parish that could supplement the grid and reduce our reliance on outside energy - they can (and should) build industrial solar but they should also allow anyone in the city to generate as much power as they‚Äôre willing to install to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel and increase resilience.
It‚Äôs also painfully obvious that they can‚Äôt be relied upon to maintain the grid so their fees should be reduced to subsidize solar and distributed backup systems. There‚Äôs no point in paying them for maintenance that they‚Äôre just distributing to shareholders as dividends instead of maintaining their responsibilities. They‚Äôll pay $800 million in dividends this year alone and turned a $1.5 billion profit last year.
Finally, the fact that the rest of the state sold out on net metering doesn‚Äôt make it some kind of peril we should be grateful for. Frankly, I should be able to name whatever price I want for the energy I generate and Entergy can buy it or not, like the national energy market works. But I guess that would be too much of a free market for them."

For those who say you shouldn't be on disability for whatever reason in BC, I would say that you may not understand how rigorous the application and acceptance process is.

Crypto Currency,How are most crypto currencies not Ponzi scheme?,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/pukrxr/how_are_most_crypto_currencies_not_ponzi_scheme/,"I'm going to answer this from a legal perspective because there's a prevalent misconception of what a ""Ponzi scheme"" is.  The short answer is that what you're describing is not a ""Ponzi scheme.""  In a Ponzi scheme, a person invests in a business and is paid at regular intervals with funds from subsequent investors.  A Ponzi scheme involves the investors being deceived as to the sources/legitimacy of the funds used to pay them.
Crypto currencies don't work that way. If you buy one bitcoin, that's it. You own a bitcoin that might go up or down in value, but you aren't being paid in cash with funds from subsequent investors.  The only way you get cash is by selling the bitcoin, and there's no deception or mystery about where that money is coming from. So crypto currencies are not a ""Ponzi scheme.""
That's not to say crypto currencies are a good investment; beanie babies weren't a ""Ponzi scheme,"" but they also weren't a good investment.  It's also not to say that the ""investment advice"" people give about crypto currencies is legal. What you're referring to is something more like a
, where people artificially inflate the value of an asset with misleading statements.  That's much harder to prove than a Ponzi scheme. It's pretty easy to prove someone is lying about the source of a business's revenue if there's no legitimate business activity going on. It's much harder to prove someone is knowingly lying when they say, ""I think the value of [madeup coin] will increase 10%.""","I see. Your answer adequately counters my understanding of crypto. I previously thought ponzi schemes are those that don't actually produce anything and something completely reliant on getting other investors to invest in that scheme.

Most people probably just assumed it was an option due to all its other payment methods, not necessarily crypto. Going out and supporting crypto DIRECTLY is completely different as it's saying ""we basically agree to everything crypto is doing"". Not to mention it was completely unnecessary since PayPal is already a thing, so it's super shady that they wanted crypto as well. Like, why? To get an extra 10 customers or so? Literally none of the other dinosaur games that I know of is using crypto and they're doing fine without it, why does PoT need it so badly? They've already made up like a million from backers so you can't make the ""they need more money"" argument.","Not to mention how utterly tone deaf the devs had to be to think that this was a good idea. This is a dinosaur game for people who like dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are animals, people love animals, crypto is destroying animal habitats and ecosystems. Wtf did they expect, a pat on the back?","the other dinosaur games are steam games. Steam at one point supported crypto, but pulled out because of the lack of stability in cryptocurrency's value.
You know what else is a contributing factor to harm to the environment? The mobile phone industry. Apple alone leaves nearly as bad of a carbon footprint. Take other companies like Samsung into account which don't just make phones, and things start to get REALLY rough. But no one is going to complain about that as much as crypto mining why? Because phones are convenient. Phones are too integrated into everyday life. You won't see a complaint on the discord that the game is on mobile. People will look the other way for that, which is to be expected. I mean the game's majority population consists of mobile players.
Now I found the decision to add crypto to be unnecessary. Like you said, it probably helps a very very small percentage of people buy the game at the cost of, well, this. I think there are fair arguments to make against crypto. One of which was said in the discord and why steam pulled out, value instability. But if you're gonna fight the fight, make a fight that has grounds for fighting in this conversation. I don't think the eco point stands up as well for a video game that is largely on mobile devices that are also bad for the environment. Not to mention no one is gonna be mining crypto to buy Path of Titans. Costs more to have hardware to do that than to own the game. But that's more of a non-point because the problem isn't that PoT directly affects it, its that PoT now gives you the option to pay with something that does. It's indirect support, but support nonetheless. Which really should be the statement people make. But I've seen abhorrent things come from community members that really makes me question the integrity of their claims to be environmentally friendly. Just straight dismissive of actual conversation and downright unfair or cruel to each other. That's not everyone of course, I'm not here to generalize with that.

Crypto Currency,DAE not know wtf crypto currency is?,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoesAnybodyElse/comments/pjkujo/dae_not_know_wtf_crypto_currency_is/,Try the subreddit ELI5,,"I'll try to explain this as it was explained to me.
Imagine that there is a whole canyon with people a hundred yards apart all digging for gems. As someone finds a gem, they hold it up in the air and announce it to the whole canyon. Then everyone else who is ""mining"" looks up, shoots laser spectrometers at it, looks at it with high powered binoculars, etc. then everyone verifies that it is in fact a gem and records their data, verification and location of the gem that was found.
This continues anytime a gem is found and this is what mining cryptocurrency is very simply. Computers are solving difficult math problems and once they have a solution, other computers on the network verify that the solution is correct and record the location of a validated solution. Now, just like gems, the cryptocoins have worth, but less like gems, the worth is far more volitile. Gems have a baseline of value because it's been established for a long time that they are desirable for both beauty and practical reasons like manufacturing application, ie: diamond drillbits, ruby's for lasers (originally), etc. But with cryptos, they're not ""used"" for things, it's more like the way your bank keeps track of money, it's all digital and you really can't go to the bank and just withdraw $1b dollars if you technically have it. It's not there physically, it's just being placeheld digitally. Plus, the norm for currency is traditional currencies. The more people, businesses or governments that allow for trading with cryptos the more solid and trustworthy it becomes which will then make it less volitile.
I don't know if that helps, but it helped me understand the basic idea. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",Okay but why are the gems there in the first place?,

Short answer, yes. Almost all crypto's do not need to be sold as an entire token, because they are intrinsically different to Stocks.
I think the BTC - Gold analogy works best here, Gold is valued by weight, but you can buy any amount you can get your hands on, same with BTC (to an extent). I believe most big chains go to 8, 12 or 16 decimal places, but the developers can literally set this as a variable unless it needs to be hardcoded for the sake of particular functions etc.","What I'm able understand by this it would lead into very small small transaction recorded and validated.

There are many scale transformations that facilitate the use of fiat. Even gold became insufficient for these tasks. Crypto stands no chance here for it holds an intrinsic value of precisely $0.
The more interesting discussion is how Crypto stresses smaller countries with unreliable banks and governments to get their shit together. Once again though, as soon as those countries find some stability the Crypto is worthless. They are one of the most beautifully conducted Ponzi Schemes in history.","Bitcoin and the rest of the 'Crypto' are very different. BTC is Finite in supply and decentralized where the others are controlled by their respective development teams as opposed to node operators. Also, having ""intrinsic value"" (a borderline meaningless term, all value is subjective) is not required for something to act as money. This is obvious as we currently use slips of paper whos only backing is someone's promise of repaying the credit, an IOU basically. If all it takes is a promise from a socially accepted institution to make worthless paper into money ""intrinsic value"" has nothing to do with it. Gold is not viable because of it's physical limitations, it's hard to transport, divide, or secure without incurring cost/loss.",,"Very simplistic take. Currency system is way too complex for Bitcoin to replace it. The daily fluctuation price itself makes it simply unusable. And there's no real time solution for Bitcoin as of yet, it's simply not feasible due to the deflationary nature.
Crypto is not going anywhere, it will not really replace the existing currency, but will surely operate side by side.","Why not?

Crypto Currency,Governments Planning Global Coordinated Regulation of Crypto Currencies From October 2021 Onwards [Due Diligence],https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o9fd7l/governments_planning_global_coordinated/,"FATF basically wants crypto world to work in exactly the same way as banking world.
For western middle class, it might not sound too bad. However, for billions of people around the world, these tight regulations mean getting rejections from financial institutions like banks, brokerages, payment services etc. If you are third world citizen, your fate in tightly regulated world is to get messages like -  ""sorry but our service is not available in your region"".
When I still lived in Russia, I wanted to open foreign bank account in order to avoid possible crazy actions by Russian government. 2014 was a year of oil collapse, Russian Rouble losing half of its value within months, Crimea takeover followed by sanctions. Unfortunately, every single bank in Europe rejected me on the grounds that I'm not EU resident. They have private banking for wealthy individuals (2-5M+ EUR as minimum deposit) and they can open accounts for Russian citizens but I don't have that amount of money. Basically, if you want to open international bank account as holder of ""wrong"" citizenship, you have to compensate banks their compliance costs and risks of possible penalty.
So the end result of these regulations is barring regular people from third world but still allowing corrupt Russian oligarchs to launder money because they have unlimited cash to compensate bank's compliance costs and risks (one of many examples how tight government regulations benefit the rich and big corporations at the expense of everybody else).
I had similar problems with American brokerages. Before 2012, most online brokerages were available for Russians but one by one, they stopped accepting new customers and later they booted existing Russian customers. The only way for Russian resident to keep fiat money abroad and investing in US stock market for example is to use brokerages-intermediaries registered outside of US. However, just a few weeks ago Russian central bank black listed these brokerages. So not only western countries aren't welcome third world citizens but also local governments don't want you to move money abroad.
Even when I moved to the first world (SE, NL, HK), I still sometimes get rejected by banks on the grounds of my ""country of domicile"" (basically what banks consider to be your home country). Also when I moved from NL to HK, Dutch bank wasn't happy that I didn't close my account before I moved to HK (they sent me long letter from their KYC/AML department).
You might say - but all these regulations are to prevent criminals doing bad stuff. I have two answers to that. The first answer is that all corrupt Russian elite still keep their money in Europe without any issues while small people like me suffer from all these useless regulations. The second answer is that something is fundamentally wrong with regulations if you bar billion people from global finance in order to catch 0.1% of small/middle criminals while allowing big Russian oligarchs to launder billions of dollars.
You might also say - but those are private companies are rejecting you, not governments. My answer is that governments aren't that stupid, they clearly realize how their regulations change behavior of private companies. They just don't care and their voters also don't care. It's only people like me get booted and everybody else is happy (politicians, voters, bankers and Russian oligarchs).
This is why I'm so excited about crypto (because I already tried what traditional finance looks like). So I'm not making up ideology from thin air. Rather, my crypto thesis is coming from real and very negative experience with traditional finance built by western regulators like FATF.
I don't want to get back to the world of ""sorry but our service is not available in your region"". That's why I love crypto and I have deep contempt towards all these regulators.",Very well written and informative experience that sheds light on the bigger picture,,"Very well said.
The world of international/borderless finance via mobile phone, not under the thumb of big banking/government Eye is here and its spooking those in control.",

CHRONIQUE
St√©phane Foucart
La plupart des candidats √† l‚Äô√©lection pr√©sidentielle pr√©tendent concilier la poursuite de la croissance et la pr√©servation de l‚Äôenvironnement. Une r√©cente note de l‚ÄôAgence europ√©enne pour l‚Äôenvironnement souligne l‚Äôincompatibilit√© de ces deux projets, rel√®ve dans sa chronique St√©phane Foucart, journaliste au ¬´¬†Monde¬†¬ª.
Aujourd‚Äôhui √† 01h46, mis √† jour √† 06h51.Lecture 4 min.
Chronique.¬†Une fois n‚Äôest pas coutume, la d√©croissance s‚Äôest bri√®vement install√©e dans le d√©bat public, en particulier √† la faveur de la primaire √©cologiste,¬†remport√©e le 28¬†septembre par Yannick Jadot. Le mot m√™me a un tel pouvoir excommunicateur, et agit comme un si puissant repoussoir pour une majorit√© de l‚Äôopinion et des dirigeants qu‚Äôil est tr√®s rare de voir des responsables politiques, fussent-ils √©cologistes, le reprendre √† leur compte dans leurs discours ou leur programme. On les comprend¬†: les derni√®res semaines ont montr√© qu‚Äôil √©tait politiquement et m√©diatiquement moins co√ªteux de se livrer √† un r√©visionnisme de bas √©tage que d‚Äôinterroger le dogme de la croissance¬†ad vitam aeternam¬†du produit int√©rieur brut (PIB). Eric Piolle, √©galement candidat √† la primaire √©cologiste, ne s‚Äôy est pas tromp√© et a affich√© une posture prudemment agnostique, tandis que Yannick Jadot a pr√©f√©r√© s‚Äôinscrire dans le cadre de la ¬´¬†croissance verte¬†¬ª ‚Äì dont nul ne sait √† ce jour si elle existe r√©ellement.
A l‚Äôinverse, les candidates Delphine Batho et, dans une certaine mesure, Sandrine Rousseau ont affirm√© leur volont√© de rompre avec ce qui demeure, pour l‚Äô√©crasante majorit√© d‚Äôentre nous, le principal indicateur du succ√®s des politiques publiques. La probabilit√© que ce positionnement fasse flor√®s hors de l‚Äô√©cologie politique est tr√®s faible¬†: historiquement, toutes les remises en cause de l‚Äôexigence de croissance et tous les travaux acad√©miques montrant l‚Äôinanit√© de cet indicateur (il en existe un tr√®s grand nombre) ont suscit√© un int√©r√™t bref et souvent confidentiel, avant de dispara√Ætre de l‚Äôhorizon.
D√©couplage ¬´¬†impossible¬†¬ª
¬´¬†La croissance est ancr√©e dans la culture, la politique et les institutions,¬†r√©sume dans une note r√©cente l‚ÄôAgence europ√©enne pour l‚Äôenvironnement (EEA), une instance officielle de l‚ÄôUnion dont les productions demeurent consultatives.¬†Dans le monde entier, la l√©gitimit√© des gouvernements est indissociable de leur capacit√© √† assurer la croissance √©conomique et √† cr√©er des emplois.¬†¬ª¬†L‚Äôid√©e d‚Äôun monde √©conomiquement stationnaire nous est impensable. Dans sa note, l‚ÄôEEA propose un √©tat des lieux du d√©bat sur les liens entre environnement et croissance du PIB. Premi√®re information¬†: depuis 1970, √† l‚Äô√©chelle mondiale, la croissance √©conomique est, sans grande surprise, tr√®s √©troitement corr√©l√©e √† l‚Äôempreinte des soci√©t√©s sur leur environnement et √† leurs √©missions de gaz √† effet de serre. Les rares p√©riodes de diminution de l‚Äôimpact de nos activit√©s co√Øncident avec les crises √©conomiques ‚Äì autrement dit de la r√©cession pour les uns, ou de la d√©croissance pour les autres. Ainsi, jusqu‚Äô√† pr√©sent, la croissance a toujours √©t√© aliment√©e par une augmentation des flux de mati√®res et d‚Äô√©nergie, c‚Äôest-√†-dire par la consommation et la transformation de ressources naturelles. A aucun moment de l‚Äôhistoire r√©cente le PIB n‚Äôa grimp√© en m√™me temps que l‚Äôempreinte de l‚Äôhumanit√© sur son environnement chutait. Au point, dit l‚ÄôEEA dans sa note, que¬†¬´¬†le d√©couplage entre la croissance et la consommation de ressources pourrait √™tre impossible¬†¬ª. La ¬´¬†croissance verte¬†¬ª pourrait n‚Äô√™tre rien d‚Äôautre qu‚Äôun mythe ‚Äì qu‚Äôil faudrait sans doute qualifier de ¬´¬†fake news¬†¬ª si l‚Äôon prenait au s√©rieux les lois de la thermodynamique.
Puissance des m√©canismes de march√©
L‚Äôagence note que, en¬†2019, malgr√© des r√©glementations parmi les plus ambitieuses au monde, seuls 12¬†% des ressources mat√©rielles utilis√©es en Europe provenaient du recyclage. La circularisation compl√®te des √©conomies est impossible, estime en outre l‚ÄôEEA. Pourtant, malgr√© ce faisceau d‚Äôindices, la grande majorit√© de l‚Äôopinion et des dirigeants continue de croire compatibles la poursuite ind√©finie de la croissance √©conomique, d‚Äôune part, et la pr√©servation du climat et de la biodiversit√©, d‚Äôautre part. Sans pr√©tendre trancher la question, il s‚Äôagit en l‚Äô√©tat d‚Äôune simple profession de foi. Elle est rendue possible par une vision du monde issue de la science √©conomique, o√π la mat√©rialit√© du monde tend √† s‚Äôeffacer, √† devenir une consid√©ration de second ordre devant la puissance des m√©canismes de march√© et l‚Äôabstraction des jeux d‚Äô√©critures comptables. Milton Friedman, l‚Äôun des √©conomistes les plus influents des derni√®res d√©cennies, r√©pondant √† une journaliste qui l‚Äôinterrogeait sur¬†¬´¬†l‚Äôillusion de la disponibilit√© sans limites du p√©trole¬†¬ª,¬†fit cette remarque¬†:¬†¬´¬†Pourquoi une illusion¬†? Pardonnez-moi, mais ce n‚Äôest pas limit√© d‚Äôun point de vue √©conomique¬†: vous devez s√©parer l‚Äô√©conomie du point de vue physique des choses¬†¬ª¬†(Economists and the Environment¬†: A Diverse Dialogue,¬†de Carla Ravaioli et Paul Ekins, Zed Books, 1995, non traduit).
Le r√™ve d‚Äôune poursuite de la croissance
L‚Äôid√©e qu‚Äôil soit possible d‚Äôop√©rer une transition rapide, des formes actuelles de croissance √† une ¬´¬†croissance verte¬†¬ª sans impact sur le climat et l‚Äôenvironnement, tient √† ce type de consid√©ration ‚Äì¬†¬´¬†s√©parer l‚Äô√©conomie du point de vue physique des choses¬†¬ª.¬†Cette croyance irrigue toute la soci√©t√©, se renforce √† mesure que l‚Äôon monte dans la hi√©rarchie sociale. Elle permet de maintenir dans les discours politiques, de l‚Äôextr√™me droite √† l‚Äôextr√™me gauche, l‚Äôid√©e que l‚Äôexigence de sauvegarde du climat et de l‚Äôenvironnement peut cohabiter avec le r√™ve d‚Äôune poursuite de la croissance, moyennant quelques ajustements. ¬´¬†Une r√©duction de la pression et des impacts sur l‚Äôenvironnement exigerait des transformations fondamentales, afin d‚Äôaller vers un diff√©rent type d‚Äô√©conomie et de soci√©t√©,¬†dit l‚ÄôEEA,¬†au lieu de chercher des gains progressifs d‚Äôefficience dans le fonctionnement des syst√®mes de production et de consommation actuels.¬†¬ª¬†Pour la plus grande part d‚Äôentre nous, une telle r√©volution culturelle semble √† ce jour impossible. Mais il suffit de se projeter dans un monde r√©chauff√© de deux degr√©s suppl√©mentaires pour se demander si nous avons vraiment le choix.","""pourrait' mdr"

Crypto Currency,Sneak Peek: Upcoming payment platform for NANO (and other) crypto currencies.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/pdrj08/sneak_peek_upcoming_payment_platform_for_nano_and/,"Good morning,
I've been busy at work since my last
. Lots to do still, but here is a sneak peek!!
What you're looking at, is what I came up to be able to accept NANO on my
. And you‚Äôll be able to use too.
That's right!
I went and built a whole 'nother service, just to take payment on my first service. But I'll be honest. I'm having fun building it.
Right...here's how it'll work. Ever heard of
?- Well, I built one for NANO. It will let you (with just one API call) create customized, checkout pages on demand. Donations, Goods, Services.. You name it.
Thats nice and all, but how much will it cost?
Nothing. $0. This service will never touch your money. Funds go from Payee to you, directly to your address. It won't feel right otherwise.
For the time being, this will be developer oriented. Nice REST API and Documentation to go with it. You can use your favorite language.
This, in my opinion is how adoption accelerates to new speeds!
Edit: Dang it, I left out some screenshots. Everything is customizable! The colors, the images, the text strings (for translation). This checkout API is something I‚Äôve been dreaming about for months. Out of frustration with Stripe. Nano lit a üî• in me to get it done.
Edit 2: I expect this to be in public Beta by end of next week, if not earlier!
Edit 3: Please scroll around this thread to some of my answers, I‚Äôve done my best to answer common and interesting questions.","If it's non-custodial, then why SaaS? Why not open source it so I can run my own instance?",,"So awesome you‚Äôre working on this. Agreed with you, this is one of the biggest hurdles to adoption. Business access to Nano is still limited because it‚Äôs not streamlined to work with. This will light a fire if it‚Äôs good, and you seem like you have the skill to pull it off.","If 2 people (or 2000 people) are ordering the same coffee at once, how do you know which ones have paid and which ones haven't?
A custodial service (or just a proxy address) is usually needed for that. Do you have another approach?"

The only relationship between my diet and my decision to be vaccinated is that both reflect tendencies to follow medical advice and to be proactively cautious about my health.
It's disappointing, though not entirely surprising, to hear that a plant-based group would erupt over Dr. Esselstyn getting vaccinated. Did people really expect that he wouldn't?","I guess so. I think people often don‚Äôt realize our plant based medical leaders are traditional md‚Äôs not naturopaths, chiropractors or witch doctors.",,"In any large population sample,  you get ~75% dumbass.

Plantbased,Is it possible for someone with RA to not be on any meds but only take Prednisone when they have really bad flareups? I‚Äôve been plantbased for 11 years and was hoping that can help keep me of meds but now my RAFactor is 440. Are there lighter meds than methotrexate? Please advise.,https://www.reddit.com/r/rheumatoidarthritis/comments/omvpp5/is_it_possible_for_someone_with_ra_to_not_be_on/,"I‚Äôve been a vegetarian for decades, including before having RA. You need to see a good rheumatologist and get real treatment. This is not a lifestyle disease.","Because of insurance problems I had my ra treat by er doctors who prescribed me large doses of Prednisone.  Because of my five year struggle to get insurance the constant Prednisone damaged my heart. I will also be dependent on Prednisone for as long as I live. If you want to understand addiction, have your body addicted to Prednisone. Long story shorter, I finally have a rhumatologist and I'm able to function better than before but it's been a long road to here. I need a cane or a walker. I have irreparable damage to my knees. I'll never fully straighten on leg again without surgery. I'm currently on biologics, and methotrexate (which I hate too but it helps) among other medications I take I'm currently on 15mg of prednisolone daily. I'm working on getting it down to between 5-10mg. My advice is to take the medication now, as prescribed. Be as proactive as you can. The Prednisone only masks the damage that's happening. And sometimes it's permanent. Fancy diets are cute but this isn't a fancy diet disease. This is a no joke, rest of your life disease that if treated early and with disease modifying drugs can make life so much better than fighting your way back. Plus the Prednisone weight gain.

Plantbased,My perspective on the plantbased food industry and why there is literally no way around it,https://www.reddit.com/r/VGFCInvestorsClub/comments/om922w/my_perspective_on_the_plantbased_food_industry/,"You are exactly right, it is only a matter of time before prioritizing these companies becomes essential. On top of the reasons you stated the required land space of the meat and dairy industry is unsustainable at the current levels of consumption (Meat based diets take up an estimated 20 times more land use than plant based diets). This industry goes hand and hand with renewable energy technologies.
Full disclosure, I myself am not a vegetarian and still consume quite a bit of meat (although been cutting back and incorporating meat-less meals). I do like the products that VGF has though, and I feel that it is a necessity to invest in these companies. In a similar fashion, I currently drive a gasoline powered vehicle but feel that electric vehicles need to be the future (or better yet sustainable mass transit). In both cases, our societies need to support these companies so they can have the proper infrastructure to support a shift in public behaviour towards sustainability.","Jup it is absolutely mindblowing that STILL there is almost no coverage about any of this this in most mass media. Just looking at some more facts: 1/3 of the words freshwater is used for animal agriculture, around 75% of the worlds farmland is used for growing animal food, 80-90% of the rainforest destruction is being done to make room for more cattle/more animal food.
And about driving EVs: Animal agriculture emits more co2 than ALL of transportation combined, all cars, planes, ships.. everything. And thats ‚Äöjust‚Äô the co2 it directly emits, which ignores all the destruction it causes and the potential co2 those destroyed forests and areas could bind if we let them rewild. Absolutely ecological insanity all around if you consider that recourses will be more and more scarce in the future. There is literally no way around companies like this growing.
There has to be a point when more people will realize this.",,,
